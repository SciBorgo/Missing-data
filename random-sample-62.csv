While, providing access to live broadcast of European soccer competitions, SVCs have developed into supplementary social spaces where culturally defined rules of social relations are contested. Using Goffman's notion of performance and Agbalagba in Yoruba normative system, in conjunction with sociological perspective on space, the study explores the context and processes in the transformation of age social relations in Ibadan, South-Western Nigeria. Data were obtained through participant observation, and 23 in-depth interviews with viewing centre owners and soccer fans. Findings depict the SVC as a constructed space, with conflicting meanings, attitudes and practices, which inadvertently fracture and render fluid, the expectations of norms of age social relations. In conclusion, European soccer drives the spread of supplementary social spaces which impact local social structures in critical ways.

A concurrent validity and between-device reliability study","Biology of Sport",NA,"0860021X","",NA,"The purpose of this study was to (1) provide data on maximal sprinting speed (MSS) and maximal acceleration (Amax) in elite rugby sevens players measured with GPS devices, (2) test the concurrent validity of the signal derived from a radar device and a commercially available 16 Hz GPS device, and (2) assess the betweendevice reliability of MSS and Amax of the same GPS. Fifteen elite rugby sevens players (90 ± 12 kg; 181 ± 8 cm; 26 ± 5 y) participated in the maximal sprinting test. A subset of five players participated in the concurrent validity and between-devices reliability study. A concurrent validity protocol compared the GPS units and a radar device (Stalker ATS II). The between-device reliability of the GPS signal during maximal sprint running was also assessed using 6 V2 GPS units (Sensoreverywhere, Digital Simulation, Paris, France) attached to a custom-made steel sled and pushed by the five athletes who performed a combined total of 15 linear 40m sprints. CV ranged from 0.5, ±0.1 % for MSS and smoothed MSS to 6.4, ±1.1 % for Amax. TEM was trivial for MSS and smoothed MSS (0.09, ±0.01) and small for Amax and smoothed Amax (0.54, ±0.09 and 0.39, ±0.06 respectively). Mean bias ranged from -1.6, ±1.0 % to -3.0, ±1.1 % for smoothed MSS and MSS respectively. TEE were small (2.0, ±0.55 to 1.6, ±0.4 %, for MSS and smoothed MSS respectively. The main results indicate that the GPS units were highly reliable for assessing MSS and provided acceptable signal to noise ratio for measuring Amax, especially when a smoothing 0.5-s moving average is used. This 16 Hz GPS device provides sport scientists and coaches with an accurate and reliable means to monitor running performance in elite rugby sevens.

The purpose of this study was to examine and compare the internal training load and session rating of perceived exertion between coaches' and young soccer players' during three weeks in different training phases. Method: Participants were 16 male elite Under19 soccer players and their coaches. Before each training session, the coaches reported a session rating of perceived exertion using the Borg CR-10 scale as well as the planned duration (min) of the training based on prior planning, while the athletes responded the scale after each training session. Results: No differences in intensity session rating of perceived exertion (t = 0.49; p = 0.62) and training load (t = 0.18; p = 0.86) were observed between coaches and players during the training period analyzed. During different training phases, no significant differences were found during intensification (t = 0.18; p = 0.85) and taper (t = -0.19; p = 0.85) in training loads and in the session rating of perceived exertion prescribed by coaches and perceived by players. A very large correlation was observed between coaches training load (r= 0.84) and players training load. However, a trivial correlation was found between players training load and changes in the Yo-yo IR1 performance (r= -0.09), age (r= -0.06) and years of competitive experience (r= -0.08). Stepwise linear regression revealed that coaches training load (F1; 238= 582.7; R2= 0.710; p<0.001) explained 71% of the variance in players training load. Conclusion: The results suggest that the session rating of perceived exertion and training load prescribed during three weeks in different training phases (by coaches) was not different from perceived by young soccer players. Moreover, coaches training load seem to be effective to predict the training load in soccer players. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR Objetivo: En nuestro conocimiento, la información sobre la concordáncia entre la percepción subjetiva del esfuerzo durante el entrenamiento de entrenadores y de jóvenes julgadores de fútbol, durante los períodos específicos de entrenamiento (intensificación y reducción de cargas), no se ha establecido. El propósito de este estudio fue examinar y comparar la carga interna de entrenamiento y la percepción subjetiva del esfuerzo durante el entrenamiento entre los entrenadores y jóvenes jugadores de fútbol durante tres semanas en diferentes fases de formación. Método: Participaron 16 jugadores de fútbol sub19 y sus entrenadores. Antes de cada sesión de entrenamiento, los entrenadores informaron una clasificación del esfuerzo de sesión percibido usando la escala Borg CR-10 así como la duración planificada (min) de la capacitación basada en la planificación previa, mientras que los atletas respondieron la escala después de cada sesión de entrenamiento. Resultados: No se observaron diferencias en la percepción subjetiva del esfuerzo durante el entrenamiento (t = 0.49; p = 0.62) y la carga de entrenamiento (t = 0.18; p = 0.86) entre el entrenador y los jugadores durante el período de entrenamiento analizado. Durante las diferentes fases de entrenamiento no se encontraron diferencias significativas durante la intensificación (t = 0.18; p = 0.85) ni la reducción de cargas (t = -0.19; p = 0.85), en las cargas de entrenamiento y en la percepción subjetiva del esfuerzo, durante el entrenamiento prescrito por el entrenador y percibido por los julgadores. Se observaron correlaciones muy grandes entre la carga de entrenamiento de los entrenadores (r = 0.84) y la carga de entrenamiento de los jugadores. Sin embargo, se encontró una correlación trivial entre la carga de entrenamiento de los jugadores y los cambios en el rendimiento del Yo-yo IR1 (r = -0.09), edad (r = -0.06) y años de experiencia competitiva (r = -0.08). La regresión lineal múltiple reveló que la carga de entrenamiento de los entrenadores (F1; 238 = 582.7, R2 = 0.710, p <0.001) explicó el 71% de la varianza en la carga de entrenamiento de los jugadores.Los resultados sugieren que la percepcion subjetiva del esfuerzo durante el entrenamiento prescrito durante tres semanas, en diferentesfases de entrenamiento, no fue diferente de lo percibido por los jugadores jovenes de futbol. Ademas, la carga de entrenamiento de los entrenadores parece ser eficaz para predecir la carga de entrenamiento en estos jugadores.

METHODS: A four-season (2012/2013-2015/2016) prospective cohort study of injuries in professional level (club and international) rugby union. Incidence (injuries/1000 player-match-hours), severity (days lost per injury) and number of professional matches conferring a large risk of concussion were determined. The risk of injury following concussion was assessed using a survival model. RESULTS: Concussion incidence increased from 7.9 (95% CI 5.1 to 11.7) to 21.5 injuries/1000 player-match-hours (95% CI 16.4 to 27.6) over the four seasons for combined club and international rugby union. Concussion severity was unchanged over time (median: 9 days). Players were at a greater risk of sustaining a concussion than not after an exposure of 25 matches (95% CI 19 to 32). Injury risk (any injury) was 38% greater (HR 1.38; 95% CI 1.21 to 1.56) following concussion than after a non-concussive injury. Injuries to the head and neck (HR 1.34; 95% CI 1.06 to 1.70), upper limb (HR 1.59; 95% CI 1.19 to 2.12), pelvic region (HR 2.07; 95% CI 1.18 to 3.65) and the lower limb (HR 1.60; 95% CI 1.21 to 2.10) were more likely following concussion than after a non-concussive injury. CONCLUSION: Concussion incidence increased, while severity remained unchanged, during the 4 years of this study. Playing more than 25 matches in the 2015/2016 season meant that sustaining concussion was more likely than not sustaining concussion. The 38% greater injury risk after concussive injury (compared with non-concussive injury) suggests return to play protocols warrant investigation.","2019","2020-05-20 00:33:49","2020-05-20 00:33:49",NA,"969-973",NA,"15","53",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Medline",NA,NA,NA,"; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bjsports-2017-098417; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628779853","human; male; football; sport injury; injury; brain concussion; incidence; prospective study; season; physiology; competitive behavior; recurrent disease; severity of illness index; Wales",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

The authors suggest that as ""unusual suspects"" in social movements, Çarşı's role in the Gezi Park protests can be understood with the conceptual toolbox provided by theories of contentious politics. Since action repertoires, or ""known sequences for acting together,"" are key to contentious politics and social movements, Çarşı's organized and effective performance during the Gezi Park protests shows how previous encounters with the police can be decisive in terms of social upheavals. This study suggests that Çarşı members, who were already accustomed to making ethical judgments on a variety of issues both political and non-political, should be taken as a prominent example of how supporters on terraces and fan clubs facilitate the framing processes described by the social movement literature.

Methods: Collegiate female soccer and lacrosse players participated in this study. 18 athletes had at least 1 prior ACLI (age=20.6+1.3 yrs; height=169.0+6.0 cm; weight=65.7+6.1 kg), and 40 athletes had no prior ACLI (age=19.5+1.3 yrs; height=166.4+6.4 cm; weight=64.4+8.6 kg). Athletes completed 3 trials of a DVJ task. The involved limb was randomly assigned in those with no prior ACLI. Kinetics were collected via two inground force plates. Peak vertical ground reaction force (vGRF) of the involved limb, peak vGRF limb symmetry index (LSI), and time to peak vGRF of the involved limb were extracted and normalized to body weight (bw). Independent t-tests were calculated to compare each kinetic variable by ACLI history. Results: Those with a prior ACLI had lower peak vGRF in their involved limb (1.92 ± 0.48 bw) than those without ACLI (2.24 ± 0.55 bw); p=0.04. They had less limb symmetry of their peak vGRF (87.9 ± 25.8%) than those without (104.2 ± 21.8%; p=0.02). They reached this peak later after ground contact (58.1 ± 33.7 ms) than those without (44.0 ± 19.3 ms; p=.049). Conclusion: Females who play collegiate sports following ACLI have differences in their landing kinetics compared to their previously uninjured teammates. They have a lesser peak vGRF on their involved limb and take longer to reach this peak. These factors, combined with a greater asymmetry of the magnitude of this peak between limbs, suggest that they continue to offload and delay loading of their involved limb during double limb jumping tasks. Clinical implications: Even athletes who successfully play collegiate sports following ACLI have kinetic differences relative to their uninjured peers. Further research should explore how these differences affect future injury risk and long-term joint health.

J Strength Cond Res 33(5): 1222-1231,2019—This study evaluates the weekly natural log of the root-mean-square difference of successive R-R intervals (lnRMSSDmean), its coefficient of variation (lnRMSSDcv), training load (TL), stress tolerance (ST), and changes in intermittent running performance in response to a 2-week overload (OL) followed by a 1 -week taper (TP) during a preseason. Additionally, we determined the relationships between these variables. Ultra-short InRMSSD, psychometric responses, and ratings of perceived exertion were evaluated daily among 16 under-19 soccer players. At the end of each training phase, the athletes performed the Yo- Yo Intermittent Recovery test level 1 (Yo-Yo). Group analysis showed a decrease in lnRMSSDmean and ST, increases in lnRMSSDcv, and decreases in the Yo-Yo during OL, with a return to baseline levels and a trivial increase in the Yo-Yo during TP. Small to very large correlations were found between lnRMSSDmean and lnRMSSDcv values, with changes in Yo-Yo, TL, monotony, and strain during the preseason (rvalues ranging from -0 .2 7 to 0.82). No correlation was found between InRMSSD responses and ST. During OL, athletes with decreases in lnRMSSDmean and increases in lnRMSSDcv accumulated higher perceived TL, with higher monotony and overall stress, and presented a decrease in ST and intermittent running performance, interpreted as a negative adaptation in response to the maintenance of higher TL. During TP, these responses were reversed, leading to an increase in intermittent running performance. In addition, subjective measures of ST may be used to provide early indicators of training adaptation in soccer players.

However, it was during the 1950s that a European scale was established primarily due to the creation of UEFA (Union of European Football Associations) in 1954, which quickly organized the first European tournament in the game's history– The European Champions Clubs' Cup. The present essay argues that Europeanization of the game has to be understood in a long-term perspective. The papers examines the creation and development of three competitions as key defining events, which represented different stages of the Europeanization of the game: Mitropa Cup (created in 1927), European Champion Clubs' Cup (created in 1955) and UEFA Cup (created in 1971). Thus, afocus on these cases can help us better understand the background of the Europeanization of the game which happened during the 1990s.

Ten expert and professional coaches' (M = 46,9 ± 7,93 years old andM= 15,4 ± 7,22 years of coaching experience) from different countries were interviewed using asemi-structured interview (quantitative and qualitative) with two different goals: (1) evaluate the preparation for decision-making moment during the game; (2) classifying the importance of different game related points for decision-making during match moment. The data analysis was processed through combination of deductive and inductive methods through software QSR NVivo 11. The results revealed that coaches' share similar ideas when preparing their teams. Coaches focus first their attention on their own team identity and frame andsecond on opposition team behaviour and frame. It was also possible to identify clear coaching behavioural signs possible to be structured as cues and guiding lines for their decision-making process and actions before and during competitive moments. Such information can be important for the development of most appropriated coaching education curriculums according to game demands specificities.

Materials and methods: A total of 60 female football players (U-16 and U-18) performed bilateral and unilateral countermovement jump tests, a single leg hop test, a 40-m linear speed test, and two CODA tests on two occasions separated by 5–7 days to assess test-retest reliability. Furthermore, test sensitivity was also calculated. Finally, 52 players performed each test three times throughout the season to analyse those performance changes. Results: Reliability scores showed a priori acceptable values in U-16 (ICC = 0.76–0.94; CV = 1.0–4.8%) and U-18 (ICC = 0.75–0.99; CV = 1.0–3.6%) in all tests. All tests were sensitive to detect large changes at both short- and mid-term with the exception of the V-cut test (only at short-tem) in both groups. Seasonal changes were mainly produced between baseline and Test 3 in linear sprinting and jumping measurements in U-16 and U-18, respectively. Conclusions: Jumping, linear sprinting and CODA tests are reliable and can detect moderate to large performance changes and they could be used to monitor their performance in U-16 and U-18 female football players.

The study was conducted at the training facility of a community soccer association in the Ottawa area. Participants: A convenience sample of 83 soccer players between the ages of 10 to 14 was recruited over 4 consecutive weeks of summer soccer camp. Main outcome measures: Concussion knowledge and attitudes were measured using the Concussion Knowledge and Attitude Questionnaire (CKAT) before, after and at one-month post education. Objectif : Un essai contrôlé randomisé par groupe a servi à comparer l'efficacité de la présentation par diapositives du cours de ParachuteMC intitulé «Sensibilisation aux commotions cérébrales pour les sportifs» (SCCS) (groupe d'intervention), comparativement au fait de fournir uniquement les informations écrites de ParachuteMC sur les commotions cérébrales (groupe témoin). Cette étude a été menée au centre d'entraînement d'une association communautaire de soccer de la région d'Ottawa. Participants : Un échantillon de commodité de 83 joueurs de soccer âgés de 10 à 14 ans a été recruté au cours des 4 semaines consécutives d'un camp d'été de soccer. Mesures principales des résultats : Les connaissances et les attitudes vis-à-vis des commotions cérébrales ont été mesurées à l'aide du Concussion Knowledge and Attitude Questionnaire (CKAT) avant et après la formation, ainsi qu'un mois suivant cette dernière. Results: The provision of the standardized PCAP concussion education program resulted in a statistically significant increase in mean knowledge scores (p=0.004) compared to the provision of standardized written material. A significant effect of time (p<0.001) was noted in both the intervention and control groups demonstrating a higher attitude score after the education. Conclusions: The provision of standardized core curriculum to children improved their ability to appropriately identify concussion symptoms. Regardless of how standardized education was provided, improvement in concussion attitude scores was noted. Increasing children's general attitude toward concussion may empower them to report their symptoms to a parent or coach. Résultats : La mise en œuvre du programme éducatif normalisé sur les commotions cérébrales SCCS de ParachuteMC a entraîné une augmentation statistique considérable des scores de connaissances moyens (p=0,004) par rapport à la présentation de matériel écrit normalisé.

Sixty young elite male soccer players were assigned into three equal groups (n = 20): children, young adolescents and older adolescents, and performed five maximal concentric and eccentric hip-abductions and adductions at 30o/s and 90o/s. The results showed a significant increase (p < 0.05) in peak torque values from childhood to adolescence, with the exception of young adolescents vs. older adolescents where no differences were observed. The reciprocal ratios were not affected by age, but improved with an increase in angular velocity with the exception of the CON/ECC ratio that was higher at 30o/s.

Therefore, under such circumstances, all kinds of science and technology have been promoted to be widely applied in all fields, and eventually to be widely popularized. Under this background, in the field of education in our country, with the in-depth popularization of Internet information technology, the era of multimedia education has thus emerged. Micro-video transmits information to the outside world through multimedia methods such as images, animations and pictures. Due to its short, precise and fast characteristics, micro-video is more suitable for people's needs in the current fast pace of life. Under such circumstances, this technology has been widely and effectively applied in the field of education. On the basis of in-depth reform of the education system, the teaching mode of micro-class video has also been applied to school physical education. Methods: Students can also feedback their knowledge to teachers through micro-videos. In this case, teachers can give targeted guidance to students' actions. Such as WeChat video, which is widely used at present, after-class exercises can effectively improve the training level of students, and correct and efficient learning guidance for students through micro video can not only improve the training level of students, but also increase the affection between teachers and students. Results: For this reason, this paper first makes an in-depth analysis of the advantages of micro-video resources teaching, and then makes a detailed exploration of the application of micro-video resources in football classroom teaching and technical teaching on this basis, hoping to lay a foundation for the continuous improvement of football teaching effectiveness and quality, the improvement of students' learning enthusiasm and the long-term development of football. Conclusions: In general, the reasonable application of micro-video resources to sports football teaching can enrich the teaching content of sports courses, which plays a positive and auxiliary role in both theoretical teaching and practical teaching. This teaching method can more effectively stimulate students' interest in learning sports football, improve students' learning ability, reduce teachers' teaching pressure to varying degrees, and improve teachers' teaching effect and quality. It is a scientific and technological teaching method used by non-value educators.","2019","2020-05-20 00:08:13","2020-05-20 00:08:13",NA,"68-69",NA,"SUPPL, 9","125",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Embase",NA,NA,NA,"","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L631567213","conference abstract; human; human experiment; theoretical study; football; exercise; sport; learning; multimedia; teacher; teaching; videorecording",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of men who had played in the NFL after 1960. Participants were studied using a standardized self-administered questionnaire designed to determine both the exposure history to ASF and the prevalence of chronic pain, sleep apnea, cardiometabolic disease, and neurocognitive impairment. Logistic regression and negative binomial regression models were used to assess associations between age, ethnicity, body-mass index during professional football career, field position, and football career duration with individual and multiple afflictions. RESULTS: In this cohort of former NFL players (n = 3745), approximately one quarter of the eligible former players (27%) reported two or more medical afflictions (chronic pain, cardiometabolic disease, sleep apnea, or neurocognitive impairment). Career duration was significantly associated with an increase in the number of comorbidities. Age, race, and body-mass index were associated with all affliction categories, other than neurocognitive impairment, which was similarly prevalent in middle-aged players and older players. Earlier age when first playing the sport was protective against cardiometabolic affliction. CONCLUSIONS: Former NFL players report significant combinations of cross-system afflictions. Future work will be required to determine mechanistic underpinnings. However, attention to the whole player, rather than specific organ systems seems critical to improve long-term health outcomes in former ASF professional athletes.","2019","2020-05-20 00:32:13","2020-05-20 00:32:13",NA,"655-662",NA,"8","62",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Medline",NA,NA,NA,"; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ajim.22992; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628053276","adult; human; male; article; football; controlled study; major clinical study; athlete; body mass; cohort analysis; ethnicity; race; questionnaire; retrospective study; attention; prevalence; career; middle aged; comorbidity; aging; sleep disordered breathing; chronic pain; organ systems",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Methods: The first season of AFLW technical data were analysed. All matches (n = 26) were separated into winning and losing subsets and score margins were recorded. To investigate the influence of technical involvements on overall performance, final ladder position was also recorded. Results: Uncontested possessions and the ratio between the number of times the ball was inside the attacking 50-m zone (inside 50s) and goals scored, were identified as the biggest predictors of match outcomes in the AFLW. Larger winning margins were associated with reduced marks ""inside 50"" and a lower inside 50: goals scored ratio. Kicks and contested marks demonstrated significant relationships with final ladder position, with these involvements decreasing as the ladder position moved closer to eight. Conclusions: Team game plans should promote the importance of finding space and completing a number of passes in the attacking 50-m zone to allow closer shots on goal. Further to this, coaches may need to draft players who are able to ""win"" marking contests to improve ladder position in the future seasons..

Players were monitored for a period of 4 training weeks, corresponding to the beginning of the competitive period. During this period, physical training sought to improve lower limb power. At the beginning and end of the training period, the following tests were performed: Squat jump (SJ), Countermovement jump (CMJ), 15-meter speed (Vel_15m) and Futsal Intermittent Endurance Test (FIET). The training load was monitored by the Session Perceived Exertion method. Weeks 1 and 3 presented higher training load than weeks 2 and 4 (p <0.01). In the post-training period, shorter running time in the Vel_15m test (p = 0.04), greater height in SJ (p <0.01) and CMJ (p <0.01) tests, and higher maximal speed in FIET (p = 0.04) were observed. It could be concluded that directing training at the beginning of the competitive season to improve power increases the lower limb power of futsal players, with consequent improvement of speed and the ability to perform intermittent actions at high intensities.

While FMS provides information about core stability, movement patterns and dynamic balance, YBT is used only for evaluating dynamic balance. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationships between the results obtained from FMS and YBT evaluations in female soccer players. Material and Methods: Twenty-four female soccer players aged between 17-30 years were evaluated by an experienced physiotherapist in terms of FMS and YBT. Each movement was scored between 0 (not able to perform) and 3 (performed correctly) in FMS, which includes seven different movement tests. The YBT scores was obtained by using the standardized formula of the values obtained after measurements which were performed in three different directions with the help of an equipment. Results: The mean age was 21.1±4.0 years, mean FMS result was 16.6±1.6, mean right-side YBT results was 96.4±4.9%, mean left-side YBT was 96.3±4.1%. Using Spearman's correlation analysis, significant and moderate correlations were found between FMS results and right YBT results (rho:0.495; p:0.014), and FMS results and left YBT results (rho:0.512; p:0.011). Conclusions: According to our results, FMS and YBT scores, which are used as determinants of injury risk, are moderately related to each other in female soccer players. Thus, we believe, using FMS which includes more comprehensive evaluations might provide more detailed results about injury prediction for professionals who work in sports field.

METHODS: Injury history from 16 football teams in the Swedish male first football league was evaluated during five consecutive seasons. The team's medical staff recorded team exposure and time-loss injuries prospectively between 2012 and 2016. RESULTS: In total, 467 time-loss injuries located in the hip/groin area were recorded among 1,687 professional male football players, with an overall incidence and burden of 0.82/1,000 h and 15.6/1,000 h, respectively. There appeared to be an increased risk of hip/groin injuries during the last two seasons (2015-2016); however, the difference was not statistically significant (n.s). Recurrent injury rate was relatively low (14%), and overuse injuries accounted for the majority of injuries and absence days. Muscle injuries were the main injury type, while kicking and sprinting/running were the primary causes of injury. Goalkeepers had the lowest percentage of injuries and absence days. CONCLUSION: Hip/groin injuries are a substantial problem in football, but does not seem to be an increasing phenomenon in the Swedish male first football league. Index and overuse injuries accounted for the majority of injuries and absence days. Thus, the focus should be on preventing hip/groin injuries to lower the injury rate. These new findings should be taken into consideration when designing and implementing preventive training interventions.II.","2019","2020-05-20 00:20:13","2020-05-20 00:20:13",NA,"",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Medline",NA,NA,NA,"; ","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L626970624; http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00167-019-05470-x","adult; football player; human; male; article; soccer; hip; clinical article; controlled study; incidence; season; running; medical staff; inguinal region; risk factor; muscle injury; cumulative trauma disorder; prevention; Swedish citizen",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

To support this statement, the aims of this study were: (i) describe the collective behavioural patterns that relies upon the use of player positioning in interaction with teammates, opponents and ball positioning; (ii) and define the underlying structure among the variables through application of a factorial analysis. The sample comprised a total of 1,413 ball possession sequences, obtained from twelve elite football matches from one team (the team ended the season in the top-5 position). The dynamic position of the players (from both competing teams), as well as the ball, were captured and transformed to two-dimensional coordinates. Data included the ball possession sequences from six matches played against top opponents (TOP, the three teams classified in the first 3 places at the end of the season) and six matches against bottom opponents (BOTTOM, the three teams classified in the last 3 at the end of the season). The variables calculated for each ball possession were the following: ball position; team space in possession; game space (comprising the outfield players of both teams); position and space at the end of ball possession. Statistical comparisons were carried with magnitude-based decisions and null-hypothesis analysis and factor analysis to define the underlying structure among variables according to the considered contexts. Results showed that playing against TOP opponents, there was ~38 meters game length per ~43 meters game width with 12% of coefficient of variation (%). Ball possessions lasted for ~28 seconds and tended to end at ~83m of pitch length. Against BOTTOM opponents, a decrease in the game length with an increase in game width and in the deepest location was observed in comparison with playing against TOP opponents. The duration of ball possession increased considerable (~37 seconds), and the ball speed entropy was higher, suggesting lower levels of regularity in comparison with TOP opponents. The BOTTOM teams revealed a small EPS. The Principal Component Analysis showed a strong association of the ball speed, entropy of the ball speed and the coefficient of variation (%) of the ball speed. The EPS of the team in possession was well correlated with the game space, especially the game width facing TOP opponents. Against BOTTOM opponents, there was a strong association of ball possession duration, game width, distance covered by the ball, and length/width ratio of the ball movement. The overall approach carried out in this study may serve as the starting point to elaborate normative models of positioning behaviours measures to support the coaches’ operating decisions.","2019","2020-05-20 00:21:59","2020-05-20 00:21:59",NA,"",NA,"8","14",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Embase Medline",NA,NA,NA,"; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0221368; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002677579","human; article; football; season; velocity; pitch; principal component analysis; factor analysis; entropy; null hypothesis",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

By characterizing FIFA as a 'political machine' and using 'digital trace data' from Twitter to analyze responses to the most recent FIFA corruption scandal, this paper introduces a new methodological approach to the realm of research on sports governance. Key events of FIFA's corruption scandal trigger significant activities, but the attention is ephemeral as it decreases over time. In addition, there is little evidence that the corruption scandal has a detrimental effect on FIFA's legitimacy among users. Ultimately, online activism striving to change FIFA's governance seems to have only rudimentarily developed and is sparsely popular among individual football fans.

The reliability of potential fatigue-monitoring measures in elite youth soccer players. J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2019-Monitoring fatigue is of vital importance to practitioners; however, logistics and concerns about reliability may impede the use of certain measures. This study aimed to quantify the reliability of potential measures of fatigue; a subjective wellness questionnaire, jump performance tests, and tri-axial accelerometer variables derived during submaximal shuttle running in elite youth soccer players. A secondary aim was to establish the minimum test duration that could be used for the submaximal shuttle run while maintaining good reliability. Seventeen male youth team players (age: 17.4 ± 0.5 years) were assessed on 2 occasions, spaced 7 days apart. Typical error, coefficient of variation (CV%), interclass correlation (ICC), and minimum detectable change were calculated for a subjective wellness questionnaire, countermovement jump (CMJ), squat jump (SJ) and drop jump contact time (DJ-CT), drop jump height (DJ-JH), and reactive strength (DJ-RSI). A novel submaximal shuttle running test was also used to assess tri-axial accelerometer data reliability. Results suggest that CMJ, SJ, DJ-CT, and DJ-RSI have good test-retest reliability (CV% = 4.5-7.7; ICC = 0.80-0.88); however DJ-JH did not show acceptable reliability (CV% = 6.0; ICC = 0.76). Good reliability was found for all tri-axial accelerometer variables during a 3-minute (2-minute analysis) submaximal shuttle run (CV% = 2.4-8.0; ICC = 0.81-0.95), except for % PlayerLoad anterior-posterior (%PLAP) (CV% = 7.2; ICC = 0.63). The subjective wellness questionnaire demonstrated poor reliability for all items (CV% = 11.2-30.0; ICC = 0.00-0.78). The findings from this study provide practitioners with valuable information about the reliability of a range of potential fatigue-monitoring measures. This can be used to help make accurate decisions about the magnitude of change in these assessments when used in practice.","2019","2020-05-20 00:41:22","2020-05-20 00:41:22",NA,"",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Medline",NA,NA,NA,"; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1519/JSC.0000000000003317; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629262852","human; male; article; soccer player; controlled study; accelerometer; performance; adolescent; running; questionnaire; juvenile; fatigue; physician; minimum detectable change; contact time; quantitative analysis; test retest reliability",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Methods: In a fierce football game, the distance the athlete runs is about 9000 meters-15000 meters, the overall energy consumption is about 2000 calories, the weight loss is about 3∼4 kg or so. Causes the electrolyte in the body to be lost in large quantities with sweat. Causing the imbalance of electrolyte balance, muscle excitability and muscle spasm in vivo, dehydration, especially the cardiovascular system, the physiological function of the nervous system and the body's material metabolism of the corresponding obstacles, if the amount of body fluids is lost too much, there will be shock symptoms. Serious can often lead to death. The balance of water and electrolytes is regulated by the nervous system and certain hormones, which are mainly achieved through the effects of nerves, especially some hormones, on the treatment of water and electrolytes in the kidneys. Results: The change of body function in football matches will directly affect the technical and tactical performance of athletes in the match. Conclusions: To keep the electrolyte constant in the body, the human body should replenish the electrolyte properly in the game. Maintain body blood solvent balance, help nerve transport, regulate muscle contraction, and maintain acid-base balance.","2019","2020-05-20 00:16:20","2020-05-20 00:16:20",NA,"51-52",NA,"","125",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Embase",NA,NA,NA,"; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bcpt.13266; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628906542","conference abstract; human; football; controlled study; athlete; energy consumption; electrolyte; sweat; body weight loss; dehydration; water; death; nervous system; calorie; acid base balance; cardiovascular system; electrolyte balance; excitability; hormone; in vivo study; kidney; muscle spasm; nervous system function; solvent",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Football helmets are constantly improving upon their predecessors and are proven to reduce head impact kinematics and the risk of sports-related head injury. All football helmets are required to pass certification testing overseen by the National Operating Committee on Standards for Athletic Equipment (NOCSAE) before they are permitted for use. A new advance in protective equipment involves coupling a helmet and shoulder pads as one connected piece of protective equipment. These protective gears cannot be tested using the standard NOCSAE method as they are worn over a user's head, neck, and upper torso. We aimed to test the effectiveness of a prototype of a coupled, one-piece design, relative to a standard football helmet, using a custom drop tower method of testing. Relative to the standard football helmet, the coupled design reduced measures of peak linear acceleration at front, side, and rear impacts (p <.001) and peak rotational acceleration at all tested head locations (p <.004). The coupled design was also more effective than the standard helmet in attenuating the resultant upper neck force (p <.004) at all tested head impact locations and resultant upper neck moment at rear and side impact locations (p <.048). Future iterations of coupled, one-piece designs should use the results of this study to make improvements to the device, and further investigations on the effectiveness and safety implications of the protective gear are necessary.

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine whether sleep duration is an independent predictor of in-season injury in female youth soccer players. Methods: Adolescent female soccer players (13-18 years) from a single club were monitored for 2 years of formal competition (96 weeks). Participants recorded prior night sleep duration every morning, training load (session-rating of perceived exertion), and time-loss injuries throughout the study period. Data were aggregated weekly and 2, 3, and 4 week rolling averages were calculated as well as an acute:chronic ratio (A:C; weekly divided by 4 week) for both sleep and training load. Separate multivariable Poisson regression models were used to predict the number of weekly injuries throughout the study period using 1, 2, 3, and 4 week sleep averages and A:C sleep ratio from the preceding week, while adjusting for training load over the same time frame as a covariate. Results: 97 injuries were recorded during the study period. Average sleep during the study period was 7.93 ± 0.7 hours. After controlling for training load, weekly injuries were not significantly predicted by the preceding 1 week (OR=1.10 [0.51-2.3], p=0.81), 2 week (OR=1.05 [0.41-2.6], p=0.91), 3 week (OR=1.30 [0.41-4.0], p=0.65), or 4 week (OR=1.51 [0.40-5.6], p=0.54) sleep duration. However, decreased A:C sleep ratio was a significant predictor of increased injury the following week (OR=0.77 [0.59-0.98], p=0.043). Conclusion: After controlling for training load, decreased weekly sleep duration relative to the prior month is a significant, independent predictor of increased injuries the following week. This suggests that relative sleep restriction may offer a more sensitive predictor of injury risk than acute or chronic sleep duration alone. Monitoring of sleep duration may allow for individualized intervention to reduce the risk of injuries in adolescent female athletes.","2019","2020-05-20 00:07:20","2020-05-20 00:07:20",NA,"",NA,"2","144",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Embase",NA,NA,NA,"; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1542/peds.144.2-MeetingAbstract.192; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L630632264","adult; conference abstract; female; human; soccer player; injury; exercise; controlled study; major clinical study; prospective study; season; competition; adolescent; juvenile; night sleep; sleep time",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

The underlying injury risk may be the result of coordination differences that sport-specialized athletes have been speculated to exhibit relative to multisport athletes; however, little evidence exists to support or refute this notion. OBJECTIVE: To examine relative hip- and knee-joint angular-motion variability among adolescent sport-specialized and multisport female adolescent athletes to determine how sport specialization may affect coordination. DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: Research laboratory. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: A total of 366 sport-specialized and 366 multisport adolescent female basketball, soccer, and volleyball players. INTERVENTION(S): Drop-vertical-jump (DVJ) assessment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Average coupling-angle variability (CAV) for hip flexion and knee flexion, knee flexion and ankle flexion, hip flexion and knee abduction, knee flexion and knee abduction, knee flexion and knee internal rotation, and knee abduction and knee internal rotation. RESULTS: The sport-specialized group exhibited increased coupling variability in dominant-limb hip flexion and knee flexion (P = .015), knee flexion and knee abduction (P = .014), and knee flexion and knee internal rotation (P = .048) while landing during the DVJ, although they had small effect sizes (η2 = 0.010, 0.010, and 0.007, respectively). No differences were present between groups for any of the other CAV measures of the dominant limb, and no differences were found for any CAV measures of the nondominant limb (all P values > .05). CONCLUSIONS: Sport specialization was associated with increased variability of critical hip- and knee-joint couplings responsible for effective landing during the DVJ. Altered coordination strategies that involve the hip and knee joints may underlie unstable landings, inefficient force-absorption strategies, or greater contact forces that can place the lower extremities at risk for injury (or a combination of these).","2019","2020-05-20 00:46:17","2020-05-20 00:46:17",NA,"1105-1114",NA,"10","54",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Medline",NA,NA,NA,"; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.4085/1062-6050-407-18; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629646363","female; human; article; soccer; hip; basketball; controlled study; major clinical study; adolescent; athlete; cohort analysis; outcome assessment; motor performance; athletics; volleyball; effect size; abduction; ankle; knee function; rotation; musculoskeletal injury; cumulative trauma disorder; youth sport; specialization",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Return-to-play analysis fails to take into consideration how effective a player remains once returning to competition. The aims of this study are to provide a large-scale international analysis of return-to-play and player performance statistics among professional soccer athletes following ACLR. Methods: Using publicly available sources, professional soccer athletes who have undergone ACLR between the 1996 and 2015 seasons were identified. Player metrics including statistical performance, recovery time, and return-to-play rates were analyzed both before and after reconstruction. Furthermore, player performance statistics during each of three consecutive seasons post-ACLR were compared. Results: A total of 176 athletes who underwent ACLR were included in this study. The return-to-play rate was 93.2% (164 athletes). Cumulative post-surgical statistical analysis of ACLR players demonstrated fewer games/season, minutes/season, minutes/game, goals/season, and more fouls/season following ACLR (p < 0.04). Analysis of player performance statistics suggests that athletes do not return to their baseline number of games/season and minutes/game until two and three seasons post-ACLR, respectively. At three seasons post-ACLR, athletes are still starting fewer games/season and scoring fewer goals/90 min (p < 0.04). Conclusion: Return-to-play rate is high following ACLR; however, athletes exhibit poorer statistical performance, especially in the first few seasons upon return. Our data shows that athletes continue to start fewer games/season and score fewer goals/90 min at three seasons post-ACLR.","2019","2020-05-20 00:32:41","2020-05-20 00:32:41",NA,"142-148",NA,"1","26",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Embase Medline",NA,NA,NA,"; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.knee.2018.10.004; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2001286900","adult; football player; human; male; article; soccer; case report; clinical article; season; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; statistics; surgery; statistical analysis",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

OBJECTIVE: To compare the activation time of the quadriceps and hamstrings muscles during a movement that puts stress on anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) to assess the risk of ACL injury. DESIGN: Case series. SETTING: University laboratory for movement analysis. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: Twenty (10 males and 10 females) professional soccer players. INTERVENTION(S): An inertial sensor and 4 electrodes positioned on the quadriceps and hamstrings muscles were used for the surface electromyography. The athlete resting on 1 leg dropped, from a 32-cm-high platform, on the suspended foot (testing leg), without jumping or lowering his center of gravity and maintaining single-leg landing for 5 seconds. Using a software, it is possible to calculate the activation time of the rectus femoris, vastus medialis (VM), biceps femoris, and semimembranosus muscles before ground contact. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: To evaluate the activation times of the rectus femoris, VM, biceps femoris, and semitendinosus muscles before ground contact in comparison with the range of normality calculated by the manufacturer. RESULTS: All male soccer players demonstrated a low risk related to the correct activation of all the examined muscles, while female soccer players demonstrated delayed activation of the VM. CONCLUSIONS: Delayed activation of the VM registered in females determines an increase in anterior shear force, which is an important risk factor for incurring an ACL injury.

Twenty-five male players were recruited from the Londrina Junior Team Football Academy in Brazil and asked to either dribble the ball or sprint through five custom circuits that varied in average curvature (0-1.37 radians.m-1). These measures were then validated using a realistic one vs. one competition in which each player acted as attacker or defender in turn (N = 1330 bouts). Sprinting (ICC = 0.96) and dribbling (ICC = 0.97) performances were highly repeatable for individual players. Average dribbling speed decreased non-linearly with increasing circuit curvature (F = 239.5; P < 0.001) from 5.19 ± 0.11 ms-1 on the straightest path to 2.13 ± 0.03 ms-1 on the curviest. Overall, dribbling but not sprinting performance predicted attacking success in the one vs. one competition, explaining more than 50% of the variation in attacking success alone (rp = 0.70; P < 0.001). In conclusion, our new closed-skill dribbling assessment is a valid and reliable protocol to predict a soccer player's success in attacking performance in one vs. one situation, and can be used to identify talented players.","2019","2020-05-20 00:15:23","2020-05-20 00:15:23",NA,"1072-1079",NA,"9","37",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Medline",NA,NA,NA,"; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02640414.2018.1544110; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L627118930","human; male; soccer; adolescent; running; aptitude; athletic performance; task performance",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Our aim was to determine if group differences could be found in sensory regions involved in the perception of the world or were evident in higher-level regions that are important for the interpretation of sensory information. We measured brain responses from 2 groups of football supporters, while they watched a video of matches between their teams. The time-course of response was then compared between individuals supporting the same (within-group) or the different (between-group) team. We found high intersubject correlations in low-level and high-level regions of the visual brain. However, these regions of the brain did not show any group differences. Regions that showed higher correlations for individuals from the same group were found in a network of frontal and subcortical brain regions. The interplay between these regions suggests a range of cognitive processes from motor control to social cognition and reward are important in the establishment of social groups. These results suggest that group differences are primarily reflected in regions involved in the evaluation and interpretation of the sensory input.","2019","2020-05-20 00:32:46","2020-05-20 00:32:46",NA,"3380-3389",NA,"8","29",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Embase Medline",NA,NA,NA,"; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy206; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L631551033","adult; female; human; human experiment; male; article; football; controlled study; perception; videorecording; brain region; functional magnetic resonance imaging; motor control; nucleus accumbens; reward; sensory stimulation; social cognition",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

These players performed 4,716 tactical actions evaluated by System of Tactical Assessment in Soccer (FUT-SAT). Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation and percentage difference), Shapiro–Wilk test, independent t-test, Mann–Whitney test, paired t-test, and Cohen's kappa test were used. The results indicated that the champions' teams accomplished more offensive tactical actions (quantitatively) and were more efficient (qualitatively) in these actions than the other teams. In addition, the champions' teams were more effectiveness (action outcomes) in offensive and defensive movements. Otherwise, the runner-up and third-placed performed more (quantitatively) defensive tactical actions and were more efficient (qualitatively) in these actions. It is concluded that the champions' teams had more initiative in the matches due to the greater quantity and quality of their offensive tactical actions and more effectiveness in the offensive and defensive actions, while their opponents were reactive.

Three-dimensional motion data using 10 Qualisys Oqus 7 infrared cameras (240 Hz) and ground reaction force data from 2 AMTI force platforms (1,200 Hz) were collected to analyze the penultimate foot contact and final foot contact (FFC). Pearson's or Spearman's correlations coefficients revealed performance time (PT), peak external knee abduction moment (KAM), and peak external knee rotation moment (KRM) were all significantly related (p < 0.05) to horizontal approach velocity (PT: ρ = -0.579; peak KAM: ρ = 0.414; peak KRM: R = -0.568) and FFC peak hip flexor moment (PT: ρ = 0.418; peak KAM: ρ = -0.624; peak KRM: ρ = 0.517). Performance time was also significantly (p < 0.01) associated with horizontal exit velocity (ρ = -0.451) and, notably, multiplanar knee joint loading (peak KAM: ρ = -0.590; peak KRM: ρ = 0.525; peak KFM: ρ = -0.509). Cohen's d effect sizes (d) revealed that faster performers demonstrated significantly greater (p < 0.05; d = 1.1-1.7) multiplanar knee joint loading, as well as significantly greater (p < 0.05; d = 0.9-1.2) FFC peak hip flexor moments, PFC average horizontal GRFs, and peak knee adduction angles. To conclude, mechanics associated with faster cutting performance seem to be ""at odds"" with lower multiplanar knee joint loads.

J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2019-Soccer players performing at high level are frequently exposed to periods of intense training, which can induce substantial stress and fatigue. These high-intensity stimuli are likely lead to a lower state of well-being and poor recovery and, consequently, may affect players' performance. This study aimed to assess the influence of well-being indices (i.e., self-ratings of sleep, stress, fatigue, and delayed onset muscle soreness [DOMS]) and the total quality of recovery (TQR) on technical and physiological measures during soccer small-sided games (SSGs). Twenty male professional soccer players (age: 25.1 ± 1.0 years) performed four 25-minute SSG sessions. Well-being indices were collected before each SSG-session. Heart rate was continuously measured throughout each session, and the ratings of perceived exertion and blood lactate concentration were collected after each SSG. A hierarchical cluster analysis was performed across variables and cases to identify associations between variables and variability in players' responses between sessions. No significant correlations were found between well-being indices, TQR and physiological parameters. Total quality recovery was positively correlated with successful pass % (r = 0.27) and interceptions (r = 0.25) and negatively correlated with lost balls (r = -0.25). Fatigue and DOMS were negatively correlated with tackles (r = -0.29, r = -0.28, respectively), successful pass % (r = -0.58, r = -0.55, respectively) and interceptions (r = -0.25, r = -0.27, respectively), and positively correlated with lost balls (r = 0.32, r = 0.28, respectively). Results provide an alternative and complementary method to understand training responses and can be an objective tool to help create subgroups in training for optimizing performance. This study demonstrates the efficacy and utility of using simple well-being and recovery measures to help coaches monitor athlete readiness.","2019","2020-05-20 00:27:06","2020-05-20 00:27:06",NA,"",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Medline",NA,NA,NA,"; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1519/JSC.0000000000003228; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629064975","adult; human; male; article; soccer player; exercise; heart rate; fatigue; cluster analysis; human tissue; stress; lactate blood level; wellbeing; muscle; sleep; stimulus",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of donning lower-body garments fitted with cooled phase change material (PCM) on recovery of neuromuscular function following competitive soccer match-play. Methods: Using a randomized, crossover design, 11 male semi-professional soccer players wore PCM cooled to 15°C (PCMcold) or left at ambient temperature (PCMamb; sham control) for 3 h following soccer match-play. Pre-, and 24, 48, and 72 h post-match, participants completed a battery of neuromuscular, physical, and perceptual tests. Maximal voluntary contraction force (MVC) and twitch responses to electrical (femoral nerve) and magnetic (motor cortex) stimulation (TMS) during isometric knee-extension and at rest were measured to assess central nervous system (CNS) (voluntary activation, VA) and muscle contractile (quadriceps potentiated twitch force, Qtw,pot) function. Fatigue and perceptions of muscle soreness were assessed via visual analog scales, and physical function was assessed through measures of jump [countermovement jump (CMJ) height and reactive strength index (RSI)] performance. A belief questionnaire was completed pre- and post-intervention to determine the perceived effectiveness of each garment. Results: Competitive soccer match-play elicited persistent decrements in MVC, VA measured with femoral nerve stimulation, Qtw,pot, as well as reactive strength, fatigue and muscle soreness (P < 0.05). Both MVC and VA were higher at 48 h post-match after wearing PCMcold compared with PCMamb (P < 0.05). However, there was no effect of PCM on the magnitude or time-course of recovery for any other neuromuscular, physical function, or perceptual indices studied (P > 0.05). The belief questionnaire revealed that players perceived that both PCMcold and PCMamb were moderately effective in improving recovery, with no difference between the two interventions (P = 0.56). Conclusion: Although wearing cooled PCM garments improved MVC and VA 48 h following match-play, the lack of effect on measures of physical function or perceptual responses to match-play suggest that PCM offers a limited benefit to the recovery process. The lack of effect could have been due to the relatively small magnitude of change in most of the outcome measures studied.","2019","2020-05-20 00:16:39","2020-05-20 00:16:39",NA,"",NA,"JUN","10",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Embase",NA,NA,NA,"; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2019.00647; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628533047","human; male; article; soccer; soccer player; controlled study; randomized controlled trial; muscle contraction; fatigue; muscle disease; physical examination; rest; visual analog scale; clinical effectiveness; crossover procedure; neuromuscular function; central nervous system; central nervous system function; cryotherapy device; environmental temperature; femoral nerve; maximal voluntary contraction; motor cortex; musculoskeletal system parameters; nerve stimulation; perception test; phase change material; transcranial magnetic stimulation",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Focus group interviews explored their sporting experiences with reference to body perceptions, and perceptions of their sporting bodies outside sporting contexts. Three themes resulted from data analysis, these being; (1) UK culture, body performances and femininity, (2) sporting culture, body performances and femininity and (3) transiency of body satisfaction across sport and non-sport contexts. Findings suggest that sport may not always provide an opportunity to challenge and resist dominant discourses. In both netball and soccer, a range of surveillance and management practices were used that served to perpetuate the value of a 'feminine' and assumed heterosexual body, and legitimize their sport participation through an emphasis on a hyper-femininity. The influence of sport subcultures on gendered performances and identity construction, along with implications for marketing sports participation to women are discussed.

Parents and advocacy groups are pushing for state legislation to ban youth tackle football in favor of flag football to avoid repetitive head impacts that are potentially associated with late-life cognitive deficits. Although the head impact burden experienced during flag football is likely lower than tackle, no research has compared head impact exposure between youth tackle and flag football. Therefore, our purpose was to examine head impact exposure and magnitudes between youth tackle and flag football players. Methods: Twenty-seven tackle (age=11.0±1.5y, height=145.8±11.9cm, mass=45.0±14.9kg) and 29 flag football players (age=8.6±1.1y, height=133.9±8.4cm, mass=33.9±9.5kg) were enrolled in this prospective cohort study. Participants were fitted with head impact sensors (Triax Sim-G) worn throughout the entire 2017 season that recorded impact frequency and magnitude (linear [g] and rotational acceleration [rad/s2]). Athlete exposure was defined as one player participating in one session. Impact rates (IR) were calculated as impacts per one athlete exposure. Game, practice, and combined IR were compared between groups using impact rate ratios (IRR). IRR with 95% confidence intervals (CI) not containing 1.0 were considered statistically significant. Acceleration values were binned into low- and high-magnitude categories (linear split at 40g, rotational split at 4,600rad/s2). Magnitude category frequencies were compared between groups using Chi-square test of association (p<0.05), and 90th percentile acceleration values are presented. Results: One-thousand nine-hundred and eight tackle (735 game, 1173 practice; 70.66 impacts/player) and 169 flag (101 game, 68 practice; 5.83 impacts/player) football head impacts were recorded. Tackle players experienced a higher impact rate during games versus practices (IRR=1.41; 95%CI:1.29-1.55) while flag players experienced a lower impact rate (IRR=0.60; 95%CI:0.44-0.81). Practice and game head impacts combined resulted in tackle players (IR=3.06) accruing 4.61 times the impact rate (95%CI:3.94-5.40) of flag players (IR=0.66). Tackle players sustained a significantly greater head impact rate than flag players during games (tackle IR=3.83, flag IR=0.55; IRR=6.90; 95%CI:5.60-8.49) and practices (tackle IR=2.72, flag IR=0.93; IRR=2.91; 95%CI:2.28-3.72). Tackle 90th percentile linear acceleration was 53.32g (median=32.50g) and flag was 53.32g (median=32.65g). Tackle 90th percentile rotational acceleration was 7,000 rad/s2 (median=3,200rad/s2) while flag was 8,300 rad/s2 (median=4,100rad/s2). Tackle experienced a significantly higher frequency of low-magnitude rotational acceleration impacts (71.6% vs. 57.4%) and lower frequency of high-magnitude impacts than flag (28.4% vs 42.6%; ?2=15.15, p<0.001). There were no significant associations for linear acceleration (p=0.75). Conclusions/Significance: Our results indicate youth flag football head impact rates are 82%-88% lower compared to tackle. Contrary to general belief, youth flag football players experienced numerous head impacts with a greater tendency for high-magnitude rotational acceleration head impacts. Although fewer head impacts occur during youth flag football, parents and coaches should be aware that head impacts do occur during practices and games. Whether high-magnitude or high-frequency head impacts influence long-term health remains unknown. Our findings provide novel evidence into the head impact exposure occurring during youth tackle and flag football. Longitudinal studies examining head impact biomechanics and advanced neuroimaging in youth tackle and flag football players nationwide is warranted to ensure long term cognitive health.","2019","2020-05-20 00:11:52","2020-05-20 00:11:52",NA,"",NA,"3","7",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Embase",NA,NA,NA,"; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2325967119S00001; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L627389563","adult; conference abstract; female; football player; human; human experiment; male; acceleration; biomechanics; controlled study; prospective study; season; cohort analysis; juvenile; height; longitudinal study; cognitive defect; chi square test; head; sensor; neuroimaging",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Twenty male rugby players (21.4 ± 2.1 y) completed two trials of a 2 × 23 min rugby movement simulation protocol during which the order of events was performed in a stochastic order, with 7–10 days between trials. Movement characteristics, heart rate (HR), RPE, maximum voluntary contraction (MVC), voluntary activation (VA%) of the quadriceps, Stroop test and subjective task load rating (NASA-TLX) were measured. The most reliable measures of external load was relative distance (typical error [TE] and CV% = 1.5–1.6 m min−1 and 1.4–1.5%, respectively), with all other movement characteristics possessing a CV% <5%. The most reliable measure of internal load, neuromuscular function and perceptual measures were for %HRmax (TE and CV% = 1.4–1.7% and 1.4–2.1%, respectively), MVC before (TE and CV% = 10.8–14.8 N·m and 3.8–4.6%, respectively), and average RPE (TE and CV% = 0.5–0.8 AU and 3.6–5.5%, respectively). The Stroop test, NASA-TLX and blood lactate produced the least reliable measures (CV% >5%). Future studies can confidently examine changes in several perceptual, neuromuscular, physiological and movement measures related to rugby activity using stochastic movements.

Method: Eighteen professional rugby union athletes performed a 3-week resistance training intervention where they were randomly allocated into 2 groups: HEAT (n = 8) with all lower-body training sessions performed in an environmental chamber set at 35°C and 37% relative humidity, or CON (n = 10) where identical training was performed under temperate conditions (21°C and 45%). Pre- and post-training tests included measures of strength, power, endurance, speed and body mass. Results:Small effect sizes were found in favour of HEAT for the back squat (g = 0.25) and bench press strength (g = 0.22). All other measures were associated with trivial or unclear effects. A significant group × time interaction was found for body mass, associated with a trivial effect size (g = 0.18, HEAT +1.5 kg; CON −0.8 kg). Discussion: Lower body resistance training in the heat led to small improvements in lower and upper body strength compared to the identical training program performed in temperate conditions. This observation is suggestive of a priming or potentiating effect of prior training in the heat.

The purpose of this case study was to apply a new analysis approach, so far only used for 1-versus-1 analyses in soccer, to small-sided games and to identify and analyse therewith the efficiency of tactical patterns in 3-versus-2 game play. Therefore, 279 games, performed by an elite youth soccer team, were recorded by video and a position tracking system. The data was processed by the new approach, including unsupervised machine learning routines and artificial intelligence methods. Two crucial moments were used to analyse the occurring tactical patterns for the specific game: T0 (time instant of the shot) and T1 (time instant of the last action before the shot). For both moments typical tactical patterns, considering the spatio-temporal context of the situations, were found. By combining the patterns of both moments, hidden tactical strategies were identified and their efficiencies calculated. The most significant result is that offence attempts have the highest scoring probability when played via the wings near to the goal line and the final pass, before the shot, is given against the playing direction into the centre of the field.

The sample consisted of 11,446 actions corresponding to 1325 matches from the Spanish Futsal League in the seasons from 2010 to 2015. Binary logistic regression and classification tree multivariate models were used to identify the best predictor variables related to the chance of shooting as a criterion of success. Results from the binomial logistic regression emphasised the success relationships when the teams played at home, against an equally ranked opponent, during balanced matches, and had up to two fouls. When the teams were drawing or losing, the actions of goalkeeper as an outfield player were unsuccessful. The classification tree results identified a greater chance of shooting in balanced matches during the playoffs, and with no more than two fouls. Negative effects were observed during the regular phase and when used by the teams in the final moments of a match. The identified trends will allow futsal coaches to recognise the most suitable situations for achieving success when using an attack with the goalkeeper as an outfield player.

Standard bilateral lower limb anteroposterior weight-bearing radiographs were acquired and clinical measurement of intercondylar/intermalleolar (ICD/IMD) distance was performed. Coronal plane mechanical alignment was assessed by five angles: leg mechanical axis (LMA), lateral proximal femoral angle (LPFA), lateral distal femoral angle (LDFA), medial proximal tibial angle (MPTA), and lateral distal tibial angle (LDTA). Their values were compared to the reference values for adult population. An inter-individual comparison between right/left and dominant/non-dominant leg was added. The sum of bilateral LMA was correlated against ICD/IMD and against ICD/IMD adjusted for body height.Results: Football players presented with ICD/IMD of 46.5 (19.8) mm. Two, out of five, lower leg coronal angles showed significant differences (p < 0.001) compared to reference data from literature: LMA 5.8 (3.0)º vs.1.2 (2.2)º and MPTA 83.5 (2.6)º vs. 87.2 (1.5)º. No significant differences between left/right leg and dominant/non-dominant leg were established. Summed up bilateral LMA showed a high correlation to IMD/ICD (r = 0.8395; R2 = 0.7048), and even higher to ICD/IMD adjusted for body height (r = 0.8543; R2 = 0.7298).Conclusions: This study was radiographically confirming increased varus of elite football players toward general population. Apex of the varus deformity was located in the proximal tibia. Clinical measurement of ICD/IMD adjusted for body height highly correlated with the radiographic values of coronal alignment; therefore, it may be used in population studies.","2019","2020-05-20 00:39:31","2020-05-20 00:39:31",NA,"1771-1777",NA,"12","139",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"c8h",NA,NA,NA,"","https://gateway.library.qut.edu.au/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=c8h&AN=139458422&site=ehost-live&scope=site","Adult; Football -- Physiology; Male; Scales; Questionnaires; Weight-Bearing -- Physiology; Young Adult; Knee Joint; Knee Joint -- Physiology; Bone Diseases; Reference Values",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Dependent variables were anthropometrics, work-to-rest ratio, and wet bulb globe temperature. Descriptive variables included preparticipation examination and uniform configuration. A subset of 16 players participated in physiological variables (heart rate and gastrointestinal temperature). Data collection occurred on 7 AR and 8 WR nonconsecutive practices and the first 3 games of the season. Results: Mean values for anthropometric variables were higher (p < 0.05) in the AR league than the WR league.

The recognition of key physical characteristics of such footballers who successfully progress through talent development programs is of considerable interest to academics and those working in professional football. Using Football Yearbooks, we obtained the height, body mass and ages of all players from the English top-division over the seasons 1973–4, 1983–4, 1993–4, 2003–4 and 2013–4, calculating body-mass index (BMI) (kg/m2) and reciprocal ponderal index (RPI) (cm/kg0.333). The mean squad size increased over these decades from n = 22.4 (1973–4) to n = 27.8 (2013–4). Height also increased linearly by approximately 1.2 cm per decade. Body mass increased in the first four decades, but declined in the final season (2013–4). Regression analysis confirmed inverted ""u"" shape trends in both body mass and BMI, but a ""J"" shape trend in RPI, indicating that English top-division professional footballers are getting more angular and ectomorphic. We speculate that this recent decline in BMI and rise in RPI is due to improved quality of pitches and increased work-load required by modern-day players. Defenders were also found to be significantly taller, heavier, older and, assuming BMI is positively associated with lean mass, more muscular than other midfielders or attackers. The only characteristic that consistently differentiated successful with less successful players/teams was age (being younger). Therefore, English professional clubs might be advised to attract young, less muscular, more angular/ectomorphic players as part of their talent identification and development programs to improve their chances of success.

Based on impression management theory, we analyze content posted by recruits and apply machine learning to identify instances of self-promotion and ingratiation in 5.5 million tweets. Using negative binomial regression, we discover that an athlete's level of engagement on Twitter is a positive and significant predictor of the number of offers. Also, both self-promotion and ingratiation are positively related to attracting new offers. Our results highlight the growing importance of social media as a recruiting tool and suggest that recruits' online self-presentation may have significant offline impacts.

One hundred one match performances were observed over the course of half of a season at the highest level of national competition in Croatia. Players (mean ± SD, age: 23.85 ± 2.88 years; body height: 183.05 ± 8.88 cm; body mass: 78.69 ± 7.17 kg) were classified into five playing positions (central defenders (n = 26), full-backs (n = 24), central midfielders (n = 33), wide midfielders (n = 10), and forwards (n = 8). RP, as measured by global positioning system, included the total distance covered, distance covered in five speed categories (walking, jogging, running, high-speed running, and maximal sprinting), total number of accelerations, number of high-intensity accelerations, total number of decelerations, and number of high-intensity decelerations. The GPI were collected by the position-specific performance statistics index (InStat index). The average total distance was 10,298.4 ± 928.7 m, with central defenders having the shortest and central midfielders having the greatest covered distances. The running (r = 0.419, p = 0.03) and high-intensity accelerations (r = 0.493, p = 0.01) were correlated with the InStat index for central defenders. The number of decelerations of full-backs (r = −0.43, p = 0.04) and the distance covered during sprinting of forwards (r = 0.80, p = 0.02) were associated with their GPI obtained by InStat index. The specific correlations between RP and GPI should be considered during the conditioning process in soccer. The soccer training should follow the specific requirements of the playing positions established herein, which will allow players to meet the game demands and to perform successfully.","2019","2020-05-20 00:08:02","2020-05-20 00:08:02",NA,"",NA,"20","16",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Embase Medline",NA,NA,NA,"; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph16204032; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002839360","human; article; football; soccer player; season; competition; deceleration; running; jogging; walking; body height; global positioning system; Croatia",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

C.","Incidence of game-related, high school football lower extremity and surface impact trauma requiring elective imaging and surgery across artificial turf systems of various infill Weight","Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine",NA,"2325-9671","10.1177/2325967119S00411",NA,"Objectives: Artificial turf surfaces are developed to duplicate playing characteristics of natural grass. With the newer generations of sand and rubber infill systems, infill weight is a common component that varies between fields. With the increasing concerns of rising medical costs, the potential for long-term articular changes, and perceived higher incidence of articular trauma while playing on artificial turf, infill weight could be a critical factor that could influence sport trauma and subsequent elective medical decisions. Therefore, this study quantified the incidence of game-related, high school football lower extremity and surface impact trauma requiring elective medical procedures across artificial turf systems of various infill weight. Methods: Artificial turf systems were divided into two sand/rubber infill weight groups by lbs per square foot: 6.0 to ≥9.0, and 0.0-5.9. Fifty-seven high schools participated across four states over 5 seasons. Outcomes of interest included elective medical procedures by injury category (player-turf surface impact trauma, trauma from shoe:surface interaction during physical collision/contact, trauma from shoe:surface interaction during physical noncontact). Data were subject to multivariate analyses of variance (MANOVA) and Wilks' λ criteria using general linear model procedures. Results: Of 1,837 games documented, 1,049 games were played on 6.0 to ≥9.0 lbs infill/sq. ft, and 788 on 0.0-5.9 lbs infill/sq. ft, with 4,655 total injuries reported. MANOVA indicated a significant main effect across elective medical procedures by injury category (F3,3977 = 16.574; P < .0001). Post hoc analyses indicated significantly lower injury incidence rates (IIR per 10 game season) requiring radiography and MRI procedures following player-turf surface impact trauma [1.7, (95% CI, 1.5-1.9) vs 3.2 (2.9-3.5); P = .001], trauma from shoe:surface interaction during physical collision/contact [2.4, (95% CI, 2.1-2.6) vs 3.2 (2.9-3.5); P = .001], and trauma from shoe:surface interaction during physical noncontact [0.4, (95% CI, 0.3-0.5) vs 0.7 (0.5-0.9); P = .01], while competing on the 6 to ≥9.0 lbs infill/sq. ft when compared to the lighter infill weight systems, respectively. No significant differences in surgical procedures by injury category were observed between infill weight. Conclusion: As the artificial infill surface weight decreased, the incidence of game-related, high school football lower extremity and surface impact trauma, and subsequent elective medical procedures significantly increased. Based on findings, high school football fields should minimally contain 6.0 to ≥9.0 lbs infill/sq. ft. This is the first longitudinal study to investigate the influence of artificial infill weight influence on high school sport trauma and elective medical decisions.","2019","2020-05-20 00:26:21","2020-05-20 00:26:21",NA,"",NA,"7","7",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Embase",NA,NA,NA,"; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2325967119S00411; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629238934","conference abstract; human; football; sport injury; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; controlled study; incidence; season; high school; longitudinal study; surgical technique; post hoc analysis; body weight loss; foot; multivariate analysis of variance; joint injury; radiography; rubber",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0
