Purpose: To report the injury incidence rate (IIR), severity, and burden of injuries sustained by men and women in the Australian rugby sevens program and to provide the first longitudinal investigation of subsequent injury occurrence in rugby sevens looking beyond tournament injuries only. Study Design: Descriptive epidemiology study. Methods: Ninety international rugby sevens players (55 men and 35 women) were prospectively followed over 2 consecutive seasons (2015-2016 and 2016-2017). All medical attention injuries were reported irrespective of time loss. Individual exposure in terms of minutes, distance, and high-speed distance was captured for each player for matches and on-field training, with the use of global positioning system devices. The IIR and injury burden (IIR × days lost to injury) were calculated per 1000 player-hours, and descriptive analyses were performed. Results: Seventy-three players (81.1%) sustained 365 injuries at an IIR of 43.2 per 1000 player-hours (95% CI, 43.0-43.3). As compared with male players, female players experienced a lower IIR (incidence rate ratio, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.90-0.91). Female players also sustained a higher proportion of injuries to the trunk region (relative risk, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.28-2.40) but a lower number to the head/neck region (relative risk, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.37-0.93; P =.011). The majority (80.7%) of subsequent injuries were of a different site and nature than previous injuries. A trend toward a reduced number of days, participation time, distance, and high-speed distance completed before the next injury was observed after successive injury occurrence. Conclusion: Female players have a lower IIR than male players, with variation of injury profiles observed between sexes. With a surveillance period of 2 years, subsequent injuries account for the majority of injuries sustained in rugby sevens, and they are typically different from previous types of sustained injuries. After each successive injury, the risk profile for future injury occurrence appears to be altered, which warrants further investigation to inform injury prevention strategies in rugby sevens.

In order to respond to the requirements of international health, this paper takes football as the foundation, joins the technical theory, and provides the theoretical basis for healthy football training. Methods: Based on taking the ball actions in the football training subject, a real-time multi-person pose estimation model in the paper is presented. The top-down frame model mainly includes four parts: human body detection, STM model and SDTM model, pose estimation model and pose back propagation model, and pose non-maximum suppression model. The pose with the highest confidence is selected as a reference, and then the elimination principle is redefined to remove the area box near the area. Results: Through experimental comparison, the various components of football players' movements are analyzed. Compared with the Kalman method and the Fourier method, the reconstruction results of the proposed method are the closest to the actual results. Conclusions: The accuracy of the research method in the measurement of pose parameters of 3D moving images is verified, which provides technical support for human body pose control and adjustment in sports.","2019","2020-05-20 00:07:03","2020-05-20 00:07:03","","19-20","","","125","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L631581944","adult; back propagation; conference abstract; female; football player; human; human experiment; male; public health; theoretical study","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With increasing concerns for player welfare, the decision to return to play after sustaining an on-field injury is complex. Aim: Review of a 5-year experience of a pitch side radiology unit (PSRU) at a large international sports stadium. Methods: X-rays were acquired in a purpose built pitch side radiology unit (PSRU) within a large international sports stadium (Aviva Stadium) using a mobile digital X-ray unit. All x-rays were performed at the Aviva stadium’s PSRU from October 2012 to March 2018. Results: From October 2012 to March 2018, 89 competitive sport matches were held at the international sports stadium. 43/89 (48%) matches required the PSRU, with rugby matches having the highest utilization rates (34/47, 72.3%). In 89 matches, a total of 79 x-rays were performed (0.89 x-rays/match). The highest percentage of sports players undergoing imaging was rugby players (70/79, 88.6%). Overall, the majority of x-rays were of the upper limbs (49/79, 62.0%) and lower limbs (25/79, 31.6%). 17/79 (21.5%) x-rays demonstrated an acute bony injury, 15/17 (88%) of which were rugby players. Conclusion: The PSRU at the Aviva international sports stadium is well utilized and allows for a rapid diagnosis of osseous injuries sustained on the field of play. It provides a useful adjunct to the pitch side clinical assessment by medical staff. It provides a privacy and strategic advantage to players compared with hospital-based services. Consideration should be given to installing similar PSRUs at major sports stadiums around the world.","2019","2020-05-20 00:07:04","2020-05-20 00:07:04","","1391-1395","","4","188","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L627323973; http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11845-019-02013-8","human; article; bone injury; bone radiography; distal radius fracture; elite athlete; football; lower limb; metacarpal bone fracture; phalanx fracture; proximal humerus fracture; rib fracture; rugby; soccer; soccer player; sport injury; tibia fracture; upper limb","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Better known as Tardelli's scream, it is thus a perfect object to analyse in order to understand football's deeper social meanings and its political and cultural undertones, in this case both for the World Cup champions, Italy, and for the host country, Spain. In the Spanish case, organizing the World Cup was a huge political opportunity for the just restored democracy to showcase to the world a modern and pluralistic society leaving behind the authoritarian and outdated dictatorship. As for Italy, their first World Cup winning since World War II was heavily politically used by actors across the political spectrum. Such nationalistic approach constituted a novelty after decades of a low profile national discourse.

The ability of dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) to estimate VAT in athletic populations compared to the criterion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was also explored. Methods: Thirty elite male rugby union athletes (age 23.9 ± 4.0 years; stature 186.7 ± 7.0 cm; mass 101.9 ± 11.2 kg) underwent assessment via DXA for body composition, and MRI for abdominal adiposity, at the start of the pre-season training period. Participants were ascribed a specific ethnicity when three or more of their grandparents were of either Caucasian or Polynesian descent. Results: MRI VAT did not differ between ethnicities (Caucasian 92.7 ± 26.7 cm2; Polynesian 86 ± 27.3 cm2; p = 0.52); however, there was a trend for forwards (96.7 ± 25.0 cm2) to have higher VAT than backs (81.7 ± 27.3 cm2; p = 0.13) which provides an area of interest for researchers. Thirty-seven percent of athletes (eight forwards, three backs) were found to have VAT > 100 cm2, a threshold for increased cardiometabolic risk within the general population. Bland–Altman analysis indicated that DXA VAT underestimated MRI VAT by ~ 25 cm2, with relatively wide limits of agreement (− 24.0 to 75.6 cm2). Conclusions: Given the size of rugby union athletes, and the association between elevated VAT and cardiometabolic complications in ""supersized"" athletes from other sports, further investigation into VAT and other markers of cardiometabolic disease in rugby union populations is warranted. Further, DXA was found to underestimate VAT compared to the criterion MRI in this athletic population.

The biomechanical parameters differentiating these 2 distinct signs of injury are poorly described. OBJECTIVE: To differentiate between cases of concussions with LOC and those with impact seizures by comparing the impact velocity, peak linear and peak rotational acceleration, as well as brain tissue deformation in the cerebral cortex, white matter, brainstem, cerebellum, thalamus, and corpus callosum. DESIGN: Descriptive laboratory study. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: Elite American football players who sustained an LOC (n = 20) or impact seizures (n = 21). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Impact velocity, peak linear and peak rotational acceleration, maximum principal strain, cumulative strain damage measure at 10%, and strain rate (SR). RESULTS: The SR in the cerebral white matter was greater in the LOC group than in the impact-seizure group. Similar trends were observed for SRs in the cerebral cortex, brainstem, and corpus callosum. No differences were present between groups for the other variables in this study. CONCLUSIONS: A lower SR in certain brain regions helps to explain why motor function is preserved and can be observed in patients with impact seizures versus LOC from concussive injuries.","2019","2020-05-20 00:07:06","2020-05-20 00:07:06","","765-771","","7","54","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.4085/1062-6050-253-18; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628900687","human; male; football; injury; pathophysiology; acceleration; biomechanics; brain; brain concussion; traumatic epilepsy; unconsciousness","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

F.","Absolute and Relative Load and Injury in Elite Junior Australian Football Players Over 1 Season","International journal of sports physiology and performance","","1555-0273","10.1123/ijspp.2019-0100","","PURPOSE: To investigate the association between training and match loads and injury in elite junior Australian football players over 1 competitive season. METHODS: Elite junior Australian football players (n = 290, age 17.7 [0.3] y, range 16-18 y) were recruited from the under-18 state league competition in Victoria to report load and injury information. One-week load (session rating of perceived exertion multiplied by duration) and all time-loss injuries were reported using an online sport-injury surveillance system. Absolute load measures (weekly sums) enabled the calculation of relative measures such as the acute:chronic workload ratio. Load measures were modeled against injury outcome (yes/no) using a generalized estimating equation approach, with a 1-wk lag for injury. RESULTS: Low (<300 arbitrary units [au]) and high (>4650 au) 1-wk loads were associated with significantly higher risk of injury. Furthermore, low (<100 au) and high (>850 au) session loads were associated with a higher risk of injury. High strain values (>13,000) were associated with up to a 5-fold increase in the odds of injury. There was a relatively flat-line association between the acute:chronic workload ratio and injury. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first investigation of elite junior athletes demonstrating linear and nonlinear relationships between absolute and relative load measures and injury. Coaches should focus player loads on, or at least close to, the point at which injury risk starts to increase again (2214 au for 1-wk load and 458 au for session load) and use evidence-based strategies across the week and month to help reduce the risk of injury.","2019","2020-05-20 00:07:08","2020-05-20 00:07:08","","1-9","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1123/ijspp.2019-0100; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629471699","football player; human; article; sport injury; exercise; calculation; controlled study; incidence; major clinical study; prospective study; season; team sport; workload","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An understanding of the return-to-play times is an integral part of clinical decision making when treating professional athletes. A period of 8 to 12 weeks has been conventionally recommended for returning to collision sports after facial fractures. The conventional time to return to sports of 8 to 12 weeks is usually too long for professional players. However, the time of return to play after such facial fractures in elite athletes has not been well described. PURPOSE: To investigate the return to play after facial fractures in professional rugby players with an accelerated rehabilitation protocol. METHODS: Ten professional rugby players with facial fractures were identified and analyzed. The authors investigated the number of days required to return to training and full-contact play according to the trauma type. The authors also determined the presence or absence of refractures and sequelae. RESULTS: The average age of the patients was 26.9 years. Medial orbital wall fractures were the most represented pattern, followed by orbital floor fractures and zygomatic arch fractures. The players returned to jogging after 9.9 days, to sports-specific training after a mean of 10.8 days, and to full-contact training after 18.3 days. There were no cases of refractures and sequelae. CONCLUSION: Players were able to return to their regular rugby activities, earlier than the time commonly allowed to return to full activity.","2019","2020-05-20 00:07:09","2020-05-20 00:07:09","","1121-1124","","4","30","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628169580; http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/SCS.0000000000005138","adult; human; football; facial bone; injuries; return to sport; skull fracture; statistics and numerical data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Materials and methods: Sixty-four players were screened during the preseason period with non-contact injuries and exposure time recorded prospectively for the entirety of three consecutive seasons (2014/15, 2015/16 and 2016/17). One-hundred and eighteen player-season observations were included in the analysis. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) were utilized to explore associations between FMS™ composite, individual sub-test scores, the number of sub-test asymmetries and non-contact injury. Results: The FMS™ composite score demonstrated a likely trivial (IRR: 1.05 95%CI: 0.94–1.17) association with non-contact injury. The number of individual sub-test asymmetries and all of the sub-test scores (with the exception of the hurdle step, IRR: 1.58 95%CI: 0.99–2.52) demonstrated unclear associations with non-contact injury. Conclusions: No associations with non-contact injury were observed for the FMS™ composite score, individual sub-test scores or the number of sub-test asymmetries, even when accounting for exposure and multiple injuries to the same player. Practical implications: The FMS™ composite score is likely not useful for injury risk stratification, nor are the individual sub-tests or the number of asymmetries.

We have previously shown that even though concussive biomechanics might be unremarkable in large datasets of head impacts, the impacts causing injury are of high magnitude for the concussed individuals relative to their impact history. This finding suggests a need to account for differences in tolerance at the individual level. In this study, we identified control subjects for our concussed subjects who demonstrated traits we believed were correlated to factors thought to affect injury tolerance, including height, mass, age, race, and concussion history. A total of 502 college football players were instrumented with helmet-mounted accelerometer arrays and provided complete baseline assessment data, 44 of which sustained a total of 49 concussion. Biomechanical measures quantifying impact frequency and acceleration magnitude were compared between groups. On average, we found that concussed subjects experienced 93.8 more head impacts (p = 0.0031), 10.2 more high magnitude impacts (p = 0.0157), and 1.9 × greater risk-weighted exposure (p = 0.0175) than their physically matched controls. This finding provides further evidence that head impact data need to be considered at the individual level and that cohort wide assessments may be of little value in the context of concussion.","2019","2020-05-20 00:07:11","2020-05-20 00:07:11","","2048-2056","","10","47","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002346589; http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10439-019-02329-7","adult; female; human; male; article; acceleration; biomechanics; priority journal; controlled study; major clinical study; accelerometry; adolescent; analysis of variance; athlete; body mass; cohort analysis; concussion; disease severity; exploratory factor analysis; helmet; injury tolerance; physical tolerance; young adult","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Method: The study included 21 players (mean age 33.0 ± 5.4, 86% male) with posttraumatic tetraplegia. ECG, echocardiography, and gas exchange analysis during rest and exercise were used to obtain heart rate (HR), stroke volume (SV), and cardiac output (CO) for comparison with PhysioFlow®. Results: There was a good correlation between reference methods and ICG for HR, SV, CO at rest and CO at peak exercise (r = 0.69-0.77, p < .001) and a very good correlation for peak HR (r = 0.91, p < .0001). ICG overestimated SV at rest, CO at rest, and peak CO, which resulted in low intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC = 0.250 and 0.570). Conclusions: ICG can serve as a good estimate of basic hemodynamic parameters during rest and exercise in wheelchair rugby players but overestimates stroke volume and cardiac output.","2019","2020-05-20 00:07:12","2020-05-20 00:07:12","","336-343","","3","90","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","","","","https://gateway.library.qut.edu.au/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=c8h&AN=138105915&site=ehost-live&scope=site","Adult; Cardiac Output -- Physiology; Cardiography, Impedance; Clinical Assessment Tools; Echocardiography; Electrocardiography; Exercise of Self-Care Agency Scale; Exercise Test; Female; Football -- Physiology; Heart Rate -- Physiology; Hemodynamics -- Physiology; Male; Pulmonary Gas Exchange -- Physiology; Quadriplegia -- Physiopathology; Relaxation; Scales; Sports, Disabled -- Physiology; Stroke Volume -- Physiology; Wheelchairs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, the aim of our study was to assess anaerobic and aerobic performance indicators of young female soccer players with different ACE/ACTN3 gene profiles. Methods: Twenty-seven female soccer players aged 16-18 underwent acceleration, speed, strength, anaerobic power and aerobic endurance tests and had their ACE and ACTN3 polymorphisms determined. Results: Based on genetic analysis, they were divided into the following groups: ACE II (n=2), ACE ID (n=11), ACE DD (n=14), ACTN3 XX (n=5), ACTN3 RR (n=7) and ACTN3 RX (n=15). ACE DD and ACE ID groups differed significantly in terms of results achieved on the 5 m sprint test (1.15±0.05 s vs 1.10±0.05 s, P=0.42). ACTN3 RR and RX achieved better results than the ACTN3 XX group in seven continuous vertical jumps (26.57±1.59 cm vs 25.77±2.51 cm vs 22.86±1.16 cm, respectively; P=0.007 for RR vs XX and P=0.021 for RX vs XX). Conclusion: High prevalence of ACE DD and ACTN3 RX genotypes in our subjects may suggest that faster and more powerful young females tend to perform better in soccer. Nevertheless, the absence of differences in most of the physical test results indicates that different genotypes are compatible with high-level soccer performance, meaning that it is the phenotype-genotype interaction that makes a successful female soccer player.

ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR Objetivo: Estudios anteriores mostraron relaciones controvertidas entre los polimorfismos de los genes ACE y ACTN3 y desempeño deportivo. Siendo así, el objetivo de este estudio fue evaluar los indicadores de desempeño anaeróbico y aeróbico de jóvenes futbolistas del sexo femenino con diferentes perfiles de los genes ACE/ACTN3. Métodos: Veintisiete jugadoras con edad entre 16 y 18 años realizaron tests de aceleración, velocidad, fuerza, potencia anaeróbica y resistencia aeróbica y fueron determinados los polimorfismos de sus genes ACE e ACTN3. Resultados: Con base en el análisis genético, ellas fueron divididas en los siguientes grupos: ACE II (n = 2), ACE ID (n = 11), ACE DD (n = 14), ACTN3 XX (n = 5), ACTN3 RR (n = 7) y ACTN3 RX (n = 15). Los grupos ACE DD y ACE ID difirieron significativamente cuanto a los resultados obtenidos en el sprint test de 5 metros (1,15 ± 0,05 s vs. 1,10 ± 0,05 s, P = 0,42). Los grupos ACTN3 RR y RX alcanzaron resultados mejores que el grupo ACTN3 XX en siete saltos verticales continuos (26,57 ± 1,59 cm vs. 25,77 ± 2,51 cm vs. 22,86 ± 1,16 cm, respectivamente; P = 0,007 para RR vs. XX y P = 0,021 para RX vs. XX). Conclusión: La alta prevalencia de genotipos RX en ACE DD y ACTN3 en nuestra muestra puede sugerir que las jóvenes atletas más rápidas y con mayor potencia tienden a tener mejor desempeño en el fútbol. Sin embargo, la ausencia de diferencia en la mayoría de los resultados de los tests físicos indica que genotipos distintos son compatibles con el desempeño futbolístico de alto nivel, lo que significa que es la interacción fenotipo-genotipo que hace que una jugadora de fútbol sea exitosa.

The maximum knee valgus angle (KVA) and minimum knee flexion angle (KFA) have been identified as risk factors for non-contact anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. The present study investigated whether a recent history of lower limb injury in professional male football players can affect KVA and KFA during a single-leg vertical drop-jump (SLVDJ). Methods. Twenty-one professional male football players performed a SLVDJ. The participants were divided into two groups depending on the history of a lower limb injury within the previous 12 months. Two-dimensional video analysis was used to investigate maximum KVA and minimum KFA using Kinovea software. Results. There were statistically significant differences between the injured and uninjured football players during the jump with the least ground contact time in KVA (t = 2.123, df = 19, p = 0.047) and KFA (t = 2.530, df = 19, p = 0.020), and in the mean KVA (t = 2.359, df = 19, p = 0.029) and KFA (t = 2.157, df = 19, p = 0.044). Conclusion. Football players who sustained a lower limb injury within the previous 12 months landed with increased KVA and decreased KFA at initial contact as compared to players without history of lower limb injury within the last 12 months.","2019","2020-05-20 00:07:13","2020-05-20 00:07:13","","70-75","","1","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","","","","https://gateway.library.qut.edu.au/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=c8h&AN=142800997&site=ehost-live&scope=site","Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries -- Risk Factors; Athletes, Professional; Biomechanics; Body Weights and Measures; Confidence Intervals; Data Analysis Software; Flexion; Football; Human; Jumping; Lower Extremity -- Injuries; Prospective Studies; Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient; T-Tests","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of subsequent ligament disruption for high school and college-aged athletes between autograft BTB versus hamstring grafts for ACLRs. Our hypothesis is there would be no recurrent ligament failure differences between autograft types at 6-year follow-up. Methods: Our inclusion criteria were patients aged 14-22 who were injured in sport (basketball, football, soccer, other), had a contralateral normal knee, and were due to have a unilateral primary ACLR with either a BTB or hamstring autograft. All patients were prospectively followed at two and six years and contacted by phone and/or email to determine whether any subsequent surgery had occurred to either knee since their initial ACLR. If so, operative reports were obtained, whenever possible, in order to document pathology and treatment. Multivariable regression modeling controlled for age, gender, ethnicity/race, body mass index, sport and competition level, activity level, knee laxity, and graft type. The six-year outcomes of interest were the incidence of subsequent ACL reconstruction to either knee. Results: Eight hundred thirty-nine (839) patients were eligible, of which 770 (92%) had 6-year follow-up for subsequent surgery outcomes. The median age was 17, with 48% females, and the distribution of BTB to hamstring was 492 (64%) and 278 (36%) respectively. Thirty-three percent (33%) of the cohort was classified as having “high grade” knee laxity preoperatively. The overall ACL revision rate was 9.2% in the ipsilateral knee, 11.2% in the contralateral normal ACL, and 19.7% had one or the other within 6 years of the index ACLR surgery. High-grade laxity (OR: 2.4; 95% CI: 1.4, 3.9; p=0.001), autograft type (OR: 2.1; 95% CI: 1.3, 3.5; p=0.004), and age (OR: 0.8; 95% CI: 0.7, 0.96; p=0.009) were the 3 most influential predictors of a recurrent ACL graft revision on the ipsilateral knee, respectively, whereas the sport of the index injury (OR: 0.3; 95% CI: 0.2, 0.7; p=0.002) was the most influential predictor of a subsequent primary ACL reconstruction on the contralateral knee. The odds of a recurrent ACL graft revision on the ipsilateral knee for patients receiving a hamstring autograft were 2.1 times the odds of a patient receiving a BTB autograft (95% CI: 1.3, 3.5). For low-risk patients (5% incidence of graft failure), a hamstring graft can increase the risk of recurrent ACL graft revision by 5 percentage points, from 5% to 10%. For high-risk patients (35% incidence of graft failure), a hamstring graft can increase the risk of recurrent ACL graft revision by 15 percentage points, from 35% to ∼ 50%. An individual prediction risk calculator for a subsequent ACL graft revision can be determined by the nomogram in Figure 1. Conclusion: There is a high rate of subsequent ACL tears in both the ipsilateral and contralateral knees in this young athletic cohort, with evidence suggesting that incidence of ACL graft revisions at 6 years following index surgery is significantly higher in hamstring autograft compared to BTB autograft.","2019","2020-05-20 00:07:14","2020-05-20 00:07:14","","","","7","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2325967119S00282; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629239263","adult; conference abstract; female; human; male; football; soccer; hamstring muscle; basketball; controlled study; incidence; prospective study; competition; adolescent; athlete; body mass; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; bone graft; e-mail; ethnicity; follow up; gender; graft failure; high risk patient; high school; low risk patient; nomogram; patellar ligament; prediction; preoperative evaluation; race; risk assessment; treatment failure","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: Twenty-one female players from the Brazilian National Soccer Team were monitored in twenty-two on-field training sessions during the 30-day preparatory training camp prior to the 2016 Olympic Games. Activities were categorized into warmup (WU), small sided games (SSG), technical and tactical training (TTT) and friendly matches (FM). The activity profile in each type of drill was then compared to the ones of the 6 matches performed during the Rio 2016 Olympic Games. Results: It was found that distance traveled at different speeds were higher during matches compared to WU, SSG, and TTT, but not compared to FM. Frequency of accelerations was similar between matches and TTT, SSG and FM. Repeated acceleration and sprints were higher during Matches compared to WU, TTT, SSG but FM presented similar results. Conclusion: It was concluded that although there were different acceleration and deceleration demands amongst WU, SSG and TTT compared to match-play, FM was the only training activity which consistently replicated or exceeded Olympic matches' physical demands.

Global positioning system (GPS) data was recorded from 36 players from 3 teams across 5 games. The relative distance covered in locomotor activities, peak speed, relative PlayerLoad? (PL.min-1) and heart rate responses were evaluated between playing positions and across match periods using a mixed model analysis. The mean relative distance of 92.4 ± 23.3 m.min-1 covered, comprised 28.4 ± 10.2 m.min-1 of high intensity running (m.min-1 = 4.0 m.s-1) and 9.9 ± 3.9 m.min-1 of very high intensity running (m.min-1 = 5.5 m.s-1). High intensity running and relative PlayerLoad? (PL.min-1) was significantly higher in half-backs, midfielders and half-forwards compared to the full-backs, whereas only the half-backs and half-forwards displayed significantly greater values compared to full-forwards. When compared to the first 15 min (P1) of the game, analysis of pooled positional data revealed significant declines in; overall relative distance covered, jogging (=2.0 - < 4.0 m.s-1), running (=4.0 - <5.5 m.s-1), high intensity running and PL.min-1,in P2 (20-35 min) and P4 (55-70 min). Significant reductions in average heart rate were also found between the first and second halves and between P1 with both P3 and P4. These results highlight differences in the physical performance requirements of specific positions and provide evidence of reductions in work-rate during games. Coaches can use this information to inform the development of both team and position-specific conditioning programmes.

External match load of 14 U17, 14 U20, and 17 senior female soccer players competing in 6-7 full official international matches were assessed using global positioning systems. Total distance covered, distance covered in high intensity (15.6-20 km·h), distance covered in sprints (sprint: >20 km·h), number of accelerations (Acc) >1 m·s, decelerations (Dec) >-1 m·s, and Player Load generally increased across the age brackets (U17 <U20 <senior). For all playing positions, senior athletes presented greater total distance, accelerations, and decelerations than U20 players. For high-intensity distance and sprints, only central defender and midfielder senior players presented greater values than U20 players. Senior players demonstrated higher values in all locomotor activities in comparison to U17 players, irrespective of playing positions. Except for central defenders who presented similar total distance, sprint distance, and number of accelerations between U20 and U17, most match external loads evaluated in all playing positions were greater in U20 than in U17 players. These results provide useful information for player development and should be used to establish appropriate match-specific conditioning drills according to age categories.","2019","2020-05-20 00:07:16","2020-05-20 00:07:16","","3414-3422","","12","33","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1519/JSC.0000000000002170; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629955047","adult; female; human; soccer; acceleration; exercise; adolescent; young adult; Brazil; deceleration; geographic information system; physiology; running","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Three hundred thirty-five elite-level players and referees were analyzed for distance covered during 20 matches of nationally held 2016 Korean league competitions. Distance covered by the players and referees was analyzed for the activity zones (slow walking, walking, jogging, running, high-intensity running, and sprinting) and 15-minute match periods. Mean distance between foul play and referee locations, foul plays, and 15-minute match periods were compared with the foul decision errors. Foul play and decision error rates (%) were also analyzed per segmented pitch zone. Although the total distance covered during a match and distances covered by jogging, running, and sprinting were significantly different between the players and referees, differences were within 1%. Significant differences in the distance covered before and after halftime were observed. The greatest distance between the foul play and referee locations, number of foul plays, and number of foul decision errors were observed at the 75-minute match period. Finally, the greater number of foul plays was observed in the neutral and attacking zones, and the foul decision errors were observed in the right defensive and left attacking zones 1. In conclusion, although the activity profiles may be different, referees should maintain certain level of physical fitness to match that of the players. To reduce the number of foul decision errors, factors such as match time, foul occurring location, and distance between foul play and referee locations should be considered.","2019","2020-05-20 00:07:17","2020-05-20 00:07:17","","2530-2540","","9","33","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1519/JSC.0000000000003083; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L627504640","adult; human; soccer; young adult; physiology; running; jogging; walking; decision making; psychology; South Korea","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This survey was undertaken to determine the effects of acute beetroot juice consumption on certain hematological parameters, lipid profiles, and total antioxidant capacity in female soccer players. Materials and Methods: This was an applied, semi-experimental study. Female soccer players (n = 30, age = 23.16 ± 0.79 years) were selected randomly and assigned into three groups: Experimental (beetroot juice, n = 10), (control (placebo), n = 10) and (mouth rinsing, n = 10). Subjects undertook soccer training for a session (90 min) with consumption of 200 ml juice 2 h before they started. Blood samples were collected and investigated before and after training. Paired sample t-tests were used for comparison within groups, and one-way ANOVA was used for comparison between groups. All statistical analyses were performed at P ≤ 0.05. Results: After a session of using beetroot juice, there were no significant differences in blood indices (levels of hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cells, iron, and mean corpuscular volume), lipid profiles (triglycerides, total cholesterol, and high density lipoprotein), and total antioxidant capacity between groups (experimental, control, and mouth rinsing) (P > 0.05), but low density lipoprotein concentrations changed significantly (P < 0.0001). Conclusions: Drinking a dose of beetroot juice did not improve hematological parameters, lipid profiles, and total antioxidant capacity. Therefore, our study of daily consumption of this drink will be pointed out to subsequent researchers.","2019","2020-05-20 00:07:18","2020-05-20 00:07:18","","42-50","","1","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629658130","adult; female; human; human experiment; article; soccer player; controlled study; young adult; antioxidant assay; beetroot juice; blood sampling; cholesterol; cholesterol blood level; erythrocyte; food intake; hematocrit; hematological parameters; hemoglobin; hemoglobin blood level; high density lipoprotein; iron; lipid; lipid fingerprinting; low density lipoprotein; mean corpuscular volume; mouth hygiene; total antioxidant capacity; triacylglycerol","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design: A retrospective cohort design study. Setting: Data were collected on the field of play or in the athletic training room after a concussive event and recorded via an electronic record, SportsWareOnLine (SWOL). Participants (or Animals, Specimens, Cadavers): Subjects included 38 participants (23 male and 15 female).The participants’ ages range from 14 to 18 years and were comprised of diverse ethnic groups. All participants were soccer players at the varsity and junior varsity levels. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measure(s): The main outcome measure was based on subject responses to a concussion symtpom self-rating scale from the Sport Concussion Assessment Tool (SCAT). Results: The findings of this study are significant in that they describe gender differences in concussion symptoms in high school soccer players as reported via a self-rated symptom questionnaire. The two populations are not the same in terms of perceived concussive injuries including number, type, (cognitive, behavioral or somatosensory), and severity of symptoms with female reporting higher numbers for each symptom type in comparison to males. The results of a Kruskal Wallis H test revealed that female players reported more severe behavioral and somatosensory symptoms; no significant difference in severity of cognitive symptoms was found. Symptom correlations using Spearman's rho analysis revealed for most symptoms, females had increased number of symptom correlations.

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine whether sleep duration is an independent predictor of in-season injury in female youth soccer players. Methods: Adolescent female soccer players (13-18 years) from a single club were monitored for 2 years of formal competition (96 weeks). Participants recorded prior night sleep duration every morning, training load (session-rating of perceived exertion), and time-loss injuries throughout the study period. Data were aggregated weekly and 2, 3, and 4 week rolling averages were calculated as well as an acute:chronic ratio (A:C; weekly divided by 4 week) for both sleep and training load. Separate multivariable Poisson regression models were used to predict the number of weekly injuries throughout the study period using 1, 2, 3, and 4 week sleep averages and A:C sleep ratio from the preceding week, while adjusting for training load over the same time frame as a covariate. Results: 97 injuries were recorded during the study period. Average sleep during the study period was 7.93 ± 0.7 hours. After controlling for training load, weekly injuries were not significantly predicted by the preceding 1 week (OR=1.10 [0.51-2.3], p=0.81), 2 week (OR=1.05 [0.41-2.6], p=0.91), 3 week (OR=1.30 [0.41-4.0], p=0.65), or 4 week (OR=1.51 [0.40-5.6], p=0.54) sleep duration. However, decreased A:C sleep ratio was a significant predictor of increased injury the following week (OR=0.77 [0.59-0.98], p=0.043). Conclusion: After controlling for training load, decreased weekly sleep duration relative to the prior month is a significant, independent predictor of increased injuries the following week. This suggests that relative sleep restriction may offer a more sensitive predictor of injury risk than acute or chronic sleep duration alone. Monitoring of sleep duration may allow for individualized intervention to reduce the risk of injuries in adolescent female athletes.","2019","2020-05-20 00:07:20","2020-05-20 00:07:20","","","","2","144","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1542/peds.144.2-MeetingAbstract.192; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L630632264","adult; conference abstract; female; human; soccer player; injury; exercise; controlled study; major clinical study; prospective study; season; competition; adolescent; juvenile; night sleep; sleep time","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Such effects seem to be related to several factors which requires researchers to verify such influences in terms of each specific context. As indoor soccer requires a mix of physical capacities, we studied the influence of static stretching in indoor football players. This manuscript addressed the acute effects of static stretching exercises (SSE) on muscle power and agility of 10 to 14-year-olds children practicing indoor soccer. This study is a randomized controlled clinical trial. Forty-six children, participant of a futsal training program, performed pre- and post-tests on horizontal jumping - measuring muscle power - and the shuttle run test - measuring agility - separated by no exercise (control group, CG) or SSE (experimental group - GE). The results pointed out a detrimental effect on the horizontal jumping but not on the shuttle run test - which showed a slight improvement. Considering the effect on the shuttle run to be a familiarization effect, we then observed effects of stretching on muscle power but not agility. As our sample is composed of trained individuals - and following similar results in the literature - we discussed these results in terms behavioral mechanisms that avoid detrimental effects of SSE provided training. SSE is detrimental to muscle power but not to agility in young trained individuals of indoor soccer. These results were interpreted in terms of potential mechanisms that training afford to individuals. Namely, compensatory behavioral strategies to maintain performance.

The aim of this study will be to understand the effects of combined preconditioning strategies on performance. Materials and methods: The following PConSt were combined: morning resistance exercise (MRE), active warm-up (AW-U), hormonal preconditioning (HP), post-activation potentiation (PAP) and ischemic preconditioning (IPC). Seventeen recreational active male (age: 24.45 ± 3.55 years, height: 181.26 ± 5.76 cm, body weight: 79.82± 2.33 kg) volunteered for this study. The Wingate anaerobic power and capacity test (WAnT) was used to determine anaerobic performance. All participants were randomly assigned to pre-test, PConSt and Sham interventions. For the PConSt group, MRE, IP, AW-U, HP and PAP were implemented sequentially before the WAnT. No effect strategies were used for the Sham intervention. Results: The findings indicated significant increases in anaerobic performance after combined training in the Peak Power (PP) and Performance Decrement (p < 0.05). A percentage change of 18.11% was found in the PP values obtained after PConSt and Sham interventions, and an increase of 9.55% was observed when the percentage increase from the sham intervention was removed in order to eliminate the psychological effect. Conclusion: It was found that a combined preconditioning strategy intervention increases anaerobic performance.","2019","2020-05-20 00:07:21","2020-05-20 00:07:21","","1251-1255","","3","35","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.19193/0393-6384_2019_3_191; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002000281","adult; human; human experiment; male; article; soccer player; controlled study; young adult; body weight; height; ischemic preconditioning; muscle training; randomized controlled trial; resistance training; warm up","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Acute effect of eccentric overload exercises on change of direction performance and lower-limb muscle contractile function. J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2019-This study aimed to evaluate the postactivation potentiation (PAP) effects following eccentric overload (EOL) exercises on change of direction (COD) performance and muscle contractile function. Thirty-one male soccer players (age 21 ± 4 years; body mass 77.0 ± 5.2 kg) were involved in a cross-sectional study. Dominant-leg (COD-5mD) and non-dominant-leg (COD-5mND) shuttle tests were performed 4 minutes after the EOL exercises. Muscle contractile function was assessed by tensiomyography (TMG) such as muscle contraction time (Tc), time delay (Td) and displacement of the muscle belly (Dm) of vastus lateralis (VL), vastus medialis (VM), and rectus femoris (RF). Eccentric overload exercises were: (a) cross-cutting step with inertial conical pulley (INC = 11 subjects), (b) flywheel leg extension (EXT = 10 subjects), and flywheel yo-yo squat exercise (SQU = 10 subjects). Differences baseline-post were found on COD-5mD (p < 0.001) and on COD-5mND (p < 0.001), but not between groups (p > 0.05) following EOL exercises. Differences from baseline were found in VL Td (p < 0.001), VM Td (p = 0.003), RF Tc (p < 0.001), and RF Td (p < 0.001) with no significant differences between the EOL exercises. This study reported a significant positive PAP response on COD-5mD and COD-5mND after 4 minutes of recovery after EOL exercises (INC, EXT and SQU) in soccer players. For the first time, it has been reported that EOL exercises acutely affect TMG variables (e.g., Tc and Td) in lower limbs. Such results related to changes in muscular contractile functions may contribute to explain the physiological mechanisms (e.g., neuromuscular factors) associated with PAP effect.","2019","2020-05-20 00:07:21","2020-05-20 00:07:21","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1519/JSC.0000000000003359; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629229066","adult; human; human experiment; male; article; soccer player; clinical article; young adult; cross-sectional study; muscle contraction; muscle function; rectus femoris muscle; vastus lateralis muscle; vastus medialis muscle","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our aim was to investigate whether semi-elite rugby union athletes may benefit. In a randomized block design, 17 semi-elite male rugby players were assigned to receive either 1 g oral NAC (n = 8) or placebo (n = 9) for six days. The mean percentage effect of NAC on exercise performance was assessed through completion of a broken bronco exercise test on days 5 and 6 of supplementation. Players self-reported muscle soreness and tolerability to supplements using a modified Muscle Pain and Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire throughout the supplement duration. NAC produced a likely beneficial performance effect on maximum shuttle sprint time (2.4%; 90% confidence limit ± 4.8%) but was unclear on total time during back-to-back broken bronco tests compared to placebo. NAC had a likely protective effect on subjective muscle soreness during days 1–4 of supplementation (−19% ± 27%) but a very likely harmful effect on days 5 and 6 of supplementation (71% ± 59%). Daily supplementation with 1 g of oral NAC for six days produced no adverse side effects, reduced muscle soreness after one bout of damaging exercise, but increased soreness following the second bout. The performance effects were generally unclear apart from maximal sprint time.","2019","2020-05-20 00:07:22","2020-05-20 00:07:22","","443-453","","4","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","","","","https://gateway.library.qut.edu.au/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=c8h&AN=137207922&site=ehost-live&scope=site","Exercise Test; Human; Acetylcysteine -- Administration and Dosage; Acetylcysteine -- Therapeutic Use; Administration, Oral; Athletes, Elite; Athletic Performance; Descriptive Statistics; Dietary Supplementation; Exercise; High-Intensity Interval Training; Muscle Pain -- Prevention and Control; Questionnaires; Rugby; Sprinting","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The participants were measured in the hip flexion (ROM) and the jumping ability was assessed with countermovement jump (CMJ) with the arms akimbo, and countermovement jump with free arms (CMJFREE). Two-way repeated measures analyses of variance revealed no significant difference between the two groups in any variable. However, there were observed significant differences between the pre-and post-intervention measurements in ROM and CMJ performance.

Twenty youth Portuguese under-15 football players participated in this study. All players were exposed to two training approaches: i) traditional, in which the players performed a total of 36 kicks in a blocked and repetitive approach; and ii) differential learning, which consisted in the 36 kicks using differential variations in each kick. Football kicking impact and velocity were assessed using a Stalker radar gun, while the kicking accuracy was assessed by aggregating the total number of points achieved during 12 kicks into a goal, which was divided into quantifiable scoring zones. Lastly, leg power was measured using a countermovement jump. Measurements were performed at baseline, post-intervention, and following a 35-minute training match. The comparisons between the baseline and post-test revealed that the differential learning approach promoted a possibly ~5% increase in the countermovement jump (small effects) and a likely ~3% increase in the average velocity (small effects) when compared with the traditional training approach. From the accuracy perspective, there was a moderate decrease from the baseline to the post-test and post-match in accurate kicks into zone 1 (centre of the goal) and a moderate decrease from the baseline to the post-match in accurate kicks into zone 5 (lateral zones at short height) in the differential intervention. In turn, a small increase in the accurate kicks into zones 4 and 6 (lateral zones of the goal and nearest to the bar, respectively) was found from the baseline to the post-match in the differential intervention. Overall, the differential learning intervention was more beneficial than a traditional training protocol with respect to acute improvements in countermovement jump performance, football kicking velocity and higher scoring zones kicking accuracy.","2019","2020-05-20 00:07:23","2020-05-20 00:07:23","","","","10","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0224280; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2003463170","football player; human; article; controlled study; training; juvenile; learning; leg; telecommunication","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: High school and collegiate football players (n = 857) were prospectively enrolled. Forty-one athletes with concussion and 43 matched control athletes met inclusion criteria. Serum levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor, C-reactive protein, interferon-γ, and IL-1 receptor antagonist and Sport Concussion Assessment Tool, 3rd edition (SCAT3) symptom severity scores were collected at a preinjury baseline, 6 and 24-48 hours postinjury, and approximately 8, 15, and 45 days following concussion. The number of days that athletes were symptomatic following SRC (i.e., duration of symptoms) was the primary outcome variable. RESULTS: IL-6 and IL-1RA were significantly elevated in athletes with concussion at 6 hours relative to preinjury and other postinjury visits, as well as compared to controls (ps ≤ 0.001). IL-6 and IL-1RA significantly discriminated concussed from control athletes at 6 hours postconcussion (IL-6 area under receiver operating characteristic curve 0.79 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.65-0.92], IL-1RA AUC 0.79 [95% CI 0.67-0.90]). Further, IL-6 levels at 6 hours postconcussion were significantly associated with the duration of symptoms (hazard ratio for symptom recovery = 0.61 [95% CI 0.38-0.96], p = 0.031). CONCLUSIONS: Results support the potential utility of IL-6 and IL-1RA as serum biomarkers of SRC and demonstrate the potential of these markers in identifying athletes at risk for prolonged recovery after SRC. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class III evidence that serum levels of IL-6 and IL-1RA 6 hours postconcussion significantly discriminated concussed from control athletes.","2019","2020-05-20 00:07:24","2020-05-20 00:07:24","","e497-e507","","5","93","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628628924; http://dx.doi.org/10.1212/WNL.0000000000007864","human; male; football; sport injury; injury; pathophysiology; brain concussion; adolescent; athlete; young adult; C reactive protein; convalescence; cytokine; gamma interferon; IL10 protein, human; IL1B protein, human; IL1RN protein, human; IL6 protein, human; immunology; interleukin 1 receptor blocking agent; interleukin 10; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; prognosis; TNF protein, human; tumor necrosis factor","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, more knowledge is needed to determine the key exercise characteristics for obtaining these effects and how they translate into real-world settings. In the present study, we investigate how small-sided football games of either high- or moderate-intensity affect measures of inhibitory control in a school setting. Eighty-one children (mean age 11.8, 48 boys) were randomly allocated to three groups performing 20-minute of high-intensity small-sided real football games (SRF), moderate-intensity small-sided walking football games (SWF) or resting (RF). Behavioral measures of inhibitory control and neurophysiological measures of attention (P300 latency and amplitude) were obtained during a flanker task performed at baseline and 20 minutes following the intervention. Retention of declarative memory was assessed in a visual memory task 7 days after the intervention. Measures of inhibitory control improved more in children performing SRF compared to SWF 19 ms, 95% CI [7, 31 ms] (P = 0.041). This was paralleled by larger increases in P300 amplitudes at Fz in children performing SRF compared both to RF in congruent (3.54 μV, 95% CI [0.85, 6.23 μV], P = 0.039) and incongruent trials (5.56 μV, 95% CI [2.87, 8.25 μV], P < 0.001) and compared to SWF in incongruent trials (4.10 μV, 95% CI [1.41, 6.68 μV], P = 0.010). No effects were found in measures of declarative memory. Together this indicates that acute high-intensity small-sided football games can transiently improve measures of inhibitory control and neurophysiological correlates of attention. Intense small-sided football games are easily implementable and can be employed by practitioners, for example, during breaks throughout the school day.","2019","2020-05-20 00:07:25","2020-05-20 00:07:25","","1546-1562","","10","29","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628037695; http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/sms.13485","female; human; male; soccer; controlled study; cognition; randomized controlled trial; attention; child; child behavior; memory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In fact, women experience worse symptoms, and take longer to recover (1). While the pathophysiology of concussion remains poorly understood, recent research suggests concussion may reduce cerebral blood flow (2). However, there is limited research regarding the acute effects of concussion on cerebral blood flow in women. The objective of our research study was to investigate sex differences in cerebral blood flow immediately post-concussion in recreational rugby players. Methods: A total of 41 adult concussed players (25 men; 16 women) and 55 adult control players (39 men; 16 women) participated in our study. All participants had participated in a rugby match prior to enrolling. Concussed players had suffered a head injury during the match that resulted in their referral to the medical staff for evaluation. Players that did not need further treatment were offered the opportunity to participate in this study. Control participants were individuals who did not sustain a head injury during matches. Portable data collection tents were set up along the sidelines of ruby matches where a subset of participants underwent duplex ultrasonography of the internal carotid artery (ICA) in the seated and supine positions. Continuous blood pressure, ECG and end-tidal CO2 were obtained in addition to cerebral blood flow metrics. Results: There was significantly lower ICA blood flow in the supine position in concussed male players (n=14) compared to control male players (n = 25) (concussed = 514 ±85; control = 592 ± 149 ml/min; p = 0.043), however, there were no significant differences in the seated position between concussed (n=11) and control (n = 21) male players (concussed = 622± 155; control = 573 ± 122 ml/min; p = 0.327). In contrast, concussed female players (n = 9) demonstrated a trend towards greater ICA flow in the seated position in compared to control female players (n=14) (concussed = 570± 110; control = 450 ± 153 ml/min; p = 0.055). There was no difference in supine ICA flow between concussed (n = 8) and control (n = 15) female rugby players (concussed = 459 ±92; control = 482 ± 183 ml/min; p = 0.751). There were no differences in end-tidal CO2 between concussed and control male players when supine (concussed = 40.4 ±6.5; control = 39.9 ± 5.5 mmHg; p = 0.790) or seated (concussed = 41.3 ±4.3; control = 38.4± 5.9 mmHg; p = 0.115) or female players when supine (concussed = 40.4 ±6.5; control = 39.9 ±5.5 mmHg; p = 0.790) or seated (concussed = 41.3 ±4.3; control = 38.4 ±5.9 mmHg; p = 0.115). Conclusions: Our data suggest that acute concussions are associated with reduced cerebral blood flow in adult male rugby players when supine. In contrast, concussed female players appear to be hyperperfused when seated. Cerebral blood flow changes could not be explained by end-tidal CO2, since there were no differences between groups. These data are the first to demonstrate that in the acute phase of concussion men and women demonstrate differing cerebral blood flow responses. However, this study involved a relatively small number of female players and a larger dataset is needed to determine confirm these findings.

Previous groin-specific prevention programmes have not shown a significant reduction in groin injury rates. An exercise programme using the Copenhagen Adduction exercise increases hip adduction strength, a key risk factor for groin injuries. However, its preventive effect is yet to be tested. AIM: To evaluate the effect of a single-exercise approach, based on the Copenhagen Adduction exercise, on the prevalence of groin problems in male football players. METHODS: 35 semiprofessional Norwegian football teams were cluster-randomised into an intervention group (18 teams, 339 players) and a control group (17 teams, 313 players). The intervention group performed an Adductor Strengthening Programme using one exercise, with three progression levels, three times per week during the preseason (6-8 weeks), and once per week during the competitive season (28 weeks). The control group were instructed to train as normal. The prevalence of groin problems was measured weekly in both groups during the competitive season using the Oslo Sports Trauma Research Center Overuse Injury Questionnaire. RESULTS: The average prevalence of groin problems during the season was 13.5% (95% CI 12.3% to 14.7%) in the intervention group and 21.3% (95% CI 20.0% to 22.6%) in the control group. The risk of reporting groin problems was 41% lower in the intervention group (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.86, p=0.008). CONCLUSION: The simple Adductor Strengthening Programme substantially reduced the self-reported prevalence and risk of groin problems in male football players.

Additionally, the three-year development of highly talented girls' motor performance and the predictive value of this motor development for reaching a professional adult performance level (APL) was analysed.Overall, N = 737 female players participated in nationwide motor diagnostics (sprinting, agility, dribbling, ball control, shooting) within the German Soccer Association's talent identification and development programme at least twice between the age groups Under-12 (U12) and U15. Based on their APL at least four years later, participants were assigned to a professional (first German division, 6.2%) or non-professional group (lower divisions, 93.8%).Multilevel regression analyses revealed a general prognostic relevance for the investigated parameters with respect to players' APL. In addition, there was a non-linear improvement in participants' motor performance across all variables from U12 to U15. However, non-significant interactions between APL and these improvements indicate motor performance development itself cannot adequately predict players' future success in adulthood. Findings provide insightful information that can help coaches foster optimal support for young female soccer players' development.","2019","2020-05-20 00:07:28","2020-05-20 00:07:28","","1-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02640414.2019.1686940; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629752958","adult; female; human; human experiment; article; football; soccer player; major clinical study; adolescent; prognosis; child; adulthood; agility; longitudinal study; motor development; motor performance; multilevel analysis; predictive value; validity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We chose these events because a) their outcomes are highly uncertain and b) they attract a lot of attention and feature heavily in the communication on social media. We also obtained a priori expectations for the events from political forecasting and sport betting websites. Using this quasi-experimental design, we found that unexpected events are associated with more intense affect than expected events. Moreover, the effect of expectations is larger for outcomes that fall below expectations than outcomes that exceed expectations.

Measurements included body height, body weight and sitting height to estimate age at peak height velocity (APHV); three Körperkoordinationstest für Kinder subtests (i.e. jumping sideways (JS), moving sideways (MS), balancing backwards (BB)) to assess generic motor coordination; the UGent dribbling test for soccer specific motor coordination; a 5m/30m sprint and T-test for speed and agility, respectively. Age specific z-scores of the predicted APHV identified players as earlier, on time or later maturing. (M)ANOVA analyses showed significant age by maturity interaction effects for the speed and agility test cluster, revealing maturity related differences in U14 and U15 players. Next to an overall higher performance with age for all test clusters (η2 0.080-0.468), earlier maturing players outperformed their later maturing peers in 5m/30m sprinting. The opposite was seen for JS and BB. So, players' maturity status should be taken into account to adequately value performance in talent identification. Also, the focus on characteristics that appear to be minimally biased by an earlier maturational timing (i.e. motor coordination) should be increased.","2019","2020-05-20 00:07:31","2020-05-20 00:07:31","","196-203","","2","37","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02640414.2018.1488454; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L625471475","human; male; soccer; adolescent; physiology; body weight; motor performance; age; aptitude; body height; sexual maturation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Background: Repetitive head impacts in young athletes are potentially detrimental to later-life neurological function; however, it is unknown what the short-term effects are in collegiate student-athletes. Design/Methods: Neurocognitive performance was assessed using the Immediate Post- Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing (ImPACT) test in 4,376 male athletes (age=19.3±1.5 years; mass=96.3±20.3 kg; height=185.0±7.4 cm). Athletes were grouped by sport participation (football or non-contact) and eAFE (eAFE<12 or eAFE≥12). The outcome measures were the four primary cognitive scores and the symptom severity score from ImPACT. Primary outcomes were assessed across groups, controlling for age, learning accommodations, and concussion history. Generalized linear modeling was used for prediction of each cognitive domain score and the symptom severity score. Results: Neurocognitive performance was not associated with the eAFE-by-group interaction (Verbal Memory, p=0.323; Visual Memory, p=0.198; Visual Motor Speed, p=0.293; Reaction Time, p=0.554). The eAFE-by-group interaction was only a significant predictor of symptom severity scores. For symptom severity, pairwise comparisons suggested that the football, eAFE<12 interaction reported lower severity scores than all other groups (non-contact, eAFE<12: mean difference=-0.97, p<0.001, Cohen's d=0.11; non-contact, eAFE≥12: mean difference=-0.92, p<0.001, Cohen's d=0.11; football, eAFE≥12: mean difference=-0.56, p<0.001, Cohen's d=0.08). Considering the small effect sizes, these findings are of minimal clinical significance. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that participation in tackle football before age 12 does not result in neurocognitive deficits in college. Therefore, we suggest that either consequences of early exposure to repetitive head impacts do not manifest until later in life, symptoms of neurological impairment progress with increased exposure to repetitive head impacts throughout and beyond collegiate play, or there is no association between earlier eAFE and neurocognitive functioning. Future longitudinal studies are warranted.","2019","2020-05-20 00:07:32","2020-05-20 00:07:32","","","","15","92","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629300864","adult; conference abstract; human; male; football; controlled study; concussion; young adult; prediction; velocity; outcome assessment; learning; longitudinal study; cognitive defect; effect size; group dynamics; neurologic disease; reaction time; student athlete; verbal memory; visual memory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Muscle flexibility is a main component of health-related fitness and one of the basic components of fitness for the performance in some sports. Sport and health professionals require the flexibility profile of soccer to define quantitative aims in the training of flexibility. The aim of this study was to identify age-related differences in lower extremity flexibility in youth soccer players. Methods. Seventy-two young male soccer players (age: 13.0 ± 3.1 y; body mass: 50.5 ± 15.3 kg; stature 158.2 ± 16.8 cm; BMI: 19.6 ± 2.6 kg/m2) completed this study. Measures of eleven passive hip (hip extension (HE), hip adduction with hip flexed 90° (HAD-HF90°), hip flexion with knee flexed (HF-KF) and extended (HF-KE), hip abduction with hip neutral (HAB) and hip flexed 90° (HAB-HF90°), hip external (HER) and internal (HIR) rotation), knee (knee flexion (KF)) and ankle dorsiflexion (ankle dorsiflexion with knee flexed (ADF-KF) and extended (ADF-KE)) ranges of motion (ROM) were taken. Descriptive statistics were calculated for hip, knee and ankle ROM measured separately by leg (dominant and non-dominant) and age-group (U10, U12, U14, U16 and U19). The data was analysed using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to examine the interaction of 11 ROM in the different players' age-group. Results. Generally, U10 and/or U12 soccer players obtain the highest mean value in almost all ROM evaluated (U10: HAD-HF [39.6° ± 4.3°], ADF-KE [32.3° ± 4.1°], HER [63.5° ± 5.6°] and HAB-HF90° [64.1° ± 7.5°]; U12: HE [17.7° ± 6.2°], HAB [35.6° ± 3.0], HIR [60.8° ± 4.7°] and KF [133.8° ± 7.1°]). Nonetheless, significant differences between the players' age-groups are just found in HAD-HF90° (pD:042; ES = .136), HAB (p = :001; ES = .252), HIR (p = :001; ES = .251), HER (p < :001; ES = .321) and HAB-HF90° (p<:001; ES = .376) ROM, showing a progressive and irregular decrease in these ROM until the U19 team. Conclusion. The findings of this study reinforce the necessity of prescribing exercises aimed at improving HAD-HF90° ROM in U16, HAB ROM in U14, HIR ROM in U16 and U19, HER ROM in U12 and U19, and HAB-HF90° ROM in U16 and U19 players within everyday soccer training routines.","2019","2020-05-20 00:07:33","2020-05-20 00:07:33","","","","1","2019","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.6236; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L626285172","adult; female; human; male; article; football; soccer player; hip; exercise; controlled study; adolescent; analysis of variance; body mass; juvenile; child; school child; body height; abduction; adduction; adolescence; ankle; knee function; prescription; range of motion; rotation; statistics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, no studies using modern tracking techniques have examined the effects of age on competitive match play performance. Thus, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of age on match physical and technical performance using a large-scale analysis of match performance in professional soccer players. A total of 14 546 individual match observations were undertaken in the first German league (Bundesliga) during the 2012-2013, 2013-2014, and 2014-2015 seasons using a computerized tracking system (VISTRACK, by Impire Corp.). Differences in physical and technical match performance of soccer players were analyzed for the following variables: total distance covered, number of fast runs, number of sprints, and percentage of successful passes. Professional soccer players aged >30 years showed a significant lower performance in the total distance covered, the number of fast runs, and the number of sprints compared with younger players (≤30 years). Conversely, the player's ability to make successful passes increased with age. These effects were observed in all positional roles except wide midfielders. These findings may help coaches and managers to better understand the effects of age on match-related physical and technical performance and may have the potential to assist in decisions such as, when a new contract would be signed, the duration of the contract, the salary, or when to replace or transfer a player depending on their age.","2019","2020-05-20 00:07:34","2020-05-20 00:07:34","","1421-1427","","9","29","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628027824; http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/sms.13463","adult; human; soccer; adolescent; young adult; physiology; age; athletic performance; competitive behavior","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For this purpose, a total of 114 young male soccer players from a high-performance soccer academy participated in this investigation. Anthropometric and physical variables (countermovement jump, 6×40 m shuttle run test, 2×11 m slalom test with the ball) were determined. Results. Body height (U15<U17~U20; p<0.01) and body mass significantly increased (U15<U17<U20; p<0.01) while body fat decreased with age (U15~U17>U20; p<0.01). However, the relationships of these variables with age were explained by curvilinear polynomial equations with a tendency for plateauing at ~17 years of age. There were also age-based differences in maximal running velocity (U15<U17<U20; p<0.01), running velocity with ball (U15<U17~U20; p<0.01) and jump height (U15<U17<U20; p<0.01). The relationships of the physical variables with age were explained by curvilinear polynomial equations with plateaus starting at~17 years of age. In young soccer players, the evolution of individual anthropometric and physical condition is strongly related to player's age as part of the qualitative adaptations that accompany growth. However, the growth process cannot be explained by linear models because most of the variables reached a plateau when players were 17 years of age.

We selected a sample of 16 players on the basis of their penalty statistics. We used semi-directed retrospective interviews to collect players'; biographic narratives. The results show a socialization process into an aggressive style, supported by the dominant gender and socialization norms of the sport, which is under the influence of the structure of the sports organization. However, there are large differences between players, with only some of them adopting an aggressive style. Although many studies have underlined the influence of moral disengagement, the present results suggest that time also matters and that the diversity of career paths may explain the diversity in attitudes. Socialization differences in the sports field, bodily capital, a career path marked by thwarted reputation are the key factors that drive players to adopt an aggressive style.

Therefore, and in order to establish the level of agreement between bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) and dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in elite football referees, the aim of this study was to compare fat mass (FM) and fat-free mass (FFM) values measured with these two different methods. Method: A total of 30 male referees belonging to 1st, 2nd and 2ndB categories, and 36 assistant referees from 1st and 2nd categories in the Spanish national league participated in this study. Total and regional FM and FFM were assessed using a portable BIA analyser TANITA BC 418-MA (Tanita Corp., Tokyo, Japan) and DXA (Hologic Corp. Software version 12.4, Bedford, MA 01730). Agreement between methods was assessed by plotting the results in Bland- Altman graphs and the presence of heteroscedasticity was also examined. Differences between methods were analysed by two-paired samples t-test. Results: For the whole group, BIA underestimated body fat percentage in 3.87 points (CI 95%=3.22-4.52; p=<0.01) and overestimated kg of total FFM in 3.56 points (CI 95%=3.08-4.05; p=<0.01), however, no heteroscedasticity was shown in any case (all p>0.05). Conclusions: The present study suggests that according to DXA, BIA values calculated with a non-specific equation are underestimating total FM and, consequently, overestimating total FFM in male elite football referees. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR Objetivo: La literatura científica existente sobre la composición corporal en árbitros de fútbol es todavía escasa. Por lo tanto y para establecer el nivel de concordancia entre el análisis de impedancia bioeléctrica y la absorciometría de rayos X de doble energía en árbitros de fútbol de elite, el objetivo de este estudio fue comparar los valores de masa grasa (MG) y la masa libre de grasa (MLG) medidos con ambos métodos. Método: Un total de 30 árbitros pertenecientes a las categorías de 1a, 2a y 2a división B, y 36 asistentes de 1a y 2a división de la liga española participaron en este estudio. La MG y la MLG tanto a nivel total como regional se evaluó utilizando la impedancia bioeléctrica TANITA BC 418-MA (Tanita Corp., Tokyo, Japan) y absorciometría de rayos X de doble energía (Hologic Corp. Software versión 12.4, Bedford, MA 01730). La concordancia entre métodos se evaluó con gráficos de Bland-Altman y también se examinó la presencia de heterocedasticidad. Las diferencias entre métodos se analizaron con la prueba T de Student para muestras relacionadas. Resultados: Para el total de la muestra, la impedancia bioeléctrica infraestimó el porcentaje de MG en 3.87 puntos (IC 95%=3.22-4.52; p=<0.01) y sobreestimó los kg de MLG en 3.56 puntos (IC 95%=3.08-4.05; p=<0.01), sin embargo, en ningún caso se observó heterocedasticidad (todos p>0.05). Conclusión: El presente estudio sugiere que, tomando como referencia la absorciometría de rayos X de doble energía, la impedancia bioeléctrica calculada a partir de una ecuación no especifica para árbitros, infraestima la MG y consecuentemente, sobreestima la MLG en árbitros de fútbol de elite.

J Strength Cond Res 33(10): 2655-2664, 2019-The purpose of this study was to evaluate indicators of muscle damage and hormonal responses after soccer matches and its relation to alpha-actinin-3 (ACTN3) gene expression (XX vs. RR/RX), considering that the R allele produces alpha-actinin-3 and provides greater muscle strength and power. Thirty players (10 XX and 20 RR/RX) younger than 16 years were evaluated in this study. Blood samples were collected immediately before, after, 2, and 4 hours after the games to assess muscle damage (creatine kinase [CK] and alpha-actin) and hormonal responses (interleukin-6 [IL-6], cortisol, and testosterone). Postgame CK was higher as compared to the pregame values in both groups and it was also higher in the RR/RX (p < 0.05) than in the XX. The concentrations of alpha-actin and IL-6 were similar for both groups and did not change over time. Testosterone was increased after the game only in the RR/RX group (p < 0.05). Cortisol concentrations in group RR/RX were higher immediately after the game than before the game, and 2 and 4 hours after the game the concentration decreased (p < 0.05). The RR and RX individuals presented higher markers of muscle microtrauma and hormonal stress, probably because they performed more speed and power actions during the game, which is a self-regulated activity. From the different responses presented by RR/RX and XX genotypes, we conclude that the genotypic profile should be taken into account when planning training workloads and recovery of athletes.

Highly trained futsal players (11 men, age range 20-31 y), endurance athletes (11 men, age range 18-31 y), sprinters (11 men, age range 21-30 y), and control group (11 men, age range 22-34 y) were examined across four characteristic training phases in response to an incremental treadmill test until exhaustion. A considerably higher exercise and post-exercise plasma adenosine triphosphate concentrations were observed in consecutive training phases in highly trained athletes, with the highest values reached after the competitive period. No differences in plasma adenosine triphosphate concentrations were found in the control group during the 1 y cycle. Sprinters showed a higher absolute and net increase in plasma adenosine triphosphate concentration by 60-114% during exercise in consecutive training phases than futsal players (63-101%) and endurance athletes (64-95%). In this study, we demonstrated that exercise-induced adenosine triphosphate concentration significantly changes in highly trained athletes over an annual training cycle. The obtained results showed that high-intensity but not lowto moderate-intensity training leads to an increased adenosine triphosphate response to exercise, suggesting an important role of ATP for vascular plasticity.","2019","2020-05-20 00:07:39","2020-05-20 00:07:39","","","","10","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/metabo9100230; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002866314","adult; human; male; article; exercise; oxygen consumption; controlled study; training; athlete; adenosine diphosphate; adenosine phosphate; adenosine triphosphate; endurance athlete; futsal player; high performance liquid chromatography; liquid chromatograph; respiratory compensation point; respiratory tract parameters; runner; spectrophotometry; treadmill test","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data were prospectively collected from high school female soccer participants (14-18 years) at up to three time points over 9 months. Head impacts were monitored using accelerometers during all practices and games. Participants were assigned to a collar (n=24) or non-collar group (n=22). The Tract-Based Spatial Statistics approach was used in the analysis of within-group longitudinal change and between-group comparisons. RESULTS: DTI analyses revealed significant pre-season to post-season WM changes in the non-collar group in mean diffusivity (2.83%±2.46%), axial diffusivity (2.58%±2.34%) and radial diffusivity (3.52%±2.60%), but there was no significant change in the collar group despite similar head impact exposure. Significant correlation was found between head impact exposure and pre-season to post-season DTI changes in the non-collar group. WM changes in the non-collar group partially resolved at 3 months off-season follow-up. DISCUSSION: Microstructural changes in WM occurred during a season of female high school soccer among athletes who did not wear the collar device. In comparison, there were no changes in players who wore the collar, suggesting a potential prophylactic effect of the collar device in preventing changes associated with repetitive head impacts. In those without collar use, the microstructural changes showed a reversal towards normal over time in the off-season follow-up period.","2019","2020-05-20 00:07:40","2020-05-20 00:07:40","","1539-1551","","24","53","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bjsports-2018-099571; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L630005610","female; human; soccer; diagnostic imaging; injury; prospective study; adolescent; physiology; head injury; longitudinal study; competitive behavior; compression bandage; diffusion tensor imaging; echography; jugular vein; pathology; recurrent disease; white matter","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Sensorimotor deficits have been demonstrated in athletes post-concussion, however, little is known about the effects of concussion on the musculoskeletal system. If deficits persist post-concussion, this could possibly be a contributing factor for future concussions or musculoskeletal injuries. Physiotherapy intervention may assist in rehabilitation of sensorimotor deficits post-concussion. However, it is important to establish whether a history of concussion has residual effects on the sensorimotor system, in particular, the musculoskeletal system. Methods: A total of 214 male adolescent (13–18 years old) rugby players in Queensland, Australia underwent assessment of sensorimotor function during the preseason. Assessment of sensorimotor function included testing of cervical spine function (proprioception), measurement of size and contraction of lumbopelvic muscles (ultrasound imaging) and balance testing (sway velocity). Players were allocated into two groups: no history of concussion in the last 12 months (n = 165), and concussion in the last 12 months (n = 49). Results: Players with a history of concussion had significantly larger lumbopelvic muscles than players without a history of concussion (p < 0.05). The largest mean differences occurred for quadratus lumborum (8.3 % larger; 7.42 and 6.85 cm2 in players with and without a history of concussion respectively) and for lumbar multifidus at L5 vertebral level (6.6 % larger; 8.13 and 7.63 cm2 in players with and without a history of concussion respectively). The results also indicated that the players with a history of concussion had a 24 % larger lumbar multifidus muscle contraction on testing at the L2/3 zygapophyseal joint level (p = 0.04). There were no differences between groups for assessment of cervical spine function and balance testing (p > 0.05). Discussion: A difference in lumbopelvic muscle size and function was found in adolescent rugby union players with a history of concussion. This may represent residual effects of concussion on the musculoskeletal system. The increased size and contraction of lumbopelvic muscles may reflect altered movement strategies such as splinting and over-holding of trunk muscles. Changes in neuromuscular control of the lumbopelvic region may contribute to the risk of subsequent injuries in athletes returning to sports after concussion and warrants further investigation. This study established the effects of concussion on lumbopelvic muscle size and function, and may help guide physiotherapy intervention in athletes returning to sports after concussion.","2019","2020-05-20 00:07:41","2020-05-20 00:07:41","","S45-S46","","","22","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsams.2019.08.226; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002914889","adult; conference abstract; human; male; rugby; controlled study; major clinical study; adolescent; athlete; concussion; muscle contraction; cervical spine; multifidus muscle; muscle mass; musculoskeletal injury; physiotherapy; proprioception; Queensland; sensorimotor function; splinting; trunk; ultrasound; zygapophyseal joint","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: Thirty-six collegiate soccer players fulfilling the eligibility criteria were randomly divided into three groups: complex training (n = 12; BMI 22.95 ± 1.76 kg/m2), contrast training (n = 12; BMI 22.05 ± 2.03 kg/m2), and control (n = 12; BMI 22.27 ± 1.44 kg/m2). Athletes from the complex or contrast group were trained for 6 weeks (3 days/week). The complex group performed four different exercises, each comprised of strength [80% of one repetition maximum (1RM)] and power components alternately. The contrast group performed the same strengthening exercises alternately at two different intensities (40% and 80% of 1RM). No supervised training was given to control group. All athletes were tested for their state anxiety, trait anxiety, and sleep quality before and after 6 weeks of training. Results: 3 × 2 mixed ANOVA revealed significant difference in time effect (p ≤ 0.001) and time × group interaction (p ≤ 0.001) for state anxiety while non-significant difference was found in the group effect. There was no significant difference found between the groups for sleep quality and trait anxiety. Conclusions: The results of the present study demonstrated that anaerobic exercises have a positive impact to reduce state anxiety. Therefore, coaches should utilize these findings and implement anaerobic exercises to the training regime for reduction of anxiety among athletes.

Changes in SSG characteristics (e.g., pitch size, rules, number of players per team) allow coaches to emphasize specific behaviors, according to the goal of the training session. Additionally, changes in teams' composition criteria might influence the interactions between players during teams' offensive process. Teams ' composition criteria are the rules used to divide players into teams. This study analyzed the influence of teams' composition criteria in the network properties during soccer small-sided games. Twelve male U-15 soccer athletes from a high-level team from the city of Curitiba participated in the study. Athletes performed four small-sided games bouts in the 3vs.3 + goalkeepers format with two team composition criteria: a) three athletes from the same playing position (e.g., three forwards) on each team; and b) three athletes from different playing positions (e.g., a defender, a midfielder and a forward) in each team. Network properties (related to the team -- macro analysis) and levels of prominence (related to the athletes -- micro analysis) were analyzed through the Social Network Analysis. An one-way ANOVA (or Kruskal-Wallis test for non-parametric variables) was used to compare the mean values between playing positions. For the macro analysis, an independent t-test (or Mann-Whitney test for non-parametric variables) was used. In all cases, the level of significance was set at p <0.05. Results showed lower prominence of goalkeepers compared to the other positions using both teams' composition criteria. Midfielders also presented lower prominence compared to defenders when team were formed by athletes of the same position. In summary, changes in teams' composition criteria modify athletes' levels of prominence during 3vs.3 small-sided games.

Participated in the study 108 athletes that represents the city of Londrina at the Youth Games of Paraná in 2008 and 2011 in the modalities of futsal, handball, basketball and volleyball. Body composition, height, body mass, vertical jumps, agility, speed tests, abdominal flexions and the Leger running test were conducted. PCA was used to summarize the variables investigated. Four principal components were identified for futsal and volleyball, representing 79,7% and 77% of the total variance and 3 principal components for basketball and handball, accounting for 77% and 81,6% of the total variance. The PCA was able to identify and discriminate the variables that most respond by the total variance in collective modalities. The variables that contributed the most to the formation of the components are in agreement with the main specific attributes of the modalities studied, thus identifying the main variables that in theory contribute to the sporting success in the modalities in question.

Method: Data from thirty-four technical criteria from matches of the Spanish League between the 2013/2014 and 2017/2018 seasons were gathered. Following data collection, a mathematical method - named Multi-Attribute Value Theory - was used, enabling the acquisition of a single performance indicator. In addition to this indicator, six attributes were generated to compose the analysis and description of the teams' style of play: Outcomes, Shots, Buildup Play, Ball Recovery, Goal Protection and Fouls. Results: The team with the most points in the overall ordering was Barcelona, whereas it also displayed the highest indexes in attributes such as Results, Buildup Play and Fouls. As for the attributes Ball Recovery, and Goal Protection, the highest values were obtained by Atletico Madrid. Lastly, the highest values regarding the attribute Shots were obtained by Real Madrid. Conclusion: The study was satisfactory, since the ordering obtained was related to the final league table, besides providing performance indicators that contribute to the analysis of the teams' technical and tactical behavior. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR Objetivo: Este estudio propuso una aplicación de método multicriterio de atributos de análisis de rendimiento en equipos de fútbol, permitiendo el entendimiento del perfil de comportamiento técnico-táctico de estos equipos. Método: Se han recogido datos referentes a 34 criterios técnicos de partidos de fútbol de la Liga Española, entre las temporadas 2013/2014 y 2017/2018. En seguida se aplicó un método matemático llamado Multi-Attribute Value Theory, que posibilitó la obtención de un solo indicador de rendimiento. Además de este indicador, se crearon 6 atributos para la composición del análisis y descripción del estilo de juego de los equipos, a saber: Resultados, Remates, Construcción del Juego, Recuperación del Balón, Protección de la Portería e Infracciones. Resultado: El equipo que obtuvo más pontos en el ordenamiento general fue el Barcelona, mientras que todavía logra los valores más altos en atributos como Resultados, Construcción del Juego e Infracciones. Sin embargo, en los atributos de Recuperación del Balón y Protección de la Portería, el mayor valor fue obtenido por el Atlético de Madrid. Finalmente, el atributo Remates fue liderado por el equipo del Real Madrid.

Methods: Sixteen semi-professional national-level football players (Age: 23.6 ± 3.3 years; Body mass: 78.1 ± 5.2 kg; Height: 1.8 ± 0.1 m) performed 4 SSG with different aims: (a) maintain the ball; (b) maintain and progress; (c) maintain, progress and ending in mini-goals and (d) maintain, progress and ending in a goal with a goalkeeper. To data acquisition, a WIMU PROTM inertial device with dual tracking technology (GNSS and UWB) was used. Results: The main results were: (1) a nearly perfect correlation in the values obtained by both technologies (total distance: r2=.987; mean velocity: r2=.994) and (2) statistical differences between the 4 SSGs in total distance, relative distance, high intensity distance (>16 km/h), sprint distance (>21 km/h), mean velocity and High Metabolic Load Distance per min (p<0.01; F=34.33-4.57; d=2.13-0.80). No statistical differences were found in accelerations/min and decelerations/min (p=0.27-0.08; F=1.31-2.30; d=0.31-0.45). Conclusions: Both tracking technologies could be used to quantify the physical demands. In relation to the aim of small-sided games, this was determinant in the physical demands. Thus, the analysis of game-based tasks is very important to control their effects for a correct application during the training sessions.

Método: Dieciséis jugadores semiprofesionales de fútbol de nivel nacional (Edad: 23.6 ± 3.3 años; Peso: 78.1 ± 5.2 kg; Altura: 1.8 ± 0.1 m) realizaron 4 JRs con diferentes objetivos: (a) conservación de balón; (b) conservación y progresión; (c) conservación, progresión y finalización en múltiples metas sin portero y (d) conservación, progresión y finalización en una meta reglamentaria con portero. El registro de datos se realizó mediante el dispositivo inercial WIMU PROTM, registrando el posicionamiento mediante tecnología dual (GNSS y UWB). Resultados: Los principales resultados fueron: (1) una relación casi perfecta entre los valores obtenidos por ambas tecnologías (distancia total: r2=.987; velocidad media: r2=.994) y (2) diferencias significativas entre los 4 JRs en las variables distancia total, distancia relativa, distancia a alta intensidad, distancia a sprint, velocidad media y High Metabolic Load Distance/min (p<0.01; F=34.33-4.57; d=2.13-0.80). No se encontraron diferencias significativas en las variables aceleraciones/minuto y deceleraciones/minuto (p=0.27-0.08; F=1.31-2.30; d=0.31- 0.45). Conclusión: Ambas tecnologías pueden ser utilizadas indistintamente para la cuantificación de las demandas físicas. En cuanto al objetivo de los JRs, este es determinante en las exigencias físicas que presentan.

Methods: Eight semi-professional football players (21,1 ± 1,5 years; 174,7 ± 3,5 cm; 71,3 ± 4,7 kg) performed 4x4 small-sided games with one touch (SG1T), two touches (SG2T) and three touches of the ball authorized (SG3T), without goalkeeper. Physical variables measured were total distance (TD), high intensity distance (HID) and sprint distance (SD). The tactical/technical variables included were number of successful passes (SP), ball losses (BL), and percentage of successful passes (%SP). Small-sided games were compared with an ANOVA of repeated measures and Pearson r was used to establish correlation between variables. Results: regarding the physical variables, higher values (p < 0,05) were obtained for TD in SG1T (1132,7 ± 61,3) compared to SG3T (1059,1 ± 88,3), and in SG2T (1165,7 ± 60,4) compared to SG3T. HID and SD values were higher (p < 0,05) in SG2T (HID: 145,63 ± 37; SD: 12,88 ± 7,1) than in SG3T (HID: 99,1 ± 33,2; SD: 5,75 ± 5,6). In the tactical/technical variables, SP (36,3 ± 6,4) and BL (28 ± 4,2) were higher in SG1T (p < 0,05) than in SG2T (SP: 26,9 ± 12,2; BL: 14 ± 1,51) and in SG3T (SP: 23,8 ± 3,4; BL: 12,1 ± 2,7). The %SP was smaller (p < 0,05) in SG1T (56,18 ± 7,82) than in SG3T (66,21 ± 7,94). Conclusions: In the physical domain, TD in SG1T was higher than in SG2T and SG3T, being HID and SD smaller in SG3T with respect to SG2T. At the technical-tactical level, SG1T situations showed more SP and less BL than SG2T and SG3T, being the %SP smaller in SG1T than in SG2T.

Individual player performances (n = 298) for substitutes and the starters they replaced were observed across 17 matches played between tier 1 rugby nations. Performance was categorised as the total number of involvements, the number of attacking and defensive involvements, as well as the effectiveness of a player's performance for each of the above involvement categories. Results revealed forward substitutes performed more total (p = 0.001, ES = 0.61), attacking (p = 0.026, ES = 0.32) and defensive (p = 0.023, ES = 0.31) involvements than forward starters; however, there were no differences found for backs (p = 0.819–0.911). In addition, it was observed that an increase in score margin at the time of substitution led to a decrease in the total and attacking involvements per minute that a substitute performed, but an increase in defensive involvements for both forwards and backs. These findings provide a platform for coaches to make tactical decisions regarding substitution patterns during International Rugby matches. Specifically, coaches should prioritise forward substitutions over back substitutions, and implement tactical changes earlier in the second half to gain an advantage over the opposition.

The rise of this sport has been refected in the increase in federation player registrations. The purpose of this paper is to identify, assess and analyse the mood and anxiety of amateur football players in U16 and U19 men and regional women categories before and after competition. The sample consisted of 153 young people whose average age was 16.06 years. The instruments used were the Competitive State Anxiety Inventory (CSAI-2) and Profle of Mood States (POMS) in its abbreviated form A, 15 items. The results show that: 1) there are statistically signifcant differences in all dimensions of mood and cognitive anxiety in men after competition; 2) women present signifcant differences in the dimensions of hostility, depression, vigour and self-confdence after competition; 3) somatic anxiety does not vary according to the outcome obtained in competition; 4) mood prior to competing is different in men and women as there are signifcant differences in tension, and 5) men show a less anxiogenic thinking style, a lower somatic response to anxiety and a higher level of self-confdence at the time prior to competing than women. This paper seeks to encourage future professionals to introduce a commitment to emotional and psychological training alongside physical, technical and strategic instruction in youth age groups in the process of personality development.

A total of 824 corner kicks were analysed examining delivery type, delivery area and attack organisation on corner kick outcomes. A total of 38 goals were scored (4.6% of corners taken resulted in a goal) from the corner kicks, accounting for 13.5% of the total 282 goals scored during the 2017/2018 season. Corner delivery type did not affect the outcome of the corner (p > 0.05). However, delivery zone effected both the likelihood of an attempt on target (p = 0.018) and goal being scored (p < 0.001). Attempts on target were increased when the ball was delivered into the central area of the 18-yard box (zone CA2) with 14.7% of corners delivered to CA2 resulting in an attempt on target. Goals were most likely to be scored when the ball was delivered into the central zone but closer to the goal line (zone GA2) with 13.0% of corner kicks delivered to this zone resulting in a goal. These results can aid coaches to enhance the attacking effectiveness of corner kicks within Women's soccer.

However, little is known of the regular head loading environment associated with tackling in rugby union. In particular, the magnitude and influencing factors for head kinematics during the tackle are poorly understood. Accordingly, the goal of this study was to measure head motion of a visually unaware ball carrier during a real game tackle to the upper trunk with no direct head contact, and compare the kinematics with previously reported concussive events. Model-Based Image-Matching was utilised to measure ball carrier head linear and angular velocities. Ball carrier componential maximum change in head angular velocities of 38.1, 20.6 and 13.5 rad/s were measured for the head local X (coronal plane), Y (sagittal plane) and Z (transverse plane) axes respectively. The combination of a high legal tackle height configuration and visually unaware ball carrier can lead to kinematics similar to average values previously reported for concussive direct head impacts.

The FIFA ranking classification is included in this perspective. This work aims to identify which indicators are discriminating compared to the FIFA ranking, through the analysis of the matches of the World Cup played in Russia in 2018. The selected indicators concern: goals, throws, offside, corners, effectiveness, assists, penalties and ball possession. Through the method of k-means cluster analysis the national teams participating in the world championship were grouped into three groups: high-level teams, intermediate-level teams and low-level teams. The subsequent analysis (one-way ANOVA) revealed statistically significant differences for the shots, corners, assists and ball possession, and above all the differences between high and low level teams. The results obtained lead to think about how decisive can be, to be able to discriminate the strength of a team based on game indicators and how these data can be useful to coaches and performance analysts to assess the performance of their team and those they will have to face.

The sample was comprised of 249 players (n = 109 defenders, n = 113 midfielders; and n = 27 forwards) from four of the major European Leagues (Bundesliga, English FA Premier League, Ligue 1, and La Liga) during the seasons 2008 to 2015. The dependent variables studied were: shooting accuracy, defense (the sum of defensive actions, tackles, blocks, and interceptions), yellow cards, red cards, passing accuracy, tackle success, and minutes played per match. Two-step cluster analysis allowed classifying the sample into three groups of defenders (national important, foreign important, and less important players) and four groups of midfielders and forwards (national important, foreign important, national less important, and foreign less important players). Magnitude Based Inference (MBI) was used to test the differences between player's performances during the years of analyses. The main results (very likely and most likely effects) showed better performance in the year prior to signing a new contract than the previous year for foreign important defenders (decreased number of red cards), national important midfielders (increased number of minutes played), foreign important forwards (increased minutes played and defense), and national important forwards (increased minutes played). In addition, performance was lower the year after signing the contract compared to the previous one for less important defenders (decreasing defense), national less important midfielders (decreased minutes played), and foreign less important forwards (decreased defense). On the other hand, the players showed better performance in defense and more minutes played the year after signing the contract for less important defenders, national less important midfielders, and foreign less important forwards. These results may assist coaches to decide on when a new contract should be signed or the duration of the contract.","2019","2020-05-20 00:07:52","2020-05-20 00:07:52","","","","1","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0211058; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L626070584","football player; human; article; soccer player; major clinical study; season; cluster analysis; dependent variable","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Currently, there is a paucity of literature on the epidemiology of knee injuries in professional male rugby league players. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed medical records from a single male professional rugby league team (Newcastle Knights), competing in Australia, and evaluated knee injuries and time to return to play. Results: In total, 89 knee injuries occurred, with an injury incidence of 616.7 injuries per 1000 players. The most frequently occurring knee injuries were medial collateral ligament (416.7 injuries per 1000 players) and chondral/meniscal injuries (416.7 injuries per 1000 players). For all injury types, being tackled was the most common mechanism of injury, and the median time to return to play was 1 day. Anterior cruciate ligament injuries accounted for the longest time to return to play (median 236.0 days). Conclusion: Medial collateral ligament and chondral/meniscal injury types were the most frequent injuries; however, anterior cruciate ligament injuries accounted for the most time missed from sport despite being less common. Professional male rugby league players incur similar knee injury types compared to rugby union based upon our study and other similar studies.","2019","2020-05-20 00:07:53","2020-05-20 00:07:53","","","","1","5","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002332622; http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40798-019-0206-z","adult; human; male; article; rugby; sport injury; incidence; major clinical study; return to sport; body mass; retrospective study; knee function; anterior cruciate ligament injury; arthroscopy; knee injury; knee instability; knee meniscus rupture; medial collateral ligament; patella dislocation; patellofemoral joint; subtalar joint","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since the beginning of competitive sports, athletes have been trying to improve their abilities by taking various substances. The problem of using prohibited substances is not strictly tied to elite athletes; it is also present in the general population. The aim of this study was to test the knowledge and attitudes of the students regarding the use of stimulative substances and dietary supplements in sports. Methods. A cross-sectional study was performed among students at the College of Health and Professional Studies in Belgrade, Serbia. The data was collected by filling in an especially designed questionnaire. Results. Knowledge of prohibited substances and methods was characterized as “good” with 24.2% of respondents, namely 8.09% of males and 16.1% of females; knowledge of the adverse effects of prohibited substances and methods on health was demonstrated by 17.7% (9.03% of male respondents and 8.72% of female respondents). Conclusion. Student population is not knowledgeable enough about the problems of prohibited substances use and their negative effects on one’s health. The comparative analysis of our and European researches on knowledge, attitudes and uses of prohibited substances show a rather uniform prevalence rate. Not being aware of the adverse effects shows the need to further educate students.","2019","2020-05-20 00:07:54","2020-05-20 00:07:54","","144-151","","2","76","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002404341; http://dx.doi.org/10.2298/VSP170214078S","adult; female; human; human experiment; male; article; football; basketball; scoring system; sport; young adult; questionnaire; cross-sectional study; volleyball; athletic performance; attitude scale; banned ingredient; body building; book; dietary supplement; doping; Internet; laboratory personnel; multiple choice test; personal trainer; pharmacist; physical appearance; physician; physiotherapist; professional knowledge; radiologist; student attitude","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We recorded eight Brazilian soccer matches (four of the national and four of the regional level), using up to six digital cameras (30 Hz). The position information of the 204 players in the eight matches was obtained using an automatic tracking system. The Euclidean distance between the nearest opponents was calculated over time to define the dyads. The interaction between the components of dyads was assessed by the distances between players and was compared among the different positions (defender, full-back, defensive midfielder, midfielder, and forward), match periods (15, 30, 45, 60, 75, and 90 min), and competition levels. Results showed smaller distances for the national level dyads, compared to the regional matches. Greater distances between the players were found in the last 15 minutes of the matches, compared to the other periods. The full-backs were more distant from opposing players compared to players from other playing positions. Thus, coaches should consider the characteristics of each playing position and the greater proximity between opponents' players in top-level competition for the development of tactical proficiency of the players.

Objective: The study was conducted among football team players in the Ukrainian First League in the 2017-2018 season. It was attended by 44 professional football team players in the Ukrainian First League. Results: The volume of motor activity of wing-backs provides for work in zones 1, 2, 4, 6, 7 and 9. Central defenders perform locomotor work mainly in zones 2 and 5. Central midfielders perform more diverse activities in 5 and 8 zones. The actions of the wing-backs provide for moving along the entire sideline in 1, 3, 4, 6 zones, as well as the wingers in 7, 9 and 10, 12 zones. Most of the time, the attack line players are in zones 8 and 11. Thus, the central defenders and wing-backs are inherent in work, which is performed mainly in the aerobic mode, the central midfielders, wingers and forwards are characterized by the performance of motor actions in the aerobic-anaerobic mode, and for the players of the line of attack compared to other roles - in the anaerobic mode. Conclusions. It was established that the motor actions of the central defenders per game are 8015 m (6381 m - at a slow pace, 1232 m - an average of 406 m - high), wing-backs are 9252 m (6651 m; 1712 m; 889 m, respectively), central midfielders 11261 m (7897 m; 3215 m; 1149, respectively), wingers - 10786 m (7141 m; 2575 m; 1070 m, respectively), forwards - 9799 m (5013 m; 2118 m; 2668, respectively).

Methods: Twenty-nine professional U23 soccer outfield players competed across 17 competitive matches during the 2017/18 season, equating to a total of 130 separate physical match profiles. Match activities were recorded using global positioning system (GPS) devices with integrated micro-electrical mechanical systems (MEMS), recording total distance (TD), high-speed running (HSR), and metabolic power (MP). For each individual match profile and variable, 1, 3, and 5 min peak, post-peak, and average values were calculated using fixed-time epochs (FIXED) and rolling averages (ROLL). Linear mixed models were employed to examine the differences in the dependent variables as a function of the method of measurement. Results: Results revealed significantly higher peak values, for relative TD, relative HSR and relative MP when employing the ROLL sampling method, in comparison to the FIXED method, for both 3 min and 5 min epoch lengths. Analysis of epoch length revealed significantly higher peak values, across all positions, for relative TD, relative HSR and MP for 1 min epochs, in comparison to 3 min and 5 min epochs. Conclusions: The data offers a novel insight into the appropriate identification of physical demands during youth soccer match-play. Researchers and practitioners should consider the sampling method and epoch length when assessing the physical demands of competitive match-play, as well as when designing and prescribing sport-specific conditioning drills.","2019","2020-05-20 00:07:56","2020-05-20 00:07:56","","1-9","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02701367.2019.1669766; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629991026","human; article; soccer player; season; running; velocity; juvenile; prescription; dependent variable; physician; global positioning system; microelectromechanical system","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Analysis of playing area dimensions in Spanish professional soccer: Extrapolation to the design of small-sided games with tactical applications. J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2019-The aims of this study were to examine (a) the width and length dimensions of the playing area in 4v4 situations during competition, (b) the influence of the pitch zone where the ball is on 4v4 dimensions, and (c) the influence of match status on the dimensions of 4v4 situations. Data were collected from 25 matches from the Spanish La Liga of the 2007-2008 season using the Amisco system. Length, width, and individual playing area (IPA) of the rectangle that included the nearest 4 players to the ball from each team were collected in a total of 8,727 4v4 game situations. The pitch zone and match status were also considered for these 4v4 situations. To determine factors that affect 4v4 game situations, 1-way analysis of variance was used. The influence of the pitch zone where 4v4 situations took place showed significant differences (p < 0.001) between the zones where different principles of the game apply. The areas of the 4v4 situations ranged from 14.70 ± 4.69 × 17.18 ± 6 to 17.09 ± 5.16 × 20.34 ± 5.93 m, and the IPA of the 4v4 playing rectangle ranged from 46.33 ± 20 to 35.48 ± 16.95 m, being larger in the central zones of the pitch. The length of the 4v4 rectangle showed a significant reduction in the closer zones to the goal. Match status did not affect the dimensions of these 4v4 game situations significantly. The findings of this study suggest that the size of 4v4 situations proposed for training should be designed according to the pitch zone where playing actions take place.","2019","2020-05-20 00:07:57","2020-05-20 00:07:57","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1519/JSC.0000000000003226; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629132547","human; article; soccer; season; competition; analysis of variance; pitch","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Young athletes, coaches, and parents continue to have misconceptions about the necessity of sports specialization, giving athletes the encouragement to focus on a single sport at a younger age. Purpose: To characterize the motivations for specialization and determine when elite athletes in various individual and team sports made the decision to specialize. Study Design: Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: A Likert-style survey was developed and distributed to athletes from two National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I institutions. The survey's Flesch-Kincaid grade level was 6.3. Statistical analysis was performed via the Student t test, where a P value less than .05 was considered significant. Results: A total of 303 athletes with a mean ± SD age of 19.9 ± 1.52 years across 19 sports were surveyed; 94.7% of specialized athletes had previously played another organized sport prior to college, and 45% of athletes had played multiple sports up to age 16 years. The mean age of specialization was 14.9 years, with a significant difference between athletes competing in team (15.5 years) and individual (14.0 years) sports (P = .008). Males in individual sports specialized earlier than those in team sports (P ≤ .001). Nearly one-fifth (17.4%) of athletes reported specializing at age 12 years or earlier. Personal interest, skill level, time constraints, and potential scholarships were the most important reasons for specialization overall. For individual sports, the motivations for specialization were similar, but collegiate (P < .001) or professional (P < .001) ambitions were significantly larger contributing factors. Conclusion: Early sports specialization is uncommon among NCAA Division I athletes for most team sports, whereas individual sports tend to have athletes who specialize earlier and are more motivated by professional and collegiate goals. This study characterized the timing of specialization among elite athletes, providing a basis for understanding the motivations behind youth sports specialization. Physicians should be prepared to discuss the misconception that early sports specialization is necessary or common among most team-focused collegiate-level athletes. Knowing the motivations for sports specialization will guide clinicians in their discussions with youth athletes.","2019","2020-05-20 00:07:58","2020-05-20 00:07:58","","1-1","","1","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","","","","https://gateway.library.qut.edu.au/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=c8h&AN=134898005&site=ehost-live&scope=site","Adult; Female; Male; Athletes, Professional; Football; Human; T-Tests; Athletes, Elite; Athletic Performance; Descriptive Statistics; Adolescence; Athletes, College; Cross Sectional Studies; Mann-Whitney U Test; Motivation; Rowing; Specialization -- Evaluation; Sports Organizations; Sports Participation; Surveys; Team Sports; Track and Field","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

No published reports have investigated the differences in static balance abilities and postural priority among professional soccer players according to field position. Research question: We hypothesized that static balance as well as dynamic postural priority is inﬂuenced by playing position in professional soccer players. Methods: The study covered a group of 101 elite professional soccer players who were divided into six subgroups according to playing positions: goalkeepers (G) (n = 10), central defenders (CD) (n = 15), external defenders (ED) (n = 15), central midfielders (CM) (n = 23), external midfielders (EM) (n = 15) and forwards (F) (n = 23). All participants completed the Delos Postural System Test using the standard protocol. The tests were performed unilaterally on non-dominant (NL) and dominant leg (DL) under static conditions (with open and closed eyes) standing on a stable platform and under dynamic conditions on an unstable base. Results: In the static test with open eyes (ST OE) there were no statistically significant differences between the legs and positions. In the static test with closed eyes (ST CE), the differences are statistically significant only between positions. Players on the CM position have significantly higher differences than G. In the dynamic postural priority test (DPPT) there is a difference between positions and legs. In fact, the statistically higher differentiation refers to players in the CM position relative to ED, CD, EM and F. We noticed a significantly greater difference in the NL compared to the DL.

In this study, we performed an in‐depth analysis of play by the Spanish soccer team during the 2012 UEFA European Championship, where it was crowned champion. Using observational methodology and T‐pattern analysis, we identified hidden patterns of play that ended in a goal for the Spanish team. A generalizability coefficient (e2) of 0.986 demonstrated that the offensive patterns detected are robust and highly generalizable. These patterns were formed by technical actions consisting of ball control and pass, with alternations between short and long passes, in the central area of the rival pitch, with use of both wings to achieve width of play and prioritization of width over depth of play. We also found patterns showing that goals and shots at goal were made on a ball delivered from the opposite direction to the shot and were not preceded by a technical action.

A total of 600 corner kicks from all 64 matches in the tournament were obtained from the InStat database and analysed. Data were analysed and reported as frequency counts and percentages. Chi-square test for independence (χ2) used to test associations between key performance indicators. Results showed that 22 goals (3.7% of all corners kicks) were conceded from corner kicks. Teams conceded more goals using a zonal marking strategy (6.0%) compared to a mixed marking strategy (3.7%). There was a significant association between types of corner kicks and defensive outcomes (χ2 = 111.30,V = 0.57). Most goals were conceded from inswing corner kicks (4.6%) compared to short (3.3%) and outswing (3.1%) corner kicks. Seventeen (3.9%) goals were conceded from corners when there were no players on the goal line. Most goals came from the centre (7.0%) and the first goalpost (3.5%). These findings highlight potential strategies soccer coaches may employ for an effective defensive set-up against corners, such as employing a mixed marking method, having players positioned on the goalposts and being aware of the attacking threat posed by short corner kicks.

This study aimed to identify associations between RP and GPI in professional soccer players and to compare RP and GPI among soccer playing positions. One hundred one match performances were observed over the course of half of a season at the highest level of national competition in Croatia. Players (mean ± SD, age: 23.85 ± 2.88 years; body height: 183.05 ± 8.88 cm; body mass: 78.69 ± 7.17 kg) were classified into five playing positions (central defenders (n = 26), full-backs (n = 24), central midfielders (n = 33), wide midfielders (n = 10), and forwards (n = 8). RP, as measured by global positioning system, included the total distance covered, distance covered in five speed categories (walking, jogging, running, high-speed running, and maximal sprinting), total number of accelerations, number of high-intensity accelerations, total number of decelerations, and number of high-intensity decelerations. The GPI were collected by the position-specific performance statistics index (InStat index). The average total distance was 10,298.4 ± 928.7 m, with central defenders having the shortest and central midfielders having the greatest covered distances. The running (r = 0.419, p = 0.03) and high-intensity accelerations (r = 0.493, p = 0.01) were correlated with the InStat index for central defenders. The number of decelerations of full-backs (r = −0.43, p = 0.04) and the distance covered during sprinting of forwards (r = 0.80, p = 0.02) were associated with their GPI obtained by InStat index. The specific correlations between RP and GPI should be considered during the conditioning process in soccer. The soccer training should follow the specific requirements of the playing positions established herein, which will allow players to meet the game demands and to perform successfully.","2019","2020-05-20 00:08:02","2020-05-20 00:08:02","","","","20","16","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph16204032; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002839360","human; article; football; soccer player; season; competition; deceleration; running; jogging; walking; body height; global positioning system; Croatia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Sixty international field referees (FR) and assistant referees (AR) were analysed in this study. Referee decisions were registered during thirty soccer matches of an international tournament and categorized (e.g., FR, AR and other decisions) for further analysis. The tool ARBI.e was an ad hoc tool created by the authors to assess match official decisions. Cohen's Kappa statistic showed values of 0.914-1.00 and 0.827-1.00 for intra-observer and inter-observer analysis, respectively. Despite the high level of success in both FR and AR (95%), some decisions, such as simulations or offside, showed substantially lower success values (64% and 92%, respectively). Besides, match officials' decisions success was not influenced by the period of the match, tournament phase and score or indeed by the zone of the soccer field. The results obtained suggest the need to include activities based on decision-making skills, mainly in simulations, in training programs to optimize international match officials´ decision making.

Sesenta árbitros internacionales (FR) y asistentes (AR) fueron analizados en este estudio. Las decisiones arbitrales fueron registradas durante 30 partidos de fútbol, pertenecientes a un torneo internacional, los cuales se categorizaron (p.e., FR, AR y otras decisiones) para el posterior análisis. La herramienta ad hoc ARBI.e fue creada por los autores para valorar las decisiones arbitrales. El coeficiente Kappa de Cohen mostró valores desde 0,914 a 1,00 y desde 0,827 a 1,00 para el análisis intra-observador e inter-observador, respectivamente. A pesar del alto nivel de éxito en ambos grupos, FR y AR (95%), algunas decisiones, como las simulaciones o fuera de juego, mostraron un valor de éxito sustancialmente menor (64% y 92%, respectivamente). Por otro lado, el éxito en las decisiones durante los partidos oficiales no estuvo influenciado por el periodo del partido, la fase del torneo y el resultado, ni por la zona del campo en la que tenía lugar la acción.

Based on the results obtained, it can be concluded that to score goals in their offensive actions, the Spanish team starts the play in the central area of the creation sector of the rival pitch and that the ball reaches the forwards, who are responsible for finalizing the attack action. It also follows that increasing the presence of intermediate successes also increases probability of achieving a goal. To achieve these levels of success, the team builds the play through the intervention of 6-7 players, making 6-10 passes during it and giving their action the maximum breadth possible through the use of changes in direction.

Ankle stability is due to a number of mechanisms, such as muscle control between agonists and antagonists, proprioception, balance, and muscle strength. If there are changes in any of these mechanisms, there is an increased risk of ankle injuries. Objective: The purpose of this study was to analyze the ankle function of amateur and professional soccer players in the preseason, using Y Balance Test (YBT) and Dorsiflexion Lunge Test (DLT), observing possible functional deficits in this sample, and subsequently analyzing the relationship of results between the functional tests in this population. Methods: A total of 107 soccer players were assessed, of whom 36 were amateur and 71 professional athletes. The volunteers initially underwent history taking, followed by a 5-minute warm-up on a stationary bicycle then the YBT and DLT functional tests. Results: There was no significant difference in the DLT between dominant and non-dominant limbs in amateur and professional athletes. There was also no significant difference in the YBT between dominant and non-dominant limbs of amateur athletes, but there was a significant difference between dominant and non-dominant limbs in professional athletes. There was no correlation between the tests when the dominant and non-dominant limbs of the sample were analyzed. Conclusion: The weak relationship between the functional tests indicates that both tests are recommended for athletes in clinical practice, since they serve as tools to assess different functional deficits. Level of Evidence III - Case-control study. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR Introducción: El tobillo presenta la mayor incidencia de lesiones en el fútbol (17 a 20% de las lesiones), pudiendo ocasionar perjuicios personales y profesionales para el atleta. La estabilidad del tobillo se debe a una serie de mecanismos, tales como control muscular entre agonistas y antagonistas, propiocepción, equilibrio, y fuerza muscular. En caso que haya alteraciones en alguno de esos mecanismos, hay mayor riesgo de lesiones en el tobillo. El objetivo del presente estudio consistía en analizar la función del tobillo de atletas de fútbol, de las categorías amateur y profesional, en el período de pretemporada, utilizando los tests Y Balance Test (YBT) y Dorsiflexion Lunge Test (DLT), observando posibles déficits funcionales en esa muestra y, posteriormente, analizar la relación de los resultados entre los tests funcionales en esa población. Métodos: Se evaluaron 107 atletas de fútbol, siendo 36 atletas amateurs y 71 atletas profesionales. Los voluntarios pasaron por una anamnesis inicial seguida por un precalentamiento de 5 minutos en bicicleta ergométrica y por los tests funcionales YBT y DLT. Resultados: No hubo diferencia significativa en el DLT entre los miembros dominantes y no dominantes en atletas amateurs y profesionales. Además, no hubo diferencia significativa en el YBT entre miembros dominantes y no dominantes de atletas amateurs, pero hubo diferencia significativa entre los miembros dominantes y no dominantes en atletas profesionales. No hubo correlación entre los tests cuando analizados los miembros dominantes y no dominantes de la muestra. Conclusión: La baja relación entre los tests funcionales indica que la realización de ambos es recomendada para atletas en la práctica clínica, siendo herramientas de evaluación de déficits funcionales distintos.

Networks are constructed based on passes made between players, and several centrality measures are investigated in combination with three different methods for evaluating individual passes. Four seasons of data from the Norwegian top division are used to identify key players and analyze matches from a selected team. The networks examined in this work have weights based on three different aspects of the passes made: their probability of being completed, the probability that the team keeps possession after the completed pass, and the probability of the pass being part of a sequence leading to a shot. The results show that using different metrics and network weights leads to the identification of key passers in different phases of play and in different positions on the pitch.

There are many injury risk factors related to intrinsic (non-modifiable) and/or extrinsic (modifiable) factors of ACL injury. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Research of the studies was conducted until September 2018 without publication data limitation or language restriction on the following databases: PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, ISI, EXCERPTA. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: To date, evidence from the literature suggests that the risk of ACL injury is multifactorial and involves biomechanical, anatomical, hormonal, and neuromuscular factors. Despite this relative complexity, the mechanisms of injury are well known and rationally classified into two categories: mechanisms of injury based on contact or on non-contact with another player, with the non-contact injury mechanisms clearly prevailing over the mechanisms of contact injury. One of the most frequent biomechanical risk factors, associated with ACL non-contact injury, is represented by the valgus knee in the pivoting and cutting movements and in the landing phase after jumping. Gender-related risk factors show female populations to have a higher predisposition to ACL injury than males However, there are still some theoretical and practical aspects that need further investigation such as; genetic risks together with the role of estrogen and progesterone receptors in female populations, and the in-vivo interaction shoe-playing surface. In particular, the genetic risk factors of ACL lesion seem to be an interesting and promising field of investigation, where considerable progress has still to be made. CONCLUSIONS: This narrative review provides an insight into the risk factors of ACL injury that could be used by practitioners for preventing injury in football (soccer).","2019","2020-05-20 00:08:06","2020-05-20 00:08:06","","1724-1738","","10","59","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L627708013; http://dx.doi.org/10.23736/S0022-4707.19.09563-X","human; football; injury; pathophysiology; anterior cruciate ligament injury; knee injury; risk factor","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Determining these characteristics may likely assist in evaluating the specificity of current training programmes, identify players who might lack specific qualities deemed critical for the successful execution of their tactical roles, and benchmark norms for developing future playing talent. Therefore, the aims of this study were to describe anthropometric and motor characteristics of South African national level female soccer players (n = 37) and determine possible differences with regard to their playing position. The following measurements and tests were performed: anthropometry (body mass index and sum-of-skinfolds), the countermovement jump, sprints (10 m, 20 m and 40 m), upper body muscle endurance (push-ups) and the Yo-Yo Intermittent Recovery Test - level 1. One-way analysis of variance revealed few differences in the main outcome variables. Fischer Least Significant Difference (LSD) showed that strikers had a greater body mass index than midfielders and defenders (both p = 0.04) and goalkeepers were heavier than defenders (p = 0.02). Goalkeepers were slower than strikers and defenders over 10 m (p = 0.01; p = 0.03) and 20 m (p = 0.001; p = 0.01). Midfielders were slower than strikers over 20 m (p = 0.02), and with strikers and defenders over 40 m (both p = 0.04). Defenders performed better than goalkeepers in the upper body muscle endurance test (p = 0.02). In conclusion, both strikers and defenders require speed to win ball possession, which may explain their fast sprint times. However, the similarity of certain motor characteristics across playing positions may suggest that conditioning coaches train players similarly, irrespective of their tactical position. The authors suggest that South African fitness professionals, particularly at a club level, develop physical conditioning programs specific to each field position. Furthermore, fitness assessments should occur on a continuous basis and comparisons should be made with existing normative data in order to guide the development of players over the course of their careers.

Research data was collected by measuring 29 Polish Football Premier League players, native to Poland. Anthropometric and biochemical data were collected in December. Mean body height is similar to that of world elite soccer players. Trunk, lower, and upper extremity girths measured indicate a well-developed musculature. Body composition analysis identified a mean fat percentage of 18±3.0%. A high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was observed in the sample. Mean serum 25(OH)D3 concentration for the group was 18.3±4.4ng/mL. Significant positive correlations between 25(OH)D3 and anthropometric variables characterising body musculature and skeletal size may show the indirect impact of vitamin D on the development and function of these respective systems.

A total of 618 Greek soccer players who were grouped by age (i.e., 12–14, 14–16, 16–18, and 18–37 years) and playing position (i.e., goalkeeper, defender, midfielder, and forward) were evaluated for weight, height, and skinfolds. The Pařízková formula was used to estimate the percentage of body fat. Furthermore, for players who were 18 years or older the Reilly and Evans formulas was used to estimate the percentage of body fat. Independent of the age, in this large sample, goalkeepers presented higher values for weight, height and the percentage of body fat estimation as compared with other field positions. An anthropometric pattern was observed in each tactical position, namely, across a specific age of increasing maturation process (14–16 years). With the Pařízková formula, we found a mean (SD) range of variation in the percentage of body fat estimation between 4.87 ± 1.46 and 5.51 ± 1.46 as compared with the Evans formula. The same pattern of differences was found when the Reilly equation was considered. In conclusion, we observed a position specificity of anthropometric characteristics across different age categories. Additionally, the same data supported different validated equations which resulted in large differences in the final outcome estimations.","2019","2020-05-20 00:08:10","2020-05-20 00:08:10","","","","13","16","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph16132386; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002230292","adult; human; article; soccer player; controlled study; adolescent; height; anthropometry; body fat; groups by age; maturation; skinfold thickness","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: Twenty-one football athletes were randomly assigned to two groups: placebo and antioxidant-supplemented. Supplementation was performed in a double-blind, controlled manner using vitamin C (500 mg/d) and E (400 UI/d) for 15 d. After 7 d of supplementation, athletes were submitted to an exercise-induced oxidative stress protocol consisting of plyometric jumping and strength resistance sets to exhaustion. Blood samples, performance tests, and DOMS were determined before and 24, 48, and 72 h after exercise. Results: Antioxidant supplementation was continued during the recuperation week and for a total of 15 d. Antioxidant supplementation caused a significant increase in plasma vitamins C and E. The antioxidant supplementation could inhibit oxidative stress characterized by elevated lipid peroxidation markers malondialdehyde and total lipid peroxidation as well as reduced ratio of glutathione to oxidized glutathione promoted by exercise. Antioxidant supplementation, however, did not significantly reduce the plasma creatine kinesis concentration or DOMS during the recovery days. Likewise, supplementation with vitamin C and E did not improve lower body power, agility, or anaerobic power, nor did it provide any indication of faster muscle recovery. Conclusion: Antioxidant supplementation does not attenuate elevated markers of muscle damage or muscle soreness promoted by acute exercise and do not exert any ergogenic effect on football performance of young athletes, although it reduced oxidative stress.","2019","2020-05-20 00:08:10","2020-05-20 00:08:10","","29-35","","","63-64","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2019.01.007; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2001733918","adult; football player; human; human experiment; male; article; football; exercise; priority journal; controlled study; young adult; blood sampling; randomized controlled trial; resistance training; agility; normal human; athletic performance; alpha tocopherol; antioxidant; ascorbic acid; creatine kinase; creatine kinase blood level; delayed onset muscle soreness; double blind procedure; exhaustion; glutathione; glutathione disulfide; jumping; lipid peroxidation; malonaldehyde; muscle disease; muscle injury; oxidative stress; plyometrics; vitamin supplementation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It has been hypothesized that the hemodynamic load during exercise may also lead to aortic remodeling. The rest of the cardiac adaptations induced by athletic conditioning have been the subject of numerous studies, but investigations of the aorta in athletes have been limited and is rather vague whether the hemodynamic overload during chronic exercise training affects aortic root dimensions, or at least to the extent that the rest of the cardiac chambers are affected. Adolescent athletes (14 to 17 years old) comprise the largest cohort of exercise individuals throughout the world. At the same time they are the most vulnerable subgroup of athletes to exercise-related sudden cardiac death. Methods 1035 individuals, males and females were included in the study. These individuals were footballers, scholars, and trained from 7 to 11 years. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed by either a trained sonographer or a cardiologist. All views obtained and measurements performed were according to the protocols specified by the British Society of Echocardiography, the European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging and the American Society of Echocardiography. With regards to aortic dimensions, images were obtained from a parasternal long axis view and measurements were performed from two-dimensional images. The aortic root diameters were measured in 2-dimensional mode at two levels (ie the sinuses of Valsalva and the ascending aorta). Results Male footballers were 945 (91.31%) while female footballers were 90 (8.69%). The mean value and the standard deviation of the age, the morphologic parameters, the aortic root diameters and two basic left heart dimensions (left ventricular end diastolic diameter and left atrium size) are presented in table 1. The mean values of age, height, weight, BMI, BSA were significantly lower in females than in males. The mean values of the two aortic diameters as well as the LA volume and LV end diastolic diameter were also greater in males than in females. There was statistically significant difference in all the parameters. Nomograms allowing determination of the Z score for the aortic diameters as a function of gender and BSA, at the level of the sinuses of Valsalva and at the level of the ascending aorta were plotted. Conclusion: We have proposed a new tool for the recognition of aortic root dilatation in adolescent athletes from 14 to 17 years old. It can be used at the levels of the sinuses of Valsalva and the ascending aorta. Nomograms for these diameters are of utmost importance for diagnostic purposes, for the differentiation of normal growth from pathologic aortic dilatation and for decision making including the determination of the optimal time for surgical intervention (Figure Presented) .","2019","2020-05-20 00:08:12","2020-05-20 00:08:12","","i1026","","","20","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ehjci/jey273; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L630841677","conference abstract; female; football player; human; male; exercise; controlled study; major clinical study; adolescent; body mass; cohort analysis; gender; nomogram; decision making; sudden cardiac death; transthoracic echocardiography; aortic root; aortic sinus; artery dilatation; ascending aorta; cardiologist; heart left atrium; heart left ventricle enddiastolic diameter; hemodynamics; sonographer; structure activity relation; surgery","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, under such circumstances, all kinds of science and technology have been promoted to be widely applied in all fields, and eventually to be widely popularized. Under this background, in the field of education in our country, with the in-depth popularization of Internet information technology, the era of multimedia education has thus emerged. Micro-video transmits information to the outside world through multimedia methods such as images, animations and pictures. Due to its short, precise and fast characteristics, micro-video is more suitable for people's needs in the current fast pace of life. Under such circumstances, this technology has been widely and effectively applied in the field of education. On the basis of in-depth reform of the education system, the teaching mode of micro-class video has also been applied to school physical education. Methods: Students can also feedback their knowledge to teachers through micro-videos. In this case, teachers can give targeted guidance to students' actions. Such as WeChat video, which is widely used at present, after-class exercises can effectively improve the training level of students, and correct and efficient learning guidance for students through micro video can not only improve the training level of students, but also increase the affection between teachers and students. Results: For this reason, this paper first makes an in-depth analysis of the advantages of micro-video resources teaching, and then makes a detailed exploration of the application of micro-video resources in football classroom teaching and technical teaching on this basis, hoping to lay a foundation for the continuous improvement of football teaching effectiveness and quality, the improvement of students' learning enthusiasm and the long-term development of football. Conclusions: In general, the reasonable application of micro-video resources to sports football teaching can enrich the teaching content of sports courses, which plays a positive and auxiliary role in both theoretical teaching and practical teaching. This teaching method can more effectively stimulate students' interest in learning sports football, improve students' learning ability, reduce teachers' teaching pressure to varying degrees, and improve teachers' teaching effect and quality. It is a scientific and technological teaching method used by non-value educators.","2019","2020-05-20 00:08:13","2020-05-20 00:08:13","","68-69","","SUPPL, 9","125","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L631567213","conference abstract; human; human experiment; theoretical study; football; exercise; sport; learning; multimedia; teacher; teaching; videorecording","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Mixed-linear modelling was used to determine within-season changes in YYIRL1 performance and between- and within-player variation over four years, at four time points (July, September, December and May) in 86 players (459 observations), mean age 13 ± standard deviation 1.8 years, 0.9 ± 1.5 years from peak height velocity. Twenty-three players, tested over three consecutive years were retained for further analysis. Magnitude-based inferences were used to quantify annual change in performance on a group and individual level. Within-player correlations were used to determine the association between YYIRL1 and maturation. 'Very likely' small (14, ±90% confidence interval 8.1–20%) improvements were observed between July and September and 'possibly' trivial (5.5, 0.41–11%) differences between September and May. Within-player variation throughout the in-season period, representing the typical error of the estimate was 23%, 22–25% and between-player, 38, 33–44%. We observed 'most likely' moderate improvements (32, 17–49%) over three years that were moderately associated with changes in maturation (r = 0.46, 0.13 to 0.70). A minimum change of ≥44% is required to detect 'likely' improvements in YYIRL1 performance on an individual basis.

Thirty-six male collegiate team-sport (23 Rugby/13 Soccer) athletes (age: 20 ± 1.4 years; height: 1.80 ± 0.08 m; mass: 83 ± 13.2 kg) participated in the study. Each athlete performed 3 trials of a 20-m sprint (with 5 and 10 m splits) and 2 change of direction (COD) tests (90° cut and 505 tests) cutting/turning from both legs. Completion times for all sprint and COD tests were measured using timing cells. For both COD tests, CODD was determined (COD completion time-10 m sprint time). Pearson correlation was used to explore the relationships between sprint times and CODD and completion times. Significant (p < 0.001) moderate-to-large (r ≥ 0.467) correlations between sprint times and 90° cut completion times for left and right cuts were observed. Nonsignificant (p > 0.05) trivial-to-small correlations (r ≤ 0.199) were found between sprint variables and 90° cut CODD. Significant (p < 0.001) large to very large correlations (r ≥ 0.531) were revealed between the left and right 90° cut and 90° cut CODD. The results suggest that the CODD could be applied to isolate and assess the cutting ability in COD speed tests that involve a single cutting maneuver. Failure to inspect CODD could lead to incorrect evaluation of an athletes cutting or COD ability.","2019","2020-05-20 00:08:15","2020-05-20 00:08:15","","2138-2144","","8","33","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1519/JSC.0000000000002346; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628924775","human; male; football; soccer; adolescent; athlete; young adult; physiology; cross-sectional study; procedures; exercise test; athletic performance; physical examination","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the case of football, this technique has not yet been sufficiently proven. The aim of the present study was to search for different success models for the corners in the FIFA World Cup 2014 and FIFA Women’s World Cup 2015. For this, the statistical analysis focused on the search for classification models for the different criteria considered (shot, shot between the three posts and goal), based on the creation of different decision trees that allow the most important variables to be identified quickly and efficiently. For this, 1117 corners were collected between the two competitions, performed in 116 international matches. It has been possible to establish multivariate models for the ""shot"" and ""shot between the three posts"" criteria, allowing, in some cases, to quadruple the potential for offensive success. On the other hand, we have been able to identify significant differences in the male and female model of execution. These findings suggest the need to continue deepening the study of tactical behavior in women’s soccer from a multivariate perspective, and also propose a better optimization of the management and training of this type of actions for both male and female football. In addition, it has allowed to test the decision tree statistical technique in the analysis of high performance football, with satisfactory results and of great relevance in the applied field.","2019","2020-05-20 00:08:16","2020-05-20 00:08:16","","","","3","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0212549; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2001693322","adult; female; human; human experiment; male; article; football; soccer; competition; decision tree; statistical analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ecological models of education seek, among other things, to make up for this deficit by modifying the structural elements of sport, bringing play closer to the child's developmental characteristics. In this sense, Nonlinear Pedagogy is a model of active pedagogy that seeks the integral development of young players through a sport more in line with their abilities, and that for this is based on a system of constraints on the environment, the task and the player himself. However, there are no studies that analyze the effects of these methodologies on the parameters of physical activity at such an early age. The aim of this study was to analyze the impact of a learning methodology based on Nonlinear Pedagogy on health-related levels of physical activity (heart rate) in young football players (U-11). A quasi-experimental study was developed in which three tasks were applied using structural modifications of the football elements related to Nonlinear Pedagogy (modification of the number of players related to situations of inferiority, equality and numerical superiority; dimensions of the field of play). The sample studied was composed of football players, U-11 n = 32), age: 10.35 ± 0.54 years; years of experience: 2.14 ± 0.768 years. The players carried out each task for 10 min. Physical activity levels were measured by controlling heart rate using heart rate monitors (Polar Team2). The results showed very high levels of vigorous and very vigorous physical activity in all the tasks designed. These data show that the use of these new teaching methodologies has an impact on levels of physical activity in accordance with the recommended parameters.","2019","2020-05-20 00:08:17","2020-05-20 00:08:17","","","","FEB","10","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2019.00121; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L627780325","football player; human; human experiment; article; soccer; clinical article; heart rate; physical activity; controlled study; physiology; juvenile; learning; child; school child; teaching; pedagogics; quasi experimental study","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

OBJECTIVE: Describe lower body injury patterns and determine whether a screening hip physical examination is predictive of future injuries in elite adolescent female soccer athletes. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: One United States premier soccer club. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred seventy-seven female soccer athletes ages 10-18 years old (mean 14.6±1.8 years) completed a demographic questionnaire and screening hip physical examination which included range of motion and provocative tests. INTERVENTIONS: At least five years after baseline screening, athletes completed an electronic follow-up injury survey. Injury was defined as pain that interfered with sporting activity. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): In addition to descriptive analyses of athletes' injury profiles, associations between players' baseline demographics and subsequent injury profiles were evaluated using chi-square tests, and potential predictors of injury based on players' baseline hip examinations were evaluated using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Ninety-four of 177 athletes (53%) were contacted for follow-up, and 88/94 (93.6%) completed the survey. With mean follow-up of 91.9±9.3 months (range 66-108 months), 42/88 (47.7%) reported sustaining a new lower body injury. The low back was the most commonly injury region (16/42, 38.1%). Almost half of all injured athletes (20/42, 47.6%) sustained overuse injuries, and 16/42 (38.1%) had an incomplete recovery. Higher body mass index and reaching menarche were associated with sustaining an injury (p=0.03 and 0.04, respectively). Athletes' baseline hip examinations were not predictive of their subsequent rate of lower body, lumbopelvic, overuse, or incomplete recovery injury (all p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Lower body injuries were common in elite adolescent female soccer athletes, with over one third of injured athletes reporting permanent negative impact of the injury on their playing ability.

Risk factors for head, neck and face injuries (HNFI) have not yet been examined prospectively in rugby-7 s. The aim was to examine whether rugby-specific injury factors, age, playing-positions, contact aspects, and play legality, playing differences, are risk factors for HNFI between men and women U.S. rugby-7 s players. Methods: Prospective cohort data, under-18 (U18) to elite players from the Rugby Injury Survey and Evaluation (RISERugby) injury registry. Anthropometric data, mechanism, and rugby-specific injury factors were tabulated by HNFI and sex. Logistic regression determined the relation between sex and HNFI. A final multivariable model calculated probability of HNFI and differences between sex. Results: The final study sample consisted of 1,307 (68.2 % men, 31.8 % women) U.S. rugby-7s players and 1,679 (68.1 % men, 31.9 % women) injuries. From 2010-2016, 474 (28.2 %) HNFI were documented. The head (47.7 %) was most commonly injured and injury type were concussions (40.3%). Significant differences in the distribution of HNFI were observed between positions during impact (p< 0.001), play legality (p = 0.010), and among impact surfaces (p< 0.001). When stratified by sex, significant differences were found among age categories (p = 0.003), reported mouthguard use (p< 0.001) and scrumcap wear (p< 0.001), field type (p = 0.001), and impact surface (p = 0.028). The distribution of HNFI did not differ between sexes (p = 0.230). The final model revealed controlling for play legality and position during contact, U18-males injured during contact with an opposing player had the highest probability of HNFI (51 %; p = 0.004) than U18-females. However, women 18-24 (p = 0.006) and over 30 years old (p = 0.010), had a higher probability of HNFI during contact with the ground, than men. Discussion: There are sex differences in the risk of HNFI, however, this relationship is mediated by age and play legality. High school-aged (U18) male players involved in contact with players, whether tackles or collisions were most at risk for a HNFI. Meanwhile, adult women players, U18 to college-aged and older than 30 years old, had a higher risk of HNFI encountered with playing surface impacts. Future age-group analyses may help identify further sex-specific HNFI risk factors. The tackle techniques employed by developing players and between player interactions, including tackles or collisions should be reviewed in detail for injury reduction. Identifying sex-specific risk factors of HNFI may allow for a more efficacious injury prevention plans addressing individual needs of men and women.","2019","2020-05-20 00:08:18","2020-05-20 00:08:18","","S27-S28","","","22","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsams.2019.08.186; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002914859","adult; conference abstract; female; human; male; rugby; clinical article; prospective study; cohort analysis; concussion; high school; sex difference; age; risk factor; accident prevention; face injury; mouth protector; neck injury; probability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Implications for talent identification and development","International Journal of Sports Science & Coaching","","17479541","","","The identification and development of talent is an essential component of modern professional football. The recognition of key physical characteristics of such footballers who successfully progress through talent development programs is of considerable interest to academics and those working in professional football. Using Football Yearbooks, we obtained the height, body mass and ages of all players from the English top-division over the seasons 1973–4, 1983–4, 1993–4, 2003–4 and 2013–4, calculating body-mass index (BMI) (kg/m2) and reciprocal ponderal index (RPI) (cm/kg0.333). The mean squad size increased over these decades from n = 22.4 (1973–4) to n = 27.8 (2013–4). Height also increased linearly by approximately 1.2 cm per decade. Body mass increased in the first four decades, but declined in the final season (2013–4). Regression analysis confirmed inverted ""u"" shape trends in both body mass and BMI, but a ""J"" shape trend in RPI, indicating that English top-division professional footballers are getting more angular and ectomorphic. We speculate that this recent decline in BMI and rise in RPI is due to improved quality of pitches and increased work-load required by modern-day players. Defenders were also found to be significantly taller, heavier, older and, assuming BMI is positively associated with lean mass, more muscular than other midfielders or attackers. The only characteristic that consistently differentiated successful with less successful players/teams was age (being younger). Therefore, English professional clubs might be advised to attract young, less muscular, more angular/ectomorphic players as part of their talent identification and development programs to improve their chances of success.

In a crossover study, 8 soccer (age: 16 ± 2 years, body mass: 68.5 ± 10.5 kg, height: 1.69 ± 0.4 m, relative body fat mass: 22.4 ± 6.5%) and 8 futsal (age: 16 ± 1 years, body mass: 67.7 ± 8.4 kg, height: 1.70 ± 0.4 m, relative body fat mass: 21.0 ± 6.1%) goalkeepers randomly performed TT and ST on both surfaces. All comparisons were adjusted for body mass and relative body fat mass. Results. Surface had a slight effect (0.066 d 0.163) on agility in both tests irrespective of the sport (TT grass: 10.90 ± 1.04 s, TTwood: 10.80 ± 0.96 s, STgrass: 5.82 ± 0.32 s, STwood: 5.87 ± 0.36 s, p > 0.05). No differences were found in agility performance between soccer (TTgrass: 11.10 ± 0.23 s, TTwood: 11.10 ± 0.28 s, STgrass: 5.75 ± 0.08 s, STwood: 5.85 ± 0.14 s) and futsal (TTgrass: 10.60 ± 1.07 s, TTwood: 10.50 ± 0.90 s, STgrass: 5.81 ± 0.31 s, STwood: 5.84 ± 0.31 s) goalkeepers, regardless of the test or surface (p > 0.05). There were strong relationships among the conditions (0.69 r 0.96). Moreover, the tests applied on different surfaces systematically produced similar results, and interchange of test surfaces was supported by parallel reliability. Conclusions. Surface effect for both tests does not seem enough to induce statistical differences in the agility of soccer and futsal young male goalkeepers. Goalkeepers' agility performances were similar in both sports.

It is unknown whether these observations extend to prior strength-type sports exposure. The primary aim of this study was to compare AF prevalence in former National Football League (NFL) athletes to population-based controls. The secondary aim was to characterize other conduction system parameters. Methods and Results: This cross-sectional study compared former NFL athletes (n=460, age 56±12 years, black 47%) with population-based controls of similar age and racial composition from the cardiovascular cohort Dallas Heart Study-2 (n=925, age 54±9 years, black 53%). AF was present in 28 individuals (n=23 [5%] in the NFL group; n=5 [0.5%] in the control group). After controlling for other cardiovascular risk factors in multivariable regression analysis, former NFL participation remained associated with a 5.7 (95% CI: 2.1–15.9, P<0.001) higher odds ratio of AF. Older age, higher body mass index, and nonblack race were also independently associated with higher odds ratio of AF, while hypertension and diabetes mellitus were not. AF was previously undiagnosed in 15/23 of the former NFL players. Previously undiagnosed NFL players were rate controlled and asymptomatic, but 80% had a CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥1. Former NFL players also had an 8-fold higher prevalence of paced cardiac rhythms (2.0% versus 0.25%, P<0.01), compared with controls. Furthermore, former athletes had lower resting heart rates (62±11 versus 66±11 beats per minute, P<0.001), and a higher prevalence of first-degree atrioventricular block (18% versus 9%, P<0.001). Conclusions: Former NFL participation was associated with an increased AF prevalence and slowed cardiac conduction when compared with a population-based control group. Former NFL athletes who screened positive for AF were generally rate controlled and asymptomatic, but 80% should have been considered for anticoagulation based on their stroke risk.","2019","2020-05-20 00:08:21","2020-05-20 00:08:21","","","","15","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1161/JAHA.118.010401; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2003605101","adult; female; football player; human; male; article; heart beat; heart rate; priority journal; major clinical study; athlete; body mass; cohort analysis; cross-sectional study; prevalence; age; cardiovascular risk; atrioventricular block; Black person; CHA2DS2-VASc score; diabetes mellitus; heart arrhythmia; heart muscle conduction system; heart rhythm; hypertension; middle aged; odds ratio; race difference; rest","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, surgical strategy for shoulder instability is a challenging and controversial problem for surgeons that have to treat collision sport athletes. In fact, only few studies support the arthroscopic surgery for this group of patients. The aim of this study is to evaluate the outcome of arthroscopic stabilization in a homogenous population of professional young athletes practicing in high-level collision sport. We treated 22 consecutive professional rugby players, with a mean age of 23.6 years, affected by traumatic anterior shoulder instability. All patients underwent arthroscopic Bankart repair with bone suture-anchors. Exclusion criteria were: failed previous shoulder surgery, atraumatic, multidirectional or posterior instability, bone defects greater than 20% of the anterior-inferior glenoid, engaging Hill-Sachs, rotator cuff tears, capsular-ligament avulsion on the humeral side (HAGL). Patients were evaluated according to Constant score, Rowe score and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for discomfort and handicap. The mean follow-up was 40.7 months (range, 6 to 87 months). All patients except one were able to return at the same previous sports level at 5 to 6 months postoperatively. Re-dislocation occurred in 3 players for high impact trauma during competition or training. Our results confirm that, also in the collision sport patients, anatomic arthroscopic Bankart repair is a good option for the treatment of traumatic anterior instability without associated lesions.","2019","2020-05-20 00:08:25","2020-05-20 00:08:25","","15-20","","1","33","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002545653","adult; human; male; article; rugby; clinical article; adolescent; retrospective study; professional athlete; arthroscopic surgery; Bankart lesion; patient satisfaction; recurrent shoulder dislocation; Rowe score; shoulder arthroscopy; shoulder surgery; suture anchor; visual analog scale","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Overhead contact sports such as gaelic football and hurling pose a unique hazard to the glenohumeral joint, increasing the risk of dislocation. Aims: To assess return to sport, level of play, recurrence and functional outcomes in gaelic football and hurling athletes in comparison with players of other sports. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was carried out from 2007 to 2016. Follow-up was conducted via telephone interview using the Western Ontario Shoulder Instability Index (WOSI) score used to assess functional outcomes as well as return to sport, level of return and recurrence. Results: Ninety patients were included with follow-up which was obtained on 61 patients (68%) with a mean follow-up of 5.04 years. 91.8% played sport at the time of injury, 55.4% of those (31 patients) played a gaelic sport with 44.6% (25 patients) playing other sports. 76.8% returned to their sport, 80.4% of these able to return at their pre-injury level. Recurrence occurred in 10 patients (16.4%). WOSI scores were not significantly different between groups (p = 0.77). No significance in recurrence between groups was noted (p = 0.78). Discussion: Favourable outcomes can be expected for overhead contact sport athletes undergoing anterior arthroscopic stabilisation for recurrent instability. Players from these groups returned to sport sooner than those from other sports and no difference in recurrence was noted. The level at which they can expect to return to is favourable with most athletes reaching their pre-injury level.","2019","2020-05-20 00:08:26","2020-05-20 00:08:26","","1233-1237","","4","188","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L626399681; http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11845-019-01986-w","adult; female; human; male; article; football; major clinical study; return to sport; scoring system; sport; adolescent; athlete; cohort analysis; follow up; retrospective study; arthroscopic surgery; recurrent shoulder dislocation; hurling; shoulder; telephone interview; Western Ontario Shoulder Instability Index","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although arthroscopic soft tissue stabilization is widely accepted treatment for traumatic anterior shoulder instability, many surgeons prefer coracoid transfer such as Latarjet procedure for collision athletes with or without glenoid defect due to potential high recurrence rate after arthroscopic soft tissue Bankart repair (ABR). In the meantime, Hill-Sachs remplissage (HSR) has been gaining popularity as an effective arthroscopic augmentation procedure. Since 2002, we performed rotator interval closure (RIC) as an augmentation in addition to ABR or arthroscopic bony Bankart repair (ABBR) for collision athletes and obtained satisfactory outcome. However, teen players demonstrated higher recurrence rate compared to twenties and thirties. Therefore, from 2012, we performed HSR as an additional augmentation for teen players besides ABR/ABBR and RIC. The purpose of this study was to assess the outcomes after arthroscopic stabilization in collision athletes who underwent shoulder stabilization under our treatment strategy. Methods: Between 2012 through 2015, 95 consecutive collision athletes underwent shoulder stabilization. Among those, only 2 patients (2%) underwent arthroscopic bony procedure for poor capsular integrity. Among the remaining 93 patients who underwent soft tissue stabilization, 65 were available for minimum 2-year follow-up (70%). Therefore, subjects consisted of 65 players including 54 rugby and 11 American football players (Table 1). There were 13 national top league, 24 collegiate, 21 junior or senior high school, and 7 recreational players. The mean age at surgery was 20 years (range, 16-36). The mean follow-up was 37 months (range, 24-64). We retrospectively reviewed intraoperative findings and surgical procedures using patient records including surgical reports and videos. We also investigated functional outcome and recurrence rate. Pre- and postoperative Rowe scores were compared using paired t test. Results: Preoperative 3DCT of the glenoid demonstrated bony Bankart (fragment type) in 43 players (66 %), attritional type in 16 (25%), and normal glenoid in 6 (9 %). Mean glenoid bone loss was 15 % (range, 0-25) and all of the glenoid with more than 10% bone loss retained bony fragment. All 65 players demonstrated Bankart lesion and 15 had concomitant SLAP lesion (23%) which required to be repaired. In addition, 5 players demonstrated capsule tear (8%), which were also repaired. Twenty-four players (36%) underwent ABR or ABBR with RIC and forty one players (64%) underwent ABR or ABBR combined with HSR (Table 1). The mean Rowe score significantly improved after surgery from 65 (range, 55-75) to 92 (range, 65-100) (P < .001). Recurrence appeared in 2 cases (3 %), both of which were junior or senior high school players who underwent ABR with HSR. Ten national top league players who underwent ABR with RIC had no recurrence. Conclusion: Soft tissue stabilization combined with selective augmentation procedures for traumatic shoulder instability in collision athletes demonstrated satisfactory outcomes with extremely low recurrence rate. Since the incidence of having bony Bankart lesion in collision athletes was very high, arthroscopic bony Bankart repair worked in many patients even with significant glenoid bone loss. Further, Hill-Sachs remplissage seemed to be effective additional augmentation especially in young collision athletes.","2019","2020-05-20 00:08:27","2020-05-20 00:08:27","","","","3","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2325967119S00192; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L627390208","adult; conference abstract; female; human; male; football; rugby; incidence; major clinical study; adolescent; athlete; young adult; follow up; high school; retrospective study; clinical assessment; surgery; videorecording; Bankart lesion; recurrent shoulder dislocation; Rowe score; glenoid cavity; medical record; osteolysis; recurrence risk; soft tissue; surgical technique","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is seen especially in professional soccer, with a marked negative impact on team performance and considerable costs of rehabilitation for players. Existing studies provide some preliminary understanding of which factors are mostly associated with injury risk, but scientific systematic evaluation of the potential of statistical models in forecasting injuries is still missing. Some factors raise the risk of a sport injury, but there are also elements that predispose athletes to sports injuries. The biological mechanisms involved in non-contact musculoskeletal soft tissue injuries are poorly understood. Genetic risk factors may be associated with susceptibility to injuries, and may exert marked influence on recovery times. Athletes are complex systems, and depend on internal and external factors to attain and maintain stability of their health and their performance. Organisms, participants or traits within a dynamic system adapt and change when factors within that system change. Scientists routinely predict risk in a variety of dynamic systems, including weather, political forecasting and projecting traffic fatalities and the last years have started the use of predictive models in the human health industry. We propose that the use of artificial intelligence may well help in assessing risk and help to predict the occurrence of sport injuries.","2019","2020-05-20 00:08:28","2020-05-20 00:08:28","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.injury.2019.08.033; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002722211","adult; human; article; soccer; sport injury; controlled study; prediction; risk assessment; forecasting; artificial intelligence; big data; biological product; fatality; genetic association; genetic risk; machine learning; scientist; soft tissue injury; weather","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The length of time in which the team plays under each of these two modes will depend on who the rival team is and the technical play developed. Once the match is over, an analysis of the team's performance is necessary to determine which aspects of the offensive/defensive strategies used during the game failed and which succeeded. Although there are some studies in the literature that assess the offensive and defensive efficiencies of football teams in a season, none of them deal with the performance in a single match. In this paper, a multiple modes of functioning (MMF) data envelopment analysis (DEA) model is proposed. This methodology determines the percentage of time in which the team should have played in defensive and offensive modes in order to maximize those efficiencies. The procedure has been applied to the Spanish First Division league in the 2014/2015 season.

Previous studies of rugby place kicking technique have typically assessed performance based on ball velocity, but this is not the sole requirement. Therefore, a mathematical model of rugby place kick ball flight was developed to yield a single measure more representative of true performance. The model, which requires only initial ball flight kinematics, was calibrated and validated using empirical place kick data, and found to predict ball position with a mean error of 4.0% after 22 m of ball flight. The model was then applied to the performances of 33 place kickers. The predicted maximum distance, a single performance measure which accounted for initial ball velocity magnitude and direction, and spin, was determined using the model and was compared against ball velocity magnitude. A moderate association in the rank-order of the kicks between these two measures (ρ = 0.52) revealed that the relative success of the kicks would be assessed differently with each measure. The developed model provides a representative measure of place kick performance that is understandable for coaches, and can be used to predict changes in performance outcome under different ball launch or environmental conditions.

A novel collision sport simulator was developed to study tackle performance. The main aim of this validation study was to assess tackle technique performance between two different conditions: simulator versus a standardised one-on-one tackle drill previously used to assess technique. Tackling proficiency was assessed using a list of technical criteria. Mean scores, standard deviations and Cohen's d effect sizes were calculated. Mean overall score for dynamic i.e. running simulator tackles was 7.78 (95%CI 7.58-7.99) (out of 9) or 87% (standard deviation or SD±8.94), and mean overall score for dynamic ""live"" tackles was 7.85 (95%CI 7.57-8.13) (out of 9) or 87% (SD±9.60) (effect size = 0.08; trivial; p > 0.05). Mean overall score for static i.e. standing simulator tackles was 7.45 (95%CI 7.20-7.69) (out of 9) or 83% (SD±10.71), and mean overall score for static ""live"" tackles was 8.05 (95%CI 7.83-8.27) (out of 9) or 89% (SD±7.53) (effect size = 0.72; moderate; p < 0.001). The simulator replicates dynamic tackle technique comparable to real-life tackle drills. It may be used for research analysing various aspects of the tackle in rugby and other contact sports.

Since season 1995/96, LaLiga changed the number of points given to the winning teams, by awarding three points per victory instead of two. In this paper, we assess the impact of such a change on the competitive balance of LaLiga. Our analysis focuses on teams with varying levels of performance and follows a three-step approach. First, we cluster the teams according to their historical performance using an adjusted measure based on their credible intervals of winning ratios. Second, we calculate Kendall's tau coefficient (according to our adjusted measure) in order to obtain the overall ranking turnover of teams between consecutive seasons. Third, we assess the causal impact of the adoption of the new scoring system, based on Kendall's tau coefficients, for each cluster of teams. Our results show that the overall competitive balance decreased after the adoption of the new scoring system. However, the impact was not the same for all teams, being more significant for top teams and less significant for bottom teams. Moreover, our predictions using adjusted ARIMA models indicate that this difference in the competitive balance will persist for future seasons.

A test was run in order to show how the GoMeSy platform could be used by coaches to evaluate the penalty shot-stopping skills of goalkeepers, consequently, the performance of 22 players was measured. In the case of the cognitive skills, there is not a significant difference between novice and expert goalkeepers (p = 0.333), meanwhile, in the case of the motor skills, there is a significant difference (p = 0.006). In addition, there is a moderate, positive correlation between weight and motion time (r = 0.437). In general, this study demonstrates that the GoMeSy platform allows coaches to evaluate with accuracy the penalty shot-stopping skills of goalkeepers. The findings of the test emphasize the fact that coaches do not have to focus only on the goalkeepers' physical training (motor skills), but they should also consider developing the reaction time (cognitive skills). The results also highlight that although the body mass index depends on the height and weight of each subject, coaches should focus primarily on monitoring the weight of players to improve their performance.

Design: Descriptive, observational. Methods: Twenty-nine international women's rugby union players wore 10 Hz microelectromechanical systems during eight international matches (110 observations). Total, and per-half, distances were recorded, whilst relative total and high-speed (>4.4 m s−1) distances were averaged using FIXED and ROLL methods over 60–600-s. Linear mixed models compared distances covered between match halves, assessed FIXED versus ROLL, and examined the influence of playing position. Results: Players covered ∼5.8 km match−1, with reduced distances in the second- versus first-half (p < 0.001). For worst-case scenario total (∼8–25%) and high-speed (∼10–26%) distance, FIXED underestimated ROLL. In ROLL, worst-case scenario relative total and high-speed distances reduced from ∼144−161 m min−1 and ∼30−69 m min−1 over 60-s, to ∼80 89 m min−1 and ∼5 16 m min−1 in the 600-s epoch, respectively. Forwards performed less high-speed running over all epochs and covered less total distance during epochs of 60-s, 180-s, 420-s and 480-s, compared with backs. Front row players typically returned the lowest locomotor demands. Conclusions: This is the first study reporting the positional and worst-case scenario demands of international women's rugby union, and indicates an underestimation in FIXED versus ROLL over 60-s to 600-s epochs. Knowledge of the most demanding periods of women's rugby union match-play facilitates training specificity by enabling sessions to be tailored to such demands.","2019","2020-05-20 00:08:35","2020-05-20 00:08:35","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsams.2019.12.016; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2004369303","adult; female; human; human experiment; article; rugby; clinical article; controlled study; team sport; running; velocity; fatigue; microelectromechanical system","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

After analyzing the results obtained in September, we proceeded to plan an individual training program for each player in relation to their physical condition (Gualtieri et al, 2006), and at the end of the season the test was repeated to observe any improvements. The study takes into account two different football seasons: the 2017 - 2018 season in which the aerobic resistance was assessed through the MOPER test and the 2018 - 2019 season where the Gacon test was considered. From the analysis of the results it is possible to observe the improvements obtained by the young players; in fact the comparison of the MOPER test data shows how the boys have increased their aerobic endurance by improving the distance covered during the test by around 30%; instead from the results obtained through the Gacon test it emerges that the VAM team average (16.7 km / h) is in line with the study carried out by Mendez-Villanueva (VAM under 18 = 17.2 ± 0.8 km / h) (Mendez-Villanueva et al, 2012). Through the execution of the MOPER test and the Gacon test we were able to observe and monitor the evolution of the aerobic resistance of each player, being in agreement with how important the evaluation tests are during the football season.

S.","Assessment of functional baseline and return to play criteria using GPS profile","Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine","","2325-9671","10.1177/2325967119S00441","","Objectives: Return to play (RTP) are high following lower extremity injuries; however, objective sport specific clearance criteria are lacking. In ACL rehabilitation for example, current tests that are used such as single leg hop, isokinetic testing, and quad strength are not sport specific and do not take fatigue into account. With the development of wearable GPS technologies (Catapult), there is great potential for the creation of objective RTP criteria. These GPS units provide objective validated data points in regards to athletes and their movements during games, training, or rehabilitation. It is reported over 1,500 teams across 35 sports, including NFL, NBA, MLB, and NCAA, are now using this technology. Teams have a vast amount of information, however, it is largely underutilized by the medical staff, and no standardized benchmarks exist. Using this data it was our goal to establish baseline benchmarks for a variety of data metrics and to begin to establish validated return to play criteria. Methods: GPS records of a consecutive series of Division I NCAA football players were reviewed between 2015 and 2018. Ten metrics were gathered for healthy control players from eight positions (defensive back, wide receiver, running back, linebacker, tight-end, defensive line, offensive line, and quarter back. These metrics consisted of: total distance, total load, explosive yardage, explosive ratio, maximum velocity, inertial movement analysis (IMA) acceleration, IMA deceleration, change of direction (COD) left, and COD right. Average normal values were determined per session for healthy players. Overall we examined 198 player seasons data, 50 (DB), 37 (WR), 20 (RB), 47 (LB), 14 (TE) 14 (DL), 10 (OL), and 6 (QB) respectively. Results: Healthy control averages for total distance was 5456.9 yards (DB), 4973.8 yards (WR), 4260.5 yards (RB), 4054.8 yards (LB), 4334.2 yards (TE), 3498.1 yards (DL), 3274.7 yards (OL), and 4199.2 yards (QB) respectively. Average total load was 492.8 (DB), 463.8 (WR), 393.0 (RB), 367.0 (LB), 423.9 (TE), 389.7 (DL), 381.2 (OL), and 410.8 (QB) respectively. Average explosive yardage was 472.7 (DB), 605.1 (WR), 454.5 (RB), 190.1 (LB), 320.7 (TE) 107.5 (DL), 70.6 (OL), and 191.8 (QB) respectively. Average explosive ratio was 0.847 (DB), 0.855 (WR), 1.045 (RB), 0.989 (LB), 0.985 (TE) 1.53 (DL), 1.31(OL), and 1.66 (QB) respectively. Average maximum velocity was 18.3 (DB), 17.2 (WR), 17.4 (RB), 15.7 (LB), 16.1 (TE) 13.7 (DL), 12.0 (OL), and 16.6 (QB) respectively. Average acceleration was 9.27 (DB), 8.53 (WR), 9.13 (RB), 9.78 (LB), 12.01 (TE) 21.7 (DL), 16.5 (OL), and 47.1 (QB) respectively. Average deceleration was 6.11 (DB), 4.02 (WR), 4.74 (RB), 6.11 (LB), 5.68 (TE) 8.79 (DL), 9.12 (OL), and 1.25 (QB) respectively. Average COD towards left was 6.55 (DB), 7.24 (WR), 9.09 (RB), 6.98 (LB), 9.38 (TE), 13.4 (DL), 11.3 (OL), and 8.22 (QB) respectively. Average COD towards right was 5.80 (DB), 6.45 (WR), 7.84 (RB), 5.91 (LB), 6.74 (TE) 12.5 (DL), 10.7 (OL), and 6.62 (QB) respectively. Conclusion: With the established healthy averages we now have a starting point for comparison of injured athletes and their rehabilitation progress. Categories most closely correlating with return to play following specific injuries is the next step. Additionally, this information may be used in injury prevention, detecting when an athlete may be overly fatigued and at great risk for injury. More data is needed to validate these numbers as well as establish criteria for healthy return to play.","2019","2020-05-20 00:08:36","2020-05-20 00:08:36","","","","7","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2325967119S00441; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629239414","adult; conference abstract; football player; human; controlled study; season; deceleration; running; medical staff; fatigue; accident prevention; chemical oxygen demand; leg injury; normal value","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DESIGN: Reliability study. PATIENTS: Thirty noninjured high-level (Tegner Activity Score ≥9) rugby players, free from hamstring injury in the previous 2 months. ASSESSMENT: Isometric knee flexor strength (in N) in prone 0/15 degrees (hip/knee flexion) and supine 90/90 degrees position. Tests were performed by 1 female and 2 male testers whose upper-body strength was measured with a 6-repetition maximum bench press test. The prone 0/15 degrees measurement was performed with manual and external belt fixation of the dynamometer. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Absolute and relative intertester reliability were calculated using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and minimal detectable change. Paired t-tests were used to identify systematic measurement error between testers and to test for a difference in recorded knee flexor strength between methods of dynamometer fixation. METHODS: Isometric knee flexor strength was measured in prone 0/15 degrees (hip/knee flexion) and supine 90/90 degrees position. RESULTS: Good intertester reliability was found for all pairwise comparisons (ICC 0.80-0.87). MDCs (as percentage of mean strength) ranged from 15.2% to 25.4%. For tester couples where systematic error was identified, Bland-Altman plots and Pearson correlation coefficients demonstrated no statistically significant correlation between mean knee flexor strength and between-tester difference. There was no significant difference in isometric knee flexor strength between manual and belt fixation of the dynamometer. CONCLUSIONS: In strong high-level rugby players, hand-held dynamometry for isometric knee flexor strength assessment in prone 0/15 degrees and supine 90/90 degrees position is intertester reliable.","2019","2020-05-20 00:08:38","2020-05-20 00:08:38","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/JSM.0000000000000793; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L630274100","adult; female; human; male; article; rugby; hip; injury; controlled study; knee function; reliability; correlation coefficient; dynamometer; dynamometry; intermethod comparison; measurement error; minimum detectable change; systematic error","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An observational design was used to examine abdominal and lower body strength using two functional performance tests (a lower body isokinetic test and an isometric abdominal test, respectively). One hundred and thirty-two professional male soccer players from Cyprus's first and second divisions participated in this study. Testing included three and twenty-five maximal concentric flexion and extension repetitions at angle speeds of 60°/s (degrees/second) and 300°/s, respectively. On a separate occasion, participants completed two trials on an isometric device (ABTEST Gen. 3 system) for evaluation of abdominal strength. At both isokinetic speeds of 300°/s and 60°/s, abdominal strength had low to moderate significant correlations (p <.05) with quadriceps and hamstring strength. Coefficients of determination (R2) demonstrated that the variability in isokinetic variables accounted for only 14-16% of the variability of abdominal strength. Abdominal strength appears to be high in professional soccer players, but is not dependent on the sports level and/or a playing position. The results of this study demonstrate that abdominal strength and knee joint strength need to be evaluated separately.

Aim: The objective of this study was to evaluate the nutritional sufficiency status of elite young male athletes in the pre-competition period. Methods: Three-day food consumption and anthropometric measurements of the elite young athletes in the pre-competition period were recorded for 26 male voluntary athletes from a pro-professional soccer team based in Ankara Turkey. Results: The mean height of the athletes were calculated as 175.2±6.8 cm, weight 67.3±5.9 kg, body mass index (BMI) as 21.9±1.3 kg/m2 and body fat percentage 6.2±1.7. It was determined that the athletes received an average of 3225±692 kcal energy daily whereas their mean energy expenditures per day were 3322±240 kcal. The ratios of energy received from carbohydrate, protein and fats were 53.6%, 16.2%, and 30.2%, respectively. Carbohydrate and protein consumption/day/ kg body weight were 6.3±1.7 g and 1.9±0.5 g, respectively. It was determined that vitamin D consumption was inadequate for 92.3% of the athletes and calcium consumption was inadequate for 50% of the athletes. On the other hand, all of the athletes consumed vitamins B2, B6 and B12 as well as phosphorus, iron and zinc above recommended quantities. Conclusions: Nutrient consumption of young athletes at the beginning of their professional life must be monitored by a qualified dietitian and each athlete must have an individual dietary plan. Nutrition education must be arranged and the athletes’ families must be included in these trainings.","2019","2020-05-20 00:08:40","2020-05-20 00:08:40","","12-18","","1","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.23751/pn.v21i1.7127; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2001687306","adult; human; male; article; soccer player; clinical article; athlete; body mass; young adult; cholesterol; food intake; normal human; skinfold thickness; alpha tocopherol; calcium; calcium intake; caloric intake; carbohydrate; carbohydrate intake; copper; cyanocobalamin; dietary fiber; energy consumption; energy expenditure; fat; fat intake; iron intake; magnesium; monounsaturated fatty acid; nicotinic acid; nutritional status; phosphorus; polyunsaturated fatty acid; protein; protein intake; pyridoxine; retinol; riboflavin; saturated fatty acid; trace element; Turkish citizen; vitamin D; vitamin intake; vitamin K group; zinc","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: In total, 189 children with type 1 diabetes from 11 diabetes care centers, in Poland, participated in a football tournament in 3 age categories: 7-9 (21.2%), 10-13 (42.9%), and 14-17 (36%) years. Participants were qualified and organized in 23 football teams, played 4 to 6 matches of 30 minutes, and were supervised by a medical team. Data on insulin dose and glycemia were downloaded from personal pumps, glucose meters, continuous glucose monitoring, and flash glucose monitoring systems. RESULTS: The median level of blood glucose before the matches was 6.78 (4.89-9.39) mmol/L, and after the matches, it was 7.39 (5.5-9.87) mmol/L (P = .001). There were no episodes of severe hypoglycemia or ketoacidosis. The number of episodes of low glucose value (blood glucose ≤3.9 mmol/L) was higher during the tournament versus 30 days before: 1.2 (0-1.5) versus 0.7 (0.3-1.1) event/person/day, P < .001. Lactate levels increased during the matches (2.2 [1.6-4.0] mmol/L to 4.4 [2.6-8.5] mmol/L after the matches, P < .001).

The aim of this study was to assess the impact of progressive physical effort on peripheral T-cells and their molecular response. Thirteen soccer players form Pogo Szczecin S.A., a top league soccer club, (median age 21, range 18- 31, years old) performed progressive efficiency tests on a mechanical treadmill until exhaustion at the start (period 1) and the end (period 2) of a competition round. Venous blood T-lymphocyte subsets, selected hallmarks of cell death and plasma cytokine levels were determined by flow cytometry three times: pre-exercise, post-exercise, and in recovery. Although significant changes in T, Tc and Tc-naïve cell percentages were found in both periods, Th-naïve cell percentages were altered only in period 1. Post-exercise IL-10 plasma levels were higher than pre-exercise, while an increase in TNF-α levels was noticed in recovery from both periods. An increase in recovery IL-12p70 levels was observed in the second period. Increases in the percentage of T-cells with disrupted mitochondrial membrane potentials, elevated levels of phosphorylated H2AX histones and increases in early apoptotic T-cells were also observed. The immune system in soccer players creates space for naïve CD3+CD8+ cells by inducing mechanisms of cell death. It seems that the cumulative effect of physical activity during a competition round induced an adaptive mechanism, since the cell death process was induced faster during period 2.","2019","2020-05-20 00:08:42","2020-05-20 00:08:42","","437-444","","4","38","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.2478/jomb-2019-0013; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L627246458","adult; human; human experiment; article; soccer player; exercise; blood sampling; interleukin 10; interleukin 6; tumor necrosis factor; exhaustion; phenotype; cardiorespiratory fitness; CD3+ T lymphocyte; CD4+ T lymphocyte; CD8+ T lymphocyte; cell death; DNA damage; flow cytometry; helper cell; histone H2AX; histone phosphorylation; human cell; interleukin 12p70; metabolic equivalent; mitochondrial membrane potential; peripheral blood mononuclear cell; respiratory quotient; T lymphocyte subpopulation; venous blood","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Objective: The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of SAFT90 on lactate production, heart rate (HR) and rate of subjective perceived exertion (RPE) expressed by Borg scale (6-20). Methods: Fourteen male elite junior soccer players (age 15.9 ± 0.2 years, stature 180.8 ± 5.5 cm, body mass 69.8 ± 5.8 kg, body fat 8.1 ± 3.2%, VO2max 57.6 ± 4.7 ml⋅kg-1⋅min-1, maximum heart rate 192.8 ± 4.6 beats⋅min-1) participated in this study. Lactate concentration, HR and RPE were monitored during specific fatigue exercise protocol SAFT90. Results: Results of HR showed mean values of153 ± 15 beats⋅min-1, mean blood lactate concentration was 1.9 ± 0.5 mmol⋅L-1. A mean value of RPE was 11.0 ± 1.4 that corresponds to ""fairly light"" exercise. No significant change was found between consecutive SAFT90 stages for HR and lactate concentration. For Borg scale, there were significant increases between stages 20 min and 45 min and between stages 70 min and 90 min. Change between stages 45 and 70 min was not significant. Conclusions: In respect to study results, we suggest that specific fatigue protocol SAFT90 applied in U16 soccer players appears to be insufficient in terms of exercise intensity to achieve comparable lactate concentration, HR and RPE values with a soccer match.

To compare the performance in the execution of specific motor skills among novice futsal players in 3 competitive categories (U-7, U-9, and U-11) and to compare their performance in specific motor skills during the offensive and defensive phases of the game. Methods. Ten specific motor skills were investigated, including 6 offensive actions and 4 defensive actions, in 49 futsal players aged 6-11 years. Technical performance was analysed in terms of the number of actions, the effectiveness of the action (successful or unsuccessful), and where the action occurred (offensive or defensive midfield). One-way ANOVA was used with the Tukey test, when appropriate, or Student's t-test, with a significance level of 5%. Results. Players in the older categories were more effective defensively than those in the younger categories (F2,46 = 6.04, p < 0.01, partial 2 = 0.21). The two older groups had an approximately two- and three-fold greater chance, respectively, of executing successful defensive technical actions (OR = 1.82, p < 0.05; OR = 2.83, p < 0.01). Furthermore, the players were more technically effective in the offensive phase of the game than in the defensive phase (M = 41.35, SD = 21.53 and M = 16.47, SD = 7.90, respectively; t96 = 7.60, p < 0.01, d = 1.69). Conclusions. Players in older competitive categories were more effective, and players were more effective offensively than defensively.

P.","Association between community socioeconomic characteristics and access to youth flag football","Injury prevention : journal of the International Society for Child and Adolescent Injury Prevention","","1475-5785","10.1136/injuryprev-2017-042677","","BACKGROUND: The American Academy of Pediatrics has recommended that opportunities for non-tackling American football (e.g., flag football) be expanded, given concerns about the risks of brain trauma from tackle football. This study tested the hypothesis that flag football would be more accessible in communities characterised by higher socioeconomic status residents. METHODS: In July 2017, the locations of community-based organisations offering youth flag and tackle football for youth between the ages of 6 and 13 in two US states (Georgia and Washington) were aggregated (n=440). Organisations were coded in terms of the availability of tackle and/or flag football teams for youth at each year of age between 6 and 13. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to assess the odds of a community-based football organisation offering flag football, by community socioeconomic and demographic characteristics. RESULTS: In both states, communities with more educated residents were more likely to offer flag football for youth aged 6-12. For example, among 6 year-olds every 10% increase in the number of adult residents with a college education was associated with 1.51 times the odds of flag football availability (95% CI 1.22 to 1.86, P<0.001). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that youth living in communities characterised by low educational attainment are less likely than other youth to have the option of a lower contact alternative to tackle football. Relying on voluntary community-level adoption of lower contact alternatives to tackle football may result in inequitable access to such sport options. This may contribute to an inequitable burden of brain trauma from youth sport.","2019","2020-05-20 00:08:46","2020-05-20 00:08:46","","278-282","","4","25","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/injuryprev-2017-042677; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628818629","female; human; male; football; sport injury; injury; brain concussion; adolescent; child; classification; United States; access to information; attitude to health; health disparity; socioeconomics; traumatic brain injury; youth sport","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: The FV profile of 19 elite female soccer players (age 23.4 [3.8] y, height 166.4 [5.6] cm, body mass 59.7 [4.7] kg) was determined during the jumping and sprinting tasks. The F0, V0, FV slope, Pmax, and FV imbalance (difference respect to the optimal FV profile in jumping and the decrease in the ratio of horizontal force production in sprinting) were determined for each task. RESULTS: Very large correlations between both tasks were observed for Pmax (r = .75) and the performance variables (r = -.73), as well as moderate correlations for V0 (r = .49), while the F0 (r = -.14), the FV slope (r = -.09), and the FV imbalance (r = .07) were not significantly correlated between both tasks. The Pmax obtained during each specific task was the mechanical capacity most correlated with its performance variable (r = .84 in jumping and r = .99 in sprinting).

Athletes in contact sports may be at risk for pituitary insufficiencies or erectile dysfunction (ED) because of the high number of head traumas experienced during their careers. Whether multiple symptomatic concussive events are associated with later indicators of low testosterone levels and ED is unknown. Objective: To explore the associations between concussion symptom history and participant-reported indicators of low testosterone levels and ED. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study of former professional US-style football players was conducted in Boston, Massachusetts, from January 2015 to March 2017. Surveys on past football exposures, demographic factors, and current health conditions were sent via electronic and postal mail to participants within and outside of the United States. Analyses were conducted in Boston, Massachusetts; the data analysis began in March 2018 and additional analyses were performed through June 2019. Of the 13720 male former players eligible to enroll who were contacted, 3506 (25.6%) responded. Exposures: Concussion symptom score was calculated by summing the frequency with which participants reported 10 symptoms, such as loss of consciousness, disorientation, nausea, memory problems, and dizziness, at the time of football-related head injury. Main Outcomes and Measures: Self-reported recommendations or prescriptions for low testosterone or ED medication served as indicators for testosterone insufficiency and ED. Results: In 3409 former players (mean [SD] age, 52.5 [14.1] years), the prevalence of indicators of low testosterone levels and ED was 18.3% and 22.7%, respectively. The odds of reporting low testosterone levels or ED indicators were elevated for previously established risk factors (eg, diabetes, sleep apnea, and mood disorders). Models adjusted for demographic characteristics, football exposures, and current health factors showed a significant monotonically increasing association of concussion symptom score with the odds of reporting the low testosterone indicator (highest vs lowest quartile, odds ratio, 2.39; 95% CI, 1.79-3.19; P <.001). The ED indicator showed a similar association (highest quartile vs lowest, odds ratio, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.30-2.27; P <.001). Conclusions and Relevance: Concussion symptoms at the time of injury among former football players were associated with current participant-reported low testosterone levels and ED indicators. These findings suggest that men with a history of head injury may benefit from discussions with their health care clinicians regarding testosterone deficiency and sexual dysfunction.","2019","2020-05-20 00:08:52","2020-05-20 00:08:52","","1428-1438","","12","76","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamaneurol.2019.2664; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629171107","adult; football player; human; male; article; sport injury; brain concussion; unconsciousness; priority journal; major clinical study; scoring system; cohort analysis; e-mail; cross-sectional study; head injury; prevalence; prescription; risk factor; United States; middle aged; Massachusetts; disease association; demography; disorientation; dizziness; erectile dysfunction; health survey; medical history; memory disorder; nausea; postal mail; self report; testosterone; testosterone blood level","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of the study was to investigate whether serum S100B elevations were associated with frequency and magnitude of subconcussive head impacts in adolescents. This prospective cohort study of 17 high-school football players consisted of the following 12 time points: pre-season baseline, 5 in-season pre-post games, and post-season. A sensor-installed mouthguard recorded the number of head impacts, peak linear (PLA) and peak rotational (PRA) head accelerations from every practice and game. During the 5 games, players wore chest-strap heart-rate monitors to estimate players' excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC), accounting for physical exertion effects. At each time point, blood samples were obtained and assessed for S100B and creatine kinase levels to account for astrocyte damage/activation and muscle damage, respectively. Using k-means clustering on the impact data, players were categorized into high- or low-impact group. Two players withdrew during the first month of the study. A total of 156 blood samples from 15 players were assessed for S100B and creatine kinase levels and included in the analysis. A median value of 596 head impacts from 15 players were recorded during all practices and games in a season. S100B levels were significantly elevated in all post-game measures compared with the respective pre-game values (median-increase, 0.022 μg/L; interquartile-range, 0.011–0.043 μg/L, p < 0.05 for all games). Greater acute S100B increases were significantly associated with greater impact frequency, sum of PLA and PRA, with negligible contributions from physical exertion and muscle damage effects. The high-impact group exhibited greater increases in serum S100B levels at post-games than the low-impact group (high vs. low, 0.043 ± 0.035 μg/L vs. 0.019 ± 0.017 μg/L, p = 0.002). The degree of acute S100B increases was correlated with subconcussive head impact exposure, suggesting that acute astrocyte damage may be induced in an impact-dependent manner. Acute changes in serum S100B levels may become a useful tool in monitoring real-time brain damage in sports.","2019","2020-05-20 00:08:53","2020-05-20 00:08:53","","","","APR","10","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2019.00327; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628229021","female; human; human experiment; male; article; football; acceleration; heart rate; oxygen consumption; prospective study; adolescent; cohort analysis; high school; blood sampling; normal human; creatine kinase; astrocyte; cell damage; kinematics; monitor; nervous system parameters; protein blood level; protein S100B; subconcussive head impact","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Pearson's correlation coefficients were calculated to establish the associations between training load and the tested variables. There was an almost certainly moderate increase for velocity at 2mM [ES= 0.86 (0.54; 1.18)], an almost certainly very large increase for velocity at 4mM [ES= 1.32 (0.94; 1.69)], an almost certainly large increase for peak treadmill velocity [ES= 1.11 (0.63; 1.58)], and a likely moderate increase for squat jump [ES= 0.37 (0.06; 0.69)] and countermovement jump [ES=0.45 (0.19; 0.72)]. Training load had a most likely large positive correlation to velocity at 4mM [r=0.74(0.46;0.89)], a likely moderate positive correlation to velocity at 2mM [r=0.39(-0.04;0.70] and a likely moderate negative correlation to squat jump (r=-0.33(-0.66;0.11). Training load has a strong positive correlation to improvements in aerobic endurance and weak negative correlation on improvements in strength/power. Prioritizing training goals and adjusting the dose of the training load will gauge endurance adaptations with as minimal as possible negative impact on strength/power adaptations.

However, there is a gap in knowledge about the contribution of physiological variables, such as muscle damage and physical exertion, to neurological measures used to assess subconcussive impact-dependent changes. The unknown contribution of physical exertion and strenuous exercise is often listed as a limitation in field studies of subconcussive head impacts. The purpose of this investigation was to examine the relationships between subconcussive head impact frequency and magnitude and measures of physical exertion and muscle damage. Fifteen high school football players wore mouthguards with triaxial sensors in order to quantify the linear and rotational accelerations of every head impact sustained throughout one season (practices and games). Additionally, serum samples were collected at twelve time points (pre-season, pre- and post-competition for five in-season games, and post-season) and assayed for CK-MM, a skeletal muscle-specific isoenzyme of creatine kinase. Subjects wore heart rate monitors during the five games, and heart rate data were used to estimate physical exertion in terms of excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC). Mixed-effect regression modeling showed significant and positive associations between CK-MM and subconcussive head impact kinematic variables, in addition to a significant and positive association between CK-MM and EPOC. When investigating subconcussive head impacts, the effects of muscle damage should be considered when using correlated outcome measures, such as inflammatory biomarkers and vestibular assessments.","2019","2020-05-20 00:08:55","2020-05-20 00:08:55","","A37","","13","36","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2019.29100.abstracts; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628868650","adult; conference abstract; football player; human; acceleration; exercise; heart rate; oxygen consumption; controlled study; season; competition; concussion; high school; outcome assessment; creatine kinase; muscle injury; human tissue; mouth protector; biological marker; creatine kinase MM; endogenous compound; head; isoenzyme; sensor","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, it is unknown whether this is the case for American collegiate football and rugby football athletes. This study investigated the associations between serum 25(OH)D concentrations and glucose profiles in male collegiate football athletes. Thirty-four collegiate athletes (13 American football players and 21 rugby football players) aged 21 years were recruited. Their body fat percent and visceral fat area were measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and magnetic resonance imaging, respectively. The participants completed an oral glucose tolerance test (75 g glucose) with venous blood samples obtained at time points 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min for the determination of plasma glucose and serum insulin concentrations. Fasting serum 25(OH)D concentrations were also measured. The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency was 17.6% and 58.8%, respectively. The serum 25(OH)D concentrations were negatively associated with the increments in the areas under the curve (iAUC) for glucose (r = −.429, p = .011) and were borderline significantly correlated with the Matsuda index (r = −.303, p = .082). No relationships were observed between the serum 25(OH)D concentrations and other glucose profiles. Multiple stepwise regression analysis of glucose iAUC concentrations as the dependent variable indicated that the serum 25(OH)D concentrations, but not body fat indicators, were independently associated with glucose iAUC (β = −0.390, p = .025). The serum 25(OH)D concentrations were only an independent predictor for glucose iAUC in male collegiate football athletes, suggesting that increased 25(OH)D concentrations would be helpful for maintaining glucose homeostasis.","2019","2020-05-20 00:08:56","2020-05-20 00:08:56","","420-425","","4","29","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1123/ijsnem.2018-0225; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2004195338","adult; football player; human; male; article; football; rugby; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; clinical article; oxygen consumption; blood sampling; body weight; prevalence; student athlete; body fat; calcium intake; glucose; venous blood; disease association; 25 hydroxyvitamin D; blood analysis; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; fasting; fat free mass; glucose blood level; glucose homeostasis; homeostasis model assessment; insulin blood level; insulin resistance; insulin sensitivity; intra-abdominal fat; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; oral glucose tolerance test; vitamin blood level","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The BKFO showed no statistically significant (P = > 0.05) correlation to either squeeze test (rp = 0.153/0.193) or HAGOS (sport) (rp = 0.182). Conclusion: This study adds to literature surrounding monitoring of hip/groin measures in footballers. The long-lever adductor squeeze detected meaningful changes more frequently than the short-lever. Both tests shared weak, albeit statistically significant relationships with HAGOS (sport), whilst the BKFO did not. A larger prospective study is warranted to increase confidence in selecting these measures in this setting.

The sample consisted of 191 male and female athletes ranging in age from 14 to 35 years old. They played soccer, volleyball and basketball and they were cadets (43%), juniors (29.6 %) and adults (27.4%). Results showed that satisfaction of the basic psychological needs was the strongest predictor of positive self-talk or positive thoughts during competition. Specifically, perception of autonomy was the strongest predictor, because it positively predicted concentration, control of anxiety and instructions, followed by perception of competence, which positively predicted confidence. Finally, team sports coaches should promote perception of autonomy and competence in their athletes, with the aim of enhancing more positive self-talk in competition, which may promote a better performance.

Exercise induced bronchospasm (EIB) which is common among asthmatic patients, also occurs in individuals with no prior asthma diagnosis. Despite this and the fact that soccer is a high ventilation sport, there are no validated asthma management protocols in place for soccer coaches. This study aims to address 1) soccer coaches' current asthma knowledge, 2) the need for asthma related training, and 3) barriers to such training. Hypothesis: Soccer coaches will have low levels of knowledge of asthma prevention and management. They have received little or no related training and there will be barriers to providing such training. Methods: We collaborated with the Edmonton Minor Soccer Association and their members. 2300 youth soccer volunteer coaches from the Association (EMSA) were invited to participate by completing a 22 question online survey. The survey was open from June 8th to July 8th 2018. Responses were analysed by descriptive analysis followed by chi-square analysis to study comparisons between responses. Results: There was a 22% response rate (513 of 2300). Respondents were, on average, inexperienced, coached younger age groups, and approximately one third had personal experience with asthma (either they or their child had asthma). 93% of respondents had not received any asthma related training at any coaching level, whether from the EMSA or provincial association. Coaches had strong knowledge on how to respond to a player with an asthma attack, but mixed levels of knowledge on attack prevention. Experienced coaches were better at identifying players with asthma on their team and the number of asthma related experiences as coaches. Coaches demonstrated a receptive attitude towards receiving asthma training, with 91% saying training would be beneficial and 69% saying that training should be mandatory. Conclusion: The results of this first major asthma and soccer coaches study indicate that soccer coaches have limited knowledge regarding asthma management, acknowledge a need for asthma-related training, and are willing to participate in educational interventions as it pertains to their role as coaches.","2019","2020-05-20 00:08:59","2020-05-20 00:08:59","","43","","","3","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/24745332.2019.1623590; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628915027","conference abstract; female; human; male; soccer; controlled study; major clinical study; adolescent; juvenile; child; chi square test; asthma; awareness; bronchospasm; chronic disease; personal experience; prevention; volunteer","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An analysis of United States competitive athletes","Thorax","","1468-3296","10.1136/thorax-2019-BTSabstracts2019.291","","Background Asthma is prevalent in athletes and when left untreated is recognised to impact health and performance. Prior research highlights the presence of asthma-related mortality associated with sport, however, this data is now almost twenty years old and both treatment and mortality patterns have evolved over this time. Indeed the Royal College of Physicians National Review of Asthma Deaths, revealed no sport-related mortality. Thus the aim of this work was to provide an up-to-date perspective regarding asthma-related sudden death from a large athletic database. Method Retrospective analysis of the United States National Center for Catastrophic Sports Injury Research (NCCSIR) database. Information concerning sudden death was obtained via autopsy and/or news or media reports between 2012-2019. Athlete age, sex, sporting discipline/event, standard, date of death and cause of death were examined. Data are presented as absolute and percentage of total deaths. Results Two-hundred and ninety-five cases of sudden death were identified over the study period. Of these, two-hundred and two (68.5%) were attributed to a cardiac aetiology; forty-four (15%) to traumatic injury; twenty-four (8%) to heat/environmental exposure; fifteen (5%) other/unknown, and ten (3.5%) to asthma or exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) (figure 1). Asthma-related deaths occurred most frequently in elite young athletes (i.e. sponsored or scholarship recipients aged: 13-21 years) regularly participating in high-intensity intermittent-based sports: American football (60%); soccer (10%); wrestling (10%); volleyball (10%) and running (10%). The majority of asthma deaths (70%) occurred during training or competition (i.e. severe exercise-induced exacerbation) - with the remaining cases (30%) occurring at rest (i.e. several hours post-exercise or recovery rest day). Conclusion Our findings indicate that asthma is the fourth leading identified cause of sudden death in young athletes (approximately one in thirty cases). Although the relative risk of mortality is low, the importance of securing an early diagnosis and initiating appropriate therapy in athletes reporting exertional breathing difficulty should not be overlooked. Further longitudinal population-based research in this setting remains a priority.","2019","2020-05-20 00:09:00","2020-05-20 00:09:00","","A171","","","74","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L630692657; http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/thorax-2019-BTSabstracts2019.291","adult; conference abstract; female; human; male; football; soccer; sport injury; controlled study; major clinical study; competition; adolescent; running; retrospective study; volleyball; risk factor; United States; autopsy; bronchoconstriction; cause of death; disease exacerbation; dyspnea; early diagnosis; environmental exposure; exercise induced asthma; exercise recovery; heart; heat; mortality risk; sudden death; wrestling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The COPDMS intervention comprised an initial sport psychology education session (Week 1), a session introducing COPDMS (Week 2), a COPDMS session (Week 4), and a follow-up session (Week 9). During the COPDMS session, athletes mutually shared personal stories and/or information about transitions as they approached a time when they would gain a professional contract or would be released from their soccer academy. Athletes communicated a range of contextually relevant demand and resource appraisals during the COPDMS session. Several athlete and practitioner insights about the COPDMS process and outcomes were provided that can guide future researchers and practitioners seeking to develop and deliver bespoke PDMS interventions in sport.

Semistructured interviews were conducted with 10 elite coaches to determine their perceptions of the characteristics, emergence, and impact of highly influential players. The interview guide was anchored in coaching literature and leadership theory, and after the interview data in this frame were explored, these athletes were labeled cultural architects. The results of the analysis revealed 3 general dimensions of cultural architects in elite teams: (a) personal characteristics, which include elements related to their achievements on the soccer pitch, mind-set, and collective orientation; (b) relationship to the coach, which includes integrity and trust; and (c) intrateam facilitator, which includes their impact as a task-team and social-team influencer. The results represent original findings identifying the characteristics of cultural architects in soccer that are most likely transferable to many other team sports.

In sports, pejorative constructions of ID and normative views of able-bodiedness can diminish athletes and shift focus from performance to impairment. Methods: The study draws upon interviews with 17 athletes, 11 men and 6 women, aged 19 to 51, in four different disability sports clubs (floorball, athletics, bowling and football). To analyse and problematize participation in sports and its relation to a socially constructed normality, Crip theory is used as a theoretical framework, which focuses on critical views of constructions of normality and able-bodiedness. Results: The study's conclusion is that participation in sports is an integral part of athletes' lives and expressed in identity formulation and positioning in sports. Able-bodied norms in sports steer constructions of ID and ascribed meanings of ID constitute athletes' position in sports and directs them to a disability domain. Implications: Segregation of disability sports from 'regular' sports creates marginalisation and reinforces pejorative views of disability, as being something different. The results can be used to show how ablebodied norms in sports can both include and excluded athletes.","2019","2020-05-20 00:09:05","2020-05-20 00:09:05","","895","","7","63","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jir.12663; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628696402","adult; conference abstract; female; human; human experiment; male; football; clinical article; athlete; athletics; bowling; bullock; conceptual framework; identity; intellectual impairment; interview; nonhuman","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using a qualitative description methodology, semistructured interviews were conducted with 15 men who had been coached by 5 award-winning youth football coaches. The coaches were classified as pragmatic leaders. Participants' perceptions of the coaches' leadership were grouped into 3 main themes: individualized consideration, accountability/responsibility, and solving problems by valuing unique contributions. Because leadership is a process of interpersonal influence, on a practical level these themes may account for key features of the coach–athlete relationship that arise from pragmatic leadership.

The rest-activity circadian rhythms (RARs) are involved in the control of the sleep-wake cycle and altered RARs could lead to a compromised health status. Many studies focused on examining sleep behavior and circadian rhythms in physically active subjects or athletes but, unexpectedly, no data on RARs are available. Therefore, we studied the existence of the RAR in athletes and the possible difference in RAR's characteristics among sport disciplines. The study had a prospective observational design and RARs were recorded for five consecutive training days through actigraphy (Actiwatch 2 actigraph; Philips Respironics, OR, USA) in 43 athletes (mean age: 25.6 ± 3.2 years). Athletes competed in three different disciplines and had different training schedules and competition levels: professional triathletes (N = 10; 6 females and 4 males) had 2 morning (08:30-12:00) and 1 afternoon (15:00-17:00) training sessions, professional volleyball players (N = 19; 12 females and 7 males) used to train once in the morning (09:00-11:30) and once in the afternoon (15:00-18:00), and non-professional soccer players (N = 14; all males) trained always late in the evening (20:30-22:30). To determine the existence of RARs, the activity counts (A.C.) data were analyzed using the single and the population mean cosinor method; a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the Tukey-Kramer post-hoc test was used for the comparison of RAR characteristics among soccer, volleyball and triathlon athletes. Partial eta squared (ήp2) was used to determine the magnitude of the effect for significant outcomes (α = 0.05) in ANOVA. The presence of a significant RAR both for each of the 43 athletes (p < 0.001) and for the three categories of athletes (p < 0.001) was observed. RARs differed among sport disciplines: the Midline Estimating Statistic of Rhythm (MESOR) was significantly higher in triathletes (mean: 347 A.C. with 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 314-379) compared to both volleyball (mean: 188 A.C. with 95% CI: 173-203; p < 0.001) and soccer players (mean: 289 A.C. with 95% CI: 267-312; p < 0.01) with ήp2 = 0.72. Amplitude (A) values showed the same significant trend of MESOR data (ANOVA: p < 0.001; ήp2 = 0.65) while the acrophase (Φ) occurred at 18:28 for soccer players, significantly later than triathlon (15:20 h; p < 0.001) and volleyball players (16:24 h; p < 0.001) (ANOVA: p < 0.001; ήp2 = 0.84). The higher training duration and intensity reached by triathlon athletes in the morning sessions caused a phase advance of their RAR's acrophase Φ and higher MESOR and A amplitude compared to volleyball players and triathletes. Therefore, different sport disciplines require different training schedules, training loads and intensities that translate into different RARs. Strength coaches and medical staff of professional teams should strongly consider actigraphy as a practical and powerful tool to monitor RARs, sleep behavior, and the activity levels of their athletes; highlighting potential circadian disruptions through actigraphy could be helpful to prevent musculoskeletal injuries.

Given the educational role of coaches, we aim to study their attitudes and knowledge about the dangerousness of TNC. Methods: From September to May 2017, all coaches (n=509; M/F: 487/22) of the Burgundy Rugby Committee were invited to answer an electronic questionnaire anonymously, of whom 167 responded to the questionnaire. Results: Among the 167 coaches, 83 were also players and / or 15 referees, 11 (7%) were women, and half (48.5%) were over 40 years old. More than (28.2%) were tobacco smokers, mostly cigarettes (97%). They were often (33%) heavy smokers (> 10 cigarettes / day), and characterized by a small proportion (4.2%) of daily vapers. No coach declared snus consumption. Moreover, TNC was common (89.4%) before and / or after rugby sessions (match / training). Surprisingly, more than 1 coach out of 5 was unaware of the dangerousness of TNC in the context of sport (table). Conclusion : This large regional survey shows a significant level of TNC among amateur rugby coaches. These practices represent a danger not only for them, especially for dual practitioners, i.e. players and / or referees, but also for young players, given their educational role. In addition, their knowledge of the dangerousness of the CTN is only weak. This work highlights the need to carry out information / education campaigns targeted to rugby coaches and beyond to players for whom they are responsible.","2019","2020-05-20 00:09:10","2020-05-20 00:09:10","","S113","","","26","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2047487319860053; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628579417","adult; conference abstract; female; human; human experiment; male; rugby; major clinical study; questionnaire; physician; cardiovascular disease; cigarette; education; nicotine; smoking; snus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although Rugby League (RL) is a popular sport in Australia, there is limited evidence investigating RL player understanding, attitudes and perceptions towards concussion. Methods: Cross-sectional survey of RL players via an anonymous online questionnaire. The data was analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Free text responses were analysed using thematic analysis. Results: 145 RL players completed the online survey, of which, 121 responses were analysed. There was a positive relationship between the years of play and the number of concussions sustained. Amateur players had a lower understanding of concussion than professional players (p = 0.001), and concussion understanding increased with age (p = 0.000). Females had more positive attitudes and perceptions towards concussion (p = 0.049). No statistical difference was identified towards attitudes or perception when compared by level of play. Previously concussed and non-concussed players demonstrated no statistical difference in level of understanding, attitudes or perceptions. Players wanted more education on symptoms, return-to-play protocols and long-term consequences, especially amongst previously concussed (p = 0.039). Preferred modality of education included email, seminar or club workshops. Discussion: The study shows that more education is needed to improve the understanding and awareness of concussion in amateur players. This is of concern as amateur sport lacks the required medical resources to ensure accurate concussion recognition, thus placing an increased onus and responsibility on the individual players. Most RL players were able to recognise concussion signs and symptoms but struggled with the recognition of subtle symptoms. Players demonstrated an increased willingness to play through concussion symptoms in high-stakes games, increasing their exposure to unknown long-term consequences. The majority of RL players reported receiving prior education in concussion, but desired more education in symptomatology, return-to-play recovery and long-term consequences, especially in previously concussed players. The findings of the study are in line with the current concussion statement and indicates that more research and education is required to improve the understanding of sports-related concussion amongst players, members of the public and health professionals.

The grading system is currently used as the standard method to determine bone age in football players. All national and club matches are obliged to follow screening procedures strictly (e.g., anti-doping procedures). This study evaluated the performance of an automatic system based on deep learning that provides a FIFA grade upon receiving Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) images of a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study to facilitate and speed up the determination of bone age. Methods and Materials: The FIFA bone age determination system consists of six grades starting from a totally unfused epiphyseal plate (grade I) to a completely fused plate (grade VI). Variable progressive degrees of fusion are considered the basis for grades II to V. The protocol includes 9 slices in the coronal plane with a 3-mm gap between the slices. The recommended MR sequence is T1. Because the middle image in the nine-picture data set is considered the most informative slice containing the largest image of the distal radius, the study was done using this single slice as the basic source of grading, and then another volumetric set of slices 4, 5, and 6 were also used as the second group. A convolutional neural network was designed in four convolutional layers including pooling, rectified linear unit (ReLU), and fully connected layers. Fifty-five teenage football players of the national U17 team were examined using a 1.5-T Siemens Avanto machine. The studies were interpreted by a musculoskeletal radiologist member of the AFC panel of radiologists aware of the FIFA scoring and grading system. Thirty-six cases were used for training and 19 cases for testing of the CNN. To increase the number of training images, augmentation was performed by rotation and moving the original images. Overall, 613 images were obtained for training and 267 for testing. Results: Images were introduced to the neural network resulting in sequential layers of meaningful output. The final outcome of the network as the FIFA grade of the case was compared with the interpretation of the radiologist (Table 1). The findings indicate a high accuracy of the single-slice data set; the accuracy approached 100% when the volumetric three-slice sets were used. Conclusion: The findings of this research indicate a convolutional neural network can be used for automated bone age determination and FIFA grading of wrist MRI with reasonably high accuracy.","2019","2020-05-20 00:09:12","2020-05-20 00:09:12","","","","","23","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629059670; http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/s-0039-1692580","conference abstract; football player; human; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; clinical article; controlled study; adolescent; adolescence; rotation; bone age determination; deep learning; digital imaging and communications in medicine; distal radius; epiphysis plate; machine; musculoskeletal radiologist; wrist","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Kicking is a soccer fundamental, which depends on many different and complex factors (technique, foot-ball interaction, ball flight, etc.). Therefore, it is important to identify players that are able to perform faster kicks using both dominant and non-dominant leg. The current study investigated some basic variables of different soccer kicking speed and their relevance to success in youth soccer academy. 119 players from the first and the second division participated to this study. They were randomly divided into age groups (U-15, U-17, and U19) and team status (first team, reserves). The diagnostic ability of the different ball kicking speed tests in capturing differences between first team players and reserves among different age categories were computed using the receiver operating characteristics analysis. Results demonstrated that first team players achieved better results when comparing to reserves in each category. In addition, differences were greater in the U-15 and the U-17 than in the U-19 age group. In conclusion, ball kicking speed could be one of the possible identification tools to evaluate players' success in youth soccer.","2019","2020-05-20 00:09:14","2020-05-20 00:09:14","","","","5","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0217101; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002008032","human; article; soccer; controlled study; velocity; juvenile; randomized controlled trial; receiver operating characteristic","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Sweat rate and sweat Na+ concentration show high interindividual variability, even in individuals exercising under similar conditions. Testosterone and cortisol may regulate sweat Na+ loss by modifying the expression/activity of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator. This has not been tested. As a first approximation, the authors aimed to determine whether basal serum concentrations of testosterone or cortisol, or the testosterone/cortisol ratio relate to sweat Na+ loss during exercise. A total of 22 male elite soccer players participated in the study. Testosterone and cortisol were measured in blood samples before exercise (basal). Sweat samples were collected during a training session, and sweat Na+ concentration was determined. The basal serum concentrations of testosterone and cortisol and their ratio were (mean [SD]) 13.6 (3.3) pg/ml, 228.9 (41.4) ng/ml, and 0.06 (0.02), respectively. During exercise, the rate of Na+ loss was related to cortisol (r = .43; p < .05) and to the testosterone/cortisol ratio (r = -.46; p < .01), independently of the sweating rate. The results suggest that cortisol and the testosterone/cortisol ratio may influence Na+ loss during exercise. It is unknown whether this regulation depends on the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator.","2019","2020-05-20 00:09:15","2020-05-20 00:09:15","","658-663","","6","29","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1123/ijsnem.2019-0129; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2004195369","adult; human; human experiment; male; article; elite athlete; soccer player; exercise; blood sampling; testosterone; testosterone blood level; body temperature; cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator; electrolyte; hydrocortisone; hydrocortisone blood level; protein expression; sodium ion; sweat; sweating; thermoregulation; water loss","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: The data was collected from 5 subjects, and their PPG, ECG, and GSR had been monitored during watching a 19-minute edited video clip, including three different sports (soccer, basketball, and volleyball) and resting time between the games. They were asked to complete a brand familiarity survey before watching the clip, to understand how it effect the advertising awareness and recall afterward. The clip was played two times, the first watching is for testing advertising awareness, while the second one is for recall, by focusing on watching the LED broad. Results: According to the bio-signal and results of the survey, three main results have been observed: 1) The subjects become more nervous when focusing on the advertising than the games; 2) the subjects are more nervous when watching basketball and volleyball compare with soccer; and 3) the subjects are more nervous when they see a brand they are unfamiliar with than familiar with. Conclusions: To interpreting the results, the subjects' nervous reaction could be seen as paying more attention to recognize or remember, which shows the less effectiveness of advertising exposure. Concerning brand recognizing and memory, sponsoring soccer events could be more efficient than sponsoring basketball and volleyball. Also, brand familiarity also influence the brand recognizing and memory that marketers should concern about the attributes of the audience before making sponsoring decision.","2019","2020-05-20 00:09:18","2020-05-20 00:09:18","","40","","","125","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L631581661","adult; conference abstract; female; human; human experiment; male; soccer; basketball; clinical article; controlled study; memory; electrocardiogram; volleyball; videorecording; awareness; advertising; sporting event","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods The y-balance test (measure of dynamic postural control), isokinetic (concentric and eccentric) knee flexion and extension strength, isometric hip abduction and adduction strength, lower extremity joint range of motion (ROM) and core stability were assessed in 44 elite male futsal players. A feature selection process was carried out before building a BN (using the Tabu search algorithm) for each leg. The BN models built were used to make belief updating processes to study the individual and concurrent contributions of the selected parameters of neuromuscular performance on dynamic postural control. Results The BNs generated using the selected features by the algorithms correlation attribute evaluator and chi squared reported the highest evaluation criteria (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC]) for the dominant (AUC = 0.899) and non-dominant (AUC = 0.879) legs, respectively. Conclusions The BNs demonstrated that performance achieved in the y-balance test appears to be widely influenced by hip and knee flexion and ankle dorsiflexion ROM measures in the sagittal plane, as well as by measures of static but mainly dynamic core stability in the frontal plane. Therefore, training interventions aimed at improving or maintaining dynamic postural control in elite male futsal players should include, among other things, exercises that produce ROM scores equal or higher than 127 of hip flexion, 132.5 of knee flexion as well as 34 and 30.5 of ankle dorsiflexion with the knee flexed and extended, respectively. Likewise, these training interventions should also include exercises to maintain or improve both the static and dynamic (medial-lateral plane) core stability so that futsal players can achieve medial radial error values lower than 6.69 and 8.79 mm, respectively.","2019","2020-05-20 00:09:19","2020-05-20 00:09:19","","","","7","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0220065; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002411799","adult; human; male; article; hip; exercise; controlled study; receiver operating characteristic; abduction; adduction; ankle; knee function; range of motion; area under the curve; classifier","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Parents provided background information and completed mood/behavioral questionnaires, and each athlete completed a neuropsychological battery. RESULTS: Eight athletes (26%) had a history of concussion before assessment. Concussion risk was related to lack of medical evaluation in prior concussions, tackling exposure (in both offensive and defensive positions), and multisport participation. There were no cognitive or psychological differences based on concussion history. DISCUSSION: Findings identify factors that may contribute to concussion risk in children and show the need for further research in this understudied population.","2019","2020-05-20 00:09:19","2020-05-20 00:09:19","","14-25","","1","33","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pedhc.2018.05.009; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L625537572","human; male; article; football; incidence; athlete; cohort analysis; concussion; questionnaire; juvenile; child; mood; complication; traumatic brain injury; medical assessment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: Fifty-one middle-aged (61.1 ± 6.4 years) T2D patients were randomly allocated to the soccer+diet group (SDG) or the diet group (DG). The control group comprised T2D patients observing a caloric-restricted diet who did not receive soccer training. Over 12 weeks, SDG performed 3 × 40 min per week of soccer training. Results: The first soccer session for SDG induced acute increases in blood lactate (1.4 ± 0.1–6.0 ± 0.7 mmol/l, P < 0.05) and glucagon levels (112.1 ± 6.2–142.9 ± 8.0 pg/ml, P < 0.05), whereas glucose and insulin levels remained unchanged. Moreover, this session showed suppressed insulin levels as well as higher free fatty acids, lactate levels and glucagon/insulin ratio compared to DG (p < 0.05). After 12 weeks, a baseline decrease was observed in glucagon, leptin and lactate levels in SDG and DG (p < 0.05), whereas HOMA-IR, Adipo-IR and glucose levels were lower only in SDG (p < 0.05). At the last soccer training session, the blood lactate response was significantly lower than for the first session (4.0 ± 0.4 vs 6.0 ± 0.7 mmol/l). At 48 h pre intervention, a decrease was observed in leptin levels (p < 0.05), which remained lower post intervention. The positive correlation between leptin and insulin, and the lower levels after training, could be attributed to the improved insulin sensitivity along with the weight loss observed in both groups (~3.4 kg for DG and 3.7 kg for SDG). Conclusion: Acute soccer sessions markedly improved insulin action markers in T2D patients, while the cumulative effects enhanced insulin sensitivity and decreased risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease after 12 weeks of intervention better than caloric-restricted diet.","2019","2020-05-20 00:09:25","2020-05-20 00:09:25","","","","","209","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2019.112618; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002369876","adult; female; human; male; article; soccer; exercise; priority journal; controlled study; major clinical study; blood sampling; randomized controlled trial; risk factor; middle aged; glucose; insulin; lactic acid; biological marker; fasting; glucose blood level; homeostasis model assessment; insulin blood level; insulin sensitivity; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; aged; antihypertensive agent; body weight loss; caloric restriction; correlational study; diabetic patient; diet therapy; fatty acid; fatty acid blood level; glucagon; glucagon blood level; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; hypotension; lactate blood level; leptin; metformin; sulfonylurea; treatment duration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Football has a high concussion incidence relative to other youth sports. This is particularly concerning given recent evidence suggesting sport-related concussions are associated with late-life cognitive and psychological dysfunction in former athletes. Unfortunately, there are currently few proven interventions to prevent concussion in football. The purpose of this study was to evaluate a mentored intervention program designed to teach safe play techniques and thereby reduce head impact frequency and severity in high school football players. Methods: In a clustered quasi-experimental study design, the player education intervention program was provided to two out of three teams in year one, two out of four teams in year two, and all four teams in year three. Head impacts were measured using in-helmet accelerometers worn by all players. Head impact data and game video were used to identify “high risk” players on intervention teams to receive individualized mentoring. Players were identified as candidates for intervention based on three criteria: 1) greater than 20% of head impacts sustained to the top of the head, 2) greater than 7% of impacts exceeded 60g in peak linear acceleration, and 3) player sustained a concussion. High-risk players attended 3 individual or small-group education sessions over 3 weeks with a mentor who analyzed game film to teach safer playing techniques. Intervention effects were evaluated by comparing post-intervention to pre-intervention head impact data. Coach and player satisfaction were assessed to evaluate the program's acceptability and impact. Results: 220 athletes (143 intervention; 77 control) participated. Of these, 32 (14%) were classified “high risk” with playing techniques amenable to intervention. Overall, 21 (66%) of mentored athletes demonstrated a reduction in top-of-head impacts (considered a high-risk impact zone) and 17 (53%) of mentored athletes demonstrated a reduction in high magnitude (>60g) hits. On average, the proportion of top-of-head impacts dropped 2.75% in mentored players, and 2.04% in non-mentored players. The proportion of head impacts classified as high-magnitude (>60g) dropped 1.07% from pre- to post-intervention in mentored players. There was minimal (<1%) change in high magnitude impacts in non-mentored players. In post-season exit surveys, most mentored players “agreed” (n=18, 69%) that his playing behaviors improved because of the study. Most intervention team coaches thought the study was “effective” (n=31, 97%). Conclusions/Significance: Mentoring effects were modest; however, athletes and coaches viewed the program as effective. Behavioral interventions have potential to reduce head impact frequency and severity in football but may require more intensive mentoring than the 3-session model tested in this study.

J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2019-The aim of this study was to explore the ""performance-injury risk"" conflict during cutting, by examining whole-body joint kinematics and kinetics that are responsible for faster change-of-direction (COD) performance of a cutting task in soccer players, and to determine whether these factors relate to peak external multiplanar knee moments. 34 male soccer players (age: 20 ± 3.2 years; body mass: 73.5 ± 9.2 kg; height: 1.77 ± 0.06 m) were recruited to investigate the relationships between COD kinetics and kinematics with performance and multiplanar knee joint moments during cutting. Three-dimensional motion data using 10 Qualisys Oqus 7 infrared cameras (240 Hz) and ground reaction force data from 2 AMTI force platforms (1,200 Hz) were collected to analyze the penultimate foot contact and final foot contact (FFC). Pearson's or Spearman's correlations coefficients revealed performance time (PT), peak external knee abduction moment (KAM), and peak external knee rotation moment (KRM) were all significantly related (p < 0.05) to horizontal approach velocity (PT: ρ = -0.579; peak KAM: ρ = 0.414; peak KRM: R = -0.568) and FFC peak hip flexor moment (PT: ρ = 0.418; peak KAM: ρ = -0.624; peak KRM: ρ = 0.517). Performance time was also significantly (p < 0.01) associated with horizontal exit velocity (ρ = -0.451) and, notably, multiplanar knee joint loading (peak KAM: ρ = -0.590; peak KRM: ρ = 0.525; peak KFM: ρ = -0.509). Cohen's d effect sizes (d) revealed that faster performers demonstrated significantly greater (p < 0.05; d = 1.1-1.7) multiplanar knee joint loading, as well as significantly greater (p < 0.05; d = 0.9-1.2) FFC peak hip flexor moments, PFC average horizontal GRFs, and peak knee adduction angles. To conclude, mechanics associated with faster cutting performance seem to be ""at odds"" with lower multiplanar knee joint loads. This highlights the potential performance-injury conflict present during cutting.","2019","2020-05-20 00:09:29","2020-05-20 00:09:29","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1519/JSC.0000000000003252; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628619684","adult; human; male; article; soccer player; hip; injury; knee; controlled study; young adult; height; effect size; abduction; adduction; rotation; kinematics; foot; ground reaction force; infrared camera","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Multiple biomechanical parameters from countermovement (CMJ) squat (SJ) and drop (DJ) jump testing of elite female soccer players (n = 60) within the same national training centre were analysed across ages 9-11y, 12-14y and 15-19y. Effects of age group and jump type on jump height were found, with the older jumping higher than the younger groups in all jumps (P < 0.05). For DJ, higher reactive strength index was found for older, compared to each younger group (P < 0.001). For CMJ and SJ, peak power was the most decisive characteristic, with significant differences between each group for absolute peak power (P < 0.0001) and body-weight-normalised peak power in CMJ (57 ± 7W/kg, 50 ± 7W/kg, 44.7 ± 5.5W/kg; P < 0.05) and between the older and each younger group in SJ (56.7 ± 7.1W/kg, 48.9 ± 7.1W/kg, 44.6 ± 6W/kg; P < 0.01). Age-related differences in jumping performance in youth elite female soccer players appear to be due to power production during standing jumps and by the ability to jump with shorter ground contact times during reactive jumps.","2019","2020-05-20 00:09:30","2020-05-20 00:09:30","","1-7","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02640414.2019.1674526; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629490477","female; human; article; football; soccer player; controlled study; major clinical study; adolescent; juvenile; body weight; child; school child; athletic performance; jumping; plyometrics; contact time","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Twelve male futsal players were randomly assigned into two groups (n = 6 for each group) during 10 training sessions either with or without leg BFR. Prior to and post-training sessions, participants completed a series of tests to assess anabolic hormones and leg strength. Pneumatic cuffs were initially inflated to 110% of leg systolic blood pressure and further increased by 10% after every two completed sessions. In comparison with baseline, the resting post-training levels of myostatin (p = 0.002) and IGF-1/MSTN ratio (p = 0.006) in the BFR group changed, whereas no change in the acute level of IGF-1 and myostatin after exercise was observed. Peak torque of knee extension and flexion increased in both groups (p < 0.05). A trend of increased neural activation of all heads of the quadriceps was observed in both groups, however, it was statistically significant only for rectus femoris in BFR (p = 0.02). These findings indicated that the addition of BFR to normal futsal training might induce greater neuromuscular benefits by increasing muscle activation and augmenting the hormonal response.","2019","2020-05-20 00:09:34","2020-05-20 00:09:34","","","","MAY","10","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2019.00614; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628303660","adult; human; human experiment; male; article; cardiovascular parameters; heart rate; controlled study; sport; athlete; young adult; muscle contraction; rectus femoris muscle; muscle strength; normal human; knee function; futsal; systolic blood pressure; torque; blood flow restriction; electromyography; hormone response; isokinetic exercise; leg blood flow; myostatin; pneumatic cuff; quadriceps femoris muscle; somatomedin C","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This quasi-experimental study aimed to compare blood volume (BV) responses with heat and altitude training camps in Australian footballers. METHODS: The BV of 7 professional Australian footballers (91.8 [10.5] kg, 191.8 [10.1] cm) was measured throughout 3 consecutive spring/summer preseasons. During each preseason, players participated in altitude (year 1 and year 2) and heat (year 3) environmental training camps. Year 1 and year 2 altitude camps were in November/December in the United States, whereas the year 3 heat camp was in February/March in Australia after a full exposure to summer heat. BV, red cell volume, and plasma volume (PV) were measured at least 3 times during each preseason. RESULTS: Red cell volume increased substantially following altitude in both year 1 (d = 0.67) and year 2 (d = 1.03), before returning to baseline 4 weeks postaltitude. Immediately following altitude, concurrent decreases in PV were observed during year 1 (d = -0.40) and year 2 (d = -0.98). With spring/summer training in year 3, BV and PV were substantially higher in January than temporally matched postaltitude measurements during year 1 (BV: d = -0.93, PV: d = -1.07) and year 2 (BV: d = -1.99, PV: d = -2.25), with year 3 total BV, red cell volume, and PV not changing further despite the 6-day heat intervention. CONCLUSIONS: We found greater BV after training throughout spring/summer conditions, compared with interrupting spring/summer exposure to train at altitude in the cold, with no additional benefits observed from a heat camp following spring/summer training.","2019","2020-05-20 00:09:35","2020-05-20 00:09:35","","1-5","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1123/ijspp.2019-0350; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629621893","football player; human; article; case report; clinical article; team sport; summer; quasi experimental study; United States; heat; altitude; Australia; cold stress; erythrocyte volume; hypoxia; plasma volume; spring","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Data were used from the Consortium of College Athlete Research (C-CAR) group. Four hundred sixty-seven players were included in this study. Height, body mass, total and regional fat mass, lean mass, and bone mineral density were measured in each athlete in the preseason (June-August). Players were categorized by their offensive or defensive position for comparisons. Linemen tended to have the higher fat and lean mass measures (p ≤ 0.05 for all) compared with other positions. Positions that mirror each other (e.g. linemen) had similar body composition and body ratios. All positions were classified as overweight or obese based on body mass index (BMI) (>25 kg·m), yet other than offensive and defensive linemen, all positions had healthy percent body fat (13-20%) and low visceral fat mass (<500 g). The data presented here provide normative positional data for total and regional fat mass, lean mass, and bone density in Division 1 collegiate football players. Player position had a significant effect on body composition measures and is likely associated with on-field positional requirements. From a player's health perspective, although all positions had relatively high BMI values, most positions had relatively low body fat and visceral fat, which is important for the health of players during and after their playing career. The increased accuracy and reliability of DXA provides greater information, regarding positional differences in college football players compared with other methods.","2019","2020-05-20 00:09:36","2020-05-20 00:09:36","","1339-1346","","5","33","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1519/JSC.0000000000001888; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L627807067","human; male; football; adolescent; athlete; body mass; young adult; physiology; body composition; bone density; morphometry; obesity; photon absorptiometry; reproducibility; university","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Objective: The aim of this paper is to present nutritional status and its correlation with the somatic determinants of training athletes and physical education students. Material and methods: This study involved 12 weightlifting players (subgroup-WL), 15 soccer players (subgroup-SP), 12 table tennis players (subgroup-TT) and 12 female students of physical education (subgroup-C). In all subjects, the age and somatic variables were recorded and the daily intake of energy, water, proteins, fats and carbohydrates was determined by 24-h dietary recalls. Results: Although the analysis of variance did not show significant differences in somatic variables and nutrition data, post hoc analysis showed significant differences between some subgroups in terms of age, BMI, fat content (BF), fat-free mass (FFM) and the amount of water, protein and carbohydrates consumed during the day. It was also shown that somatic variables correlated with relatively expressed amounts of energy, proteins and carbohydrates consumed in individual subgroups, as well as in the whole group formed from all subgroups of studied women. In addition, there were significant correlations between somatic variables and the total amount of water consumed in the whole group and the total amount of protein consumed in subgroup C (p<0.05), as well as the total amount of fat consumed in subgroup WL. Conclusions: In summary, it was found that the examined women used an abnormal hypoenergetic diet with too low carbohydrate content in which were more useful relative than absolute amounts of consumed proteins, fats and carbohydrates. In this unfavorable situation, dietary education of the respondents seems to be necessary.","2019","2020-05-20 00:09:37","2020-05-20 00:09:37","","243-251","","3","70","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629314480","adult; female; human; sport; athlete; body mass; young adult; physiology; nutritional status; Poland; body composition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Cross-sectional study. Air displacement plethysmography was used to estimate body volume and, in turn, density. Body composition, bone mineral content and bone mineral density were assessed for the whole body and at standardized regions using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Static grip strength was assessed with an adjustable dynamometer, and peak torque derived from isokinetic strength dynamometer (concentric muscular knee actions at 60°/s).

Methods: The subjects consisted of 32 players (20 players from Yogyakarta State University and 12 players from Gadjah Mada University) who contributed to this study. Body type, known as somatotype, was determined by using anthropometric measurement (height, weight, subcutaneous fat thickness, arm and calf circumference, epicondylar humerus, and femur width). Food intake was measured by the 24 h food recall. The cardiorespiratory function, described by VO2max, was measured by the yo-yo intermittent recovery test level 2. The study was conducted in April - June 2014. Data were analyzed descriptively using statistical software. Results: More than 80% of the subjects had normal nutritional status (Body Mass Index = 21.54 ± 1.84). The average body type of players was balanced mesomorph (2.6-4.4-2.7).

Low-impact sports, like swimming, may a have a negative or no effect. The aim of the present study is to evaluate bone mineral density (BMD, g/cm2) and bone mineral content (BMC, kg) among female high performance athletes from aquatic and non-aquatic sports and to assess possible differences with sedentary controls. Methods: Participants are elite female athletes over 18 years, from the Spanish Olympic teams, with at least 12–15 h of weekly training on aquatic sports: swimming (n = 19), synchronized swimming (n = 24) and water polo (n = 14), and elite female athletes from non-aquatic sports: professional football players of Futbol Club Barcelona team (n = 92), Spanish national volleyball (n = 26) and field hockey teams (n = 29) as well as sedentary controls (n = 126). Bone mineral density scans was performed using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry for whole body, segmental analysis, proximal femur and lumbar spine. Results: Non-aquatic female athletes have total and segments BMC and BMD values higher than those of aquatic athletes, that in turn show similar BMD values compared to controls. BMD in lumbar spine and proximal femur was higher in non-aquatic sports compared to aquatic sports athletes and both were higher than controls. Conclusion: BMD is not negatively compromised by the practice of aquatic sports at a highly competitive level. However, non-aquatic female athletes show a higher BMD. Time training out of the water improves BMD. Our findings suggest that swimming and synchronized swimming should be combined with weight-bearing, impact or strength activities, as they do not seem to be osteogenic sports.","2019","2020-05-20 00:09:43","2020-05-20 00:09:43","","393-400","","","127","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bone.2019.06.030; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002427774","adult; female; human; human experiment; article; football; controlled study; athlete; hockey; swimming; volleyball; bone density; femur; bone mineral; lumbar spine; water polo; water sport","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Sixty-seven male football players with ID were studied: 22 with Down syndrome (DS) and 45 without DS. The average age was 26 years (range: 16 ̶ 50 years). A group of 25 age-matched sedentary individuals with ID (11 DS and 14 non-DS) and another group of 20 healthy participants of the same age group not involved in competitive football were comparatively analysed. There were no differences in the bone quality parameters when the healthy sedentary individuals were compared with both the sedentary and the football players with ID. However, the speed of sound (SOS), T-score, and estimated bone mineral density (BMD) were of higher values in the football players with ID than in the sedentary ID group (p < 0.05). On comparing the football players with non-DS ID with the sedentary non-DS individuals, significant differences were noted in SOS (p < 0.01), T-scores (p < 0.01), and estimated BMD (p < 0.01). Four of the 45 non-DS (8.9%) and none of the football players with DS had T-scores less than −1.5. Two of the 14 sedentary non-DS participants (14.3%) had T-scores indicating osteoporosis. In summary, the ID population actively involved in football showed higher values of bone mass parameters than their sedentary ID and healthy peers. The participants with non-DS ID showed a higher prevalence of osteoporosis than the football players with DS. Participation in sports seems to prevent bone loss in individuals with ID.

After presenting brief video clips of a soccer scene, participants had to imagine themselves as the acting player and think either of a creative or obvious move that might lead to a goal. Findings revealed stronger activation during trials in which the generation of obvious moves was required, relative to trials requiring creative moves. The reversed contrast (creative > obvious) showed no significant effects. Activations were mainly left-lateralized, primarily involving the cuneus, middle temporal gyrus, and the rolandic operculum, which are known to support the processing of multimodal input from different sensory, motor and perceptual sources. Interestingly, more creative solutions in the soccer task were associated with smaller contrast values for the activation difference between obvious and creative trials, or even with more activation in the latter. Furthermore, higher trait creative potential (as assessed by a figural creativity test) was associated with stronger activation differences between both conditions. These findings suggest that with increasing soccer-specific creative task performance, the processing of the manifold information provided by the soccer scenario becomes increasingly important, while in individuals with higher trait creative potential these processes were recruited to a minor degree. This study showed that soccer-specific creativity tasks modulate activation levels in a network of regions supporting various cognitive functions such as semantic information processing, visual and motor imagery, and the processing and integration of sensorimotor and somatosensory information.","2019","2020-05-20 00:09:45","2020-05-20 00:09:45","","755-764","","3","40","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hbm.24408; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L624061409","adult; female; human; human experiment; male; article; soccer; decision making; brain function; creativity; cuneus; imagery; middle temporal gyrus; parietal operculum; task performance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To study the burnout–recovery process, eight elite soccer coaches were followed for 10 years. All eight were active elite coaches at the inception of this study and reported elevated emotional exhaustion scores on Maslach's Burnout Inventory Educators Survey (MBI-ES). The coaches completed MBI-ES three additional times (year 3, 7, and 10), and they were also interviewed on the same occasions. At the 3-year follow-up, seven of the eight coaches reduced their exhaustion scores. The coach presenting with unchanged scores both at the 3 - and 7-year follow-up was the only one still coaching at the elite level. All coaches revealed during the interviews that they struggled to manage their work–life balance well; some worked too many hours, some experienced difficulty in managing conflicting role-demands, and some wrestled with external pressures. Their approach to recovery was, however, similar. Apart from moving away from coaching at the elite level, they unanimously mentioned that they changed their approach to coaching to make recovery possible. They achieved the latter by, for example, increasing control and delegating responsibility. According to our longitudinal results, burnout frequently regarded as an end-state can decrease over time, provided that decisive action is taken to change situational factors and personal demands. This frequently meant withdrawing from coaching, which in turn explains why coach retention remains a serious challenge for most organizations with teams/athletes competing at the elite level.

The aim of this study was threefold: (1) to investigate if cam morphology development is associated with growth plate status; (2) to examine whether cam morphology continues to develop after growth plate closure; and (3) to qualitatively describe cam morphology development over 5-year follow-up. METHODS: Academy male football players (n=49) participated in this prospective 5-year follow-up study (baseline 12-19 years old). Anteroposterior and frog-leg lateral views were obtained at baseline (142 hips), 2.5-year (126 hips) and 5-year follow-up (98 hips). Cam morphology on these time points was defined as: (A) visual scores of the anterior head-neck junction, classified as: (1) normal, (2) flattening, and (3) prominence; and (B) alpha angle ≥60°. Proximal femoral growth plates were classified as open or closed. Cam morphology development was defined as every increase in visual score and/or increase in alpha angle from <60° to ≥60°, between two time points. This resulted in 224 measurements for cam morphology development analysis. RESULTS: Cam morphology development was significantly associated with open growth plates based on visual score (OR: 10.03, 95% CI 3.49 to 28.84, p<0.001) and alpha angle (OR: 2.85, 95% CI 1.18 to 6.88, p=0.020). With both definitions combined, cam developed in 104 of 142 hips during follow-up. Of these 104 hips, cam developed in 86 hips (82.7%) with open growth plate and in 18 hips (17.3%) with a closed growth plate. Cam morphology developed from 12 to 13 years of age until growth plate closure around 18 years. CONCLUSION: Cam morphology of the hip is more likely to develop with an open growth plate.","2019","2020-05-20 00:09:48","2020-05-20 00:09:48","","532-538","","9","53","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bjsports-2018-099328; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L627365237","human; male; soccer; diagnostic imaging; hip; prospective study; adolescent; athlete; follow up; child; epiphysis plate; femur; anatomy and histology; bone development","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Injuries commonly occur during the tackle and these account for significant time lost from training and play. Simulated tackling tasks have previously shown a reduction in shoulder joint position sense and it is possible that this may contribute to injury. There is growing evidence in support of injury prevention programmes, but none so far are dedicated specifically to tackling. We postulate that a brief neuromuscular warm up could alter the negative affects of fatigue on shoulder Joint Position sense. METHODS: In this field based, repeated measures design study, 25 semi-professional Rugby players participated. JPS was measured at Criterion angles of 45° and 80° of right arm shoulder external rotation. Reproduction accuracy prior to and following a neuromuscular warm up and simulated tackling task was then assessed. RESULTS: In pre-warm up JPS measures, the spread of angle errors were larger at the 80° positions. Adding the warm up, the spread of the angle errors at the 80° positions decreased compared to pre-intervention measures. TOST analysis comparing pre- and post-testing angle errors, with the addition of the warm up, indicated no difference in JPS. CONCLUSIONS: The neuromuscular warm up resulted in a decrease in JPS error variance meaning fewer individuals made extreme errors. The TOST analysis results also suggest the neuromuscular warm up used in this study could mitigate the negative effects of tackling on JPS that has been seen in prior research. This neuromuscular warm up could play a role in preventing shoulder injuries. It can easily be added to existing successful injury prevention programmes.","2019","2020-05-20 00:09:52","2020-05-20 00:09:52","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L627708122; http://dx.doi.org/10.23736/S0022-4707.19.09568-9","adult; human; article; rugby; warm up; fatigue; rotation; accident prevention; simulation; prevention; error; pretest posttest design; reproduction; shoulder injury","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The biomechanical factors of this phenomenon have been extensively studied in a laboratory-based setting, but there has been little progress in reducing the incidence of ACL injury in young female athletes. It is plausible, therefore, to suggest that the biomechanical improvements noted in a laboratory-based setting do not directly translate to a field-based setting. Preventive neuromuscular training programs are typically field-based and have been shown to be an effective intervention for reducing ACL injury risk by improving dynamic, frontal-plane knee stability. However, these programs are time consuming and prone to compliance and implementation issues. For these reasons, researchers have attempted to identify the minimum viable training program or wearable device that can be studied in the field using video cameras to determine their influence on movement-related risk factors for ACL injury. Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a wearable neuromuscular device (WND) with or without the addition of a field-based, preventive neuromuscular training program on jump-landing risk assessment in young female soccer athletes. Methods: Thirty-nine female soccer players (161.0 +/- 6.6 cm; 49.4 kg +/- 5.9; 13.3 +/- 0.5 y) from two different teams in a local soccer club volunteered to participate in this study. Team 1 (n = 25) performed a 6-week, field-based NMT program while wearing a WND. The NMT was instructed by a trained exercise specialist. The NMT program was divided into three, two-week blocks of progressively increasing levels of exercise complexity and intensity focused on improving the strength and activation behavior of the trunk, hip and thigh muscles. Field-based movement testing was performed in the first week before training began (pre-test) and in the seventh week upon completion of the NMT program (post-test). During testing video cameras recorded a jump-landing task in the frontal and sagittal planes. The Landing Error Scoring System (LESS) and a novel version of the LESS (LESS-RMC) was used to asses movement quality related to ACL injury risk. Team 2 (n=14) wore the WND for an equal amount of athletic exposures over 7 weeks but did not perform the NMT program. Four different raters were recruited to visually score all jump landing trials using the two different rating protocols during the pre-test and post-test. For each visual assessment (LESS & LESS-RMC) a repeated measures ANOVA was conducted to explore within group (test) and between group (team) differences. Results: Repeated measure ANOVA results for the LESS score scale indicated a significant within factor difference in pretest and post test scores F(7.398, 27.533) = 8.598, P < 0.05. Pretest scores for team 1 (6.18 +/- 1.68) and team 2 (6.95 +/- 0.94) both saw a significant reduction in ACL risk scores to 5.44 +/- 1.70 and 6.31 +/- 1.75, respectively. ANOVA results for the LESS-RMC scale also indicated a significant within factor difference in pretest and posttests F(6.756, 35.624) = 6.069, p < 0.05. Pretest scores for Team 1 (6.02 +/- 1.99) and Team 2 (6.49 +/- 1.33) both saw a significant reduction in ACL risk scores to 5.10 +/- 1.77 and 6.09 +/- 1.50, respectively. ANOVA results revealed no significant differences between team scores for the LESS (F(0.031,27.533) = 0.036, p > 0.05) or LESS-RMC (F(1.053,35.624) =.946, p > 0.05) scales. Conclusion: The results reveal that the NMT program utilized in this study had no statistically significant additive effect on the visual risk assessment scores for Team 1 compared to Team 2, who had no NMT intervention and only wore the WND. Collectively, these results suggest that simply wearing a WND during 6 weeks of practice may be a less evasive and cheaper alternative to a NMT program.","2019","2020-05-20 00:09:54","2020-05-20 00:09:54","","N.PAG-N.PAG","","","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","","","","https://gateway.library.qut.edu.au/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=c8h&AN=136537161&site=ehost-live&scope=site","Soccer; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries -- Risk Factors; Wearable Sensors; Congresses and Conferences -- Georgia; Georgia; Athletes, Female; Clinical Trials; Neuromuscular Facilitation; Risk Assessment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, evidence suggests that these perceptions may be biased by variations in athlete maturity. The primary aim of this study was to examine the predictive accuracy of development pathway coaches' perceptions when tasked with identifying adolescent athlete's long-term potential within the Australian Football talent pathway. A secondary aim was to explore if the maturational status of adolescent athletes influenced the accuracy of coaches' long-term career attainment predictions. This observational study initially recruited adolescent athletes (n = 264) and their coaches (n = 9) from teams involved in a state-based Australian Football competition. At the initial testing sessions, estimates for biological maturity were undertaken for all athletes and coaches were asked to rate the perceived long-term career attainment potential of their athletes via a questionnaire. Four years after this initial questionnaire, the research team retrospectively examined each athlete's highest level of competition attained. Coaches correctly predicted the level of career attainment for 63% of athletes, demonstrating a fair level of agreement (κ = 0.25, 95% CI = −0.16–0.35, p < 0.001) between coach perception and actual career progression outcomes. The coaches' greatest level of predictive accuracy was for late maturing athletes (79% accuracy), while the poorest was for the early maturing athletes (52% accuracy). The findings of this study highlight the complexity associated with correctly identifying athletes with long-term performance potential at early stages of development pathways.

Design: Prospective cohort study. Participants were followed for the whole soccer season included the pre-season (52 days) and competitive season (178 days). Setting: Recruitments and data collection were conducted in the Austin Aztex Football Club played in the United Soccer League. Participants (or Animals, Specimens, Cadavers): Twenty male professional soccer players (24.15 ± 2.54 years)volunteered to participate. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measure(s): FMC was assessed by the Advanced Lower Extremity Sports Assessment (ALESA) which contains eight subtests: (1) single leg hop (SLH), (2) single leg triple crossover hops (SLTCH), (3) side hops (SH), (4) figure-of-eight hops (Fig8), (5) modified agility T-test (MAT), (6) single leg squats (SLS), (7) single leg hops: stick series (SLHS), and (8) single leg balance (SLB). Limb symmetry index (LSI) was obtained by calculating the performance difference between non- and dominant legs. Sports injuries were reported and recorded daily by athletes and trainers. Multivariate Cox regression model and backward elimination method were used to identify and determine significant survival probability predictors. Results: In the final survival model showing evident predictability of in-season injuries (Chi2(df=6) = 24.22, p <.001, R2 =.702), the SLB (HR= 0.73, z = 2.28, p=.022), MAT (HR= 0.86, z= 1.86, p=.063), and LSI (HR= 0.71, z= 2.6, p=.009) significantly, negatively correlate to survival probability, which means the better FMC the less possibility to get injured in season. Conclusions: This study confirmed pre-season injury as an important risk factor, and the FMC measured by the ALESA also has excellent injury predictability.

Twenty-three subjects from the university's football team were recruited from an Exercise Science 100 conditioning class to participate in a 15-week off-season training program. Phase I consisted of concurrent strength and speed/endurance training (3-4 d·wk) for 7 weeks. Phase II consisted of strength training and spring football practice (3-4 d·wk) for 4 weeks. Countermovement jump, estimated one repetition maximum (1RM) bench press and back squat, 505 change of direction (COD), repeated 30-yard anaerobic sprint test (RAST), and body mass were all measured Pre, Mid, and Post training program. Two-way analysis of variance with repeated measures revealed no significant interaction between linemen and nonline players for all performance variables (p > 0.05). Over the course of the study, RSAT % decrement, 505 COD times, and estimated 1RM performance for bench and squat significantly improved (p ≤ 0.05). No significant changes were detected in CMJ, RSAT best time, or body mass. Results indicate that linemen and non-line players did not respond significantly different to the present training program. The 15-week training program produced improvements in COD skill, speed, anaerobic capacity, and muscular strength. Furthermore, all performance changes were maintained through the end of the study.

Fifteen elite rugby sevens players (90 ± 12 kg; 181 ± 8 cm; 26 ± 5 y) participated in the maximal sprinting test. A subset of five players participated in the concurrent validity and between-devices reliability study. A concurrent validity protocol compared the GPS units and a radar device (Stalker ATS II). The between-device reliability of the GPS signal during maximal sprint running was also assessed using 6 V2 GPS units (Sensoreverywhere, Digital Simulation, Paris, France) attached to a custom-made steel sled and pushed by the five athletes who performed a combined total of 15 linear 40m sprints. CV ranged from 0.5, ±0.1 % for MSS and smoothed MSS to 6.4, ±1.1 % for Amax. TEM was trivial for MSS and smoothed MSS (0.09, ±0.01) and small for Amax and smoothed Amax (0.54, ±0.09 and 0.39, ±0.06 respectively). Mean bias ranged from -1.6, ±1.0 % to -3.0, ±1.1 % for smoothed MSS and MSS respectively. TEE were small (2.0, ±0.55 to 1.6, ±0.4 %, for MSS and smoothed MSS respectively. The main results indicate that the GPS units were highly reliable for assessing MSS and provided acceptable signal to noise ratio for measuring Amax, especially when a smoothing 0.5-s moving average is used. This 16 Hz GPS device provides sport scientists and coaches with an accurate and reliable means to monitor running performance in elite rugby sevens.

This preliminary prospective case series aimed to determine if an inertial sensor instrumented Y balance test can capture changes in dynamic balance, regardless of apparent `clinical recovery', in six concussed elite rugby union players. The findings from this case series demonstrate that the inertial sensor-based measures can detect clinically meaningful changes in dynamic balance performance, not captured by the traditional clinical scoring methods, 48-hours post-injury and at the point of `clinical recovery' (return to play).

All data were collected prior to the beginning of the competitive season. The sample of this study was composed of 48 male soccer players divided into three groups: Under 17 (n=16), Under 19 (n=16) and Professional (n=16). To evaluate anthropometric characteristics, height and body composition were performed by means of air displacement pletismography. For determination of the motor characteristics the aerobic resistance test (Yo-Yo IR1), Counter movement jump (CMJ), Squat jump (SJ), performance of 5m and 30 m sprint and anaerobic power (RAST test) to determine the maximum, mean and minimum power were performed. To determine the differences between the categories regarding anthropometric and motor characteristics, a one-way ANOVA complemented with Bonferroni post-hoc test was used, with a level of significance of p>0,016.

Data were produced through semi-structured interviews and a biographical mapping grid. The theoretical framework of 'careership' was employed to understand the data. The results showed homogenous career paths. Moreover, the data show that the players decided at a young age to pursue a career in soccer; experienced the transition from junior to senior level soccer as difficult because of a lack of physical preparedness; soccer over school commitments. We recommend that soccer stakeholders (e.g. federations, clubs, coaches) give the transition from junior to senior level soccer special attention to prevent intense demands that may cause dropout. We further propose that if athletes should give sport and education equal priority, the Swedish dual career concept of high school education and sport needs further reflection and adjustment.

J.","A case of atypical hip pain in an Ethiopian soccer player","Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine","","1536-3724","10.1097/JSM.0000000000000728","","History: A 33 year old Ethiopian male recreational soccer player presented to our sports medicine center with a 6 month history of progressive right anterior hip pain with radiation into the right groin and anterior thigh. His pain worsened with prolonged sitting and with hip extension. He denied any specific injury or new activity associated with the pain. He denied any radiation down the leg, fevers, chills or swollen joints. He had a history of HIV with an undetectable viral load and was currently on antiretroviral therapy. His family history was significant for one brother with history of pulmonary tuberculosis. He recently emigrated from Ethiopia and was working as a driver for a ride sharing company. He was otherwise healthy and physically fit. Physical Exam: He exhibited a non-antalgic gait. Hip range of motion was reduced in flexion and external rotation. Hip external rotation, FABER and Stinchfield tests all reproduced his typical groin pain that radiated to the anterior thigh. Lower extremity strength was normal and reflexes were physiologic and symmetric. No rashes, lymphadenopathy or swollen joints were appreciated. Differential Diagnosis: Hip Osteoarthritis Acetabular Labral Tear Femoral Neck Stress Fracture Upper Lumbar Radiculopathy Septic Hip Test Results: CBC was normal. CRP was elevated. Hip x-ray showed mild degenerative changes. MRI revealed right hip synovitis with chronic erosive changes and cystic/necrotic pelvic lymphadenopathy suggestive of PVNS versus Tuberculosis (TB) arthritis. Pelvic lymph node biopsy showed granulomatous inflammation with focal necrosis. Synovial fluid and lymph node tissue cultures including fungal and Acid Fast Bacilli were negative. QuantiFERON test was negative. No pulmonary disease was found on chest CT. Final Diagnosis: Right Hip Erosive Arthritis, Presumed to be Secondary to TB Infection. Discussion: Intra-articular hip pain is a common presentation in our sports medicine clinic, but this patient's age, atraumatic onset, past medical and social history prompted further evaluation. TB is a rare cause of infectious arthritis and in the developed world is most commonly seen in patients with concomitant HIV. The granulomatous changes on his MRI suggested the possibility of TB, but the gold standard is identification on Acid-Fast Bacilli culture. Synovial biopsy can be performed for identification when the synovial fluid culture is negative. After diagnosis, medical treatment for eradication of TB may be accompanied by an arthroplasty depending upon the extent of erosive damage. Outcome: Repeat imaging after clinical decompensation showed a new right ischiorectal abscess. He underwent limited right hip excisional biopsy and incision and drainage of the ischiorectal abscess. Both sites cultured pan-sensitive Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Triple therapy with rifabutin, isoniazid and pyrazinamide was started. After surgery, he was dismissed to a subacute rehabilitation facility. Follow-up: After subacute rehabilitation, he transitioned home with outpatient physical therapy and underwent a 9 month course of triple therapy. He was followed closely by physiatry, orthopedic surgery and infectious disease specialists. After starting triple therapy, he had significant improvement in pain and function. He now ambulates with a cane but has not yet returned to playing soccer.","2019","2020-05-20 00:10:05","2020-05-20 00:10:05","","e7-e8","","2","29","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/JSM.0000000000000728; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629860473","sports medicine; adult; conference abstract; human; male; soccer player; case report; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; clinical article; thigh; thorax; follow up; range of motion; rotation; physiotherapy; gold standard; surgery; physical examination; human cell; nonhuman; abscess; acetabulum; antiretroviral therapy; arthroplasty; Bacilli; brother; chill; communicable disease; diagnosis; differential diagnosis; drug combination; drug therapy; Ethiopia; Ethiopian; family history; femoral neck; fever; gait; granulomatous inflammation; hip osteoarthritis; hip pain; Human immunodeficiency virus; incision; infectious arthritis; infectious disease specialist; inguinal pain; isoniazid; joint biopsy; joint swelling; lung tuberculosis; lymph node biopsy; necrosis; outpatient; pelvis lymph node; pyrazinamide; radiculopathy; rash; reflex; rehabilitation medicine; rifabutin; stress fracture; synovitis; tissue culture; tuberculosis; virus load; X ray","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While motor vehicle incidents are a known high-risk mechanism, we are the first to report on football injuries resulting in BCVI. Case Report: Case 1 is a 14-year-old male football player who presented with slurred speech and facial droop 16 h after injury that had resulted in unilateral stinger on the field. The patient had a negative brain computed tomography (CT) at the onset of symptoms. Given progression of symptoms over the next 24 h, re-evaluation with CT angiography (CTA) of brain and neck showed left internal carotid artery (ICA) dissection, and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed left middle cerebral artery infarct. Case 2 is a 16-year-old male football player who presented with headache and right hemiparesis immediately following a tackle injury. CT brain and neck were negative at an outside hospital, but he was transferred to us for progressive symptoms, and then CTA showed a left ICA dissection with distal emboli, including occlusive involvement of the intracranial left ICA. Why Should an Emergency Physician Be Aware of This?: The diagnosis of BCVI requires a high level of suspicion. Focal neurologic deficits are consistently a risk factor across all screening criteria, including the Denver, Utah, Memphis, and Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma. These current screening criteria, however, may not be sufficient to diagnosis BCVI in children. The addition of the mechanism of injury and attention to the patient's clinical presentation and examination are important to prevent missed diagnosis and poor neurologic outcomes.","2019","2020-05-20 00:10:06","2020-05-20 00:10:06","","554-559","","5","56","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jemermed.2019.01.029; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2001699264","football player; human; male; article; sport injury; case report; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; clinical article; priority journal; adolescent; follow up; head injury; internal carotid artery; hypertension; hospital discharge; leg injury; dizziness; self report; acetylsalicylic acid; artery catheterization; axonal injury; brain angiography; brain embolism; carotid artery obstruction; carotid artery stenting; carotid artery surgery; cerebrovascular accident; clopidogrel; computed tomographic angiography; computer assisted tomography; dissecting aneurysm; emergency health service; emergency ward; facial droop; Glasgow coma scale; hand paresthesia; headache; hemiparesis; heparin; hospital admission; interventional radiology; mental disease; neck pain; patient monitoring; patient transport; plavix; slurred speech; thrombectomy; vascular surgery; warfarin; weakness","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This case study examines possession regain patterns of an elite English Premier League team across three seasons from the 2015–16 season to the 2017–18 season (n = 106). A series of regressions are conducted in order to determine: what impact possession regains had on attacking performance, which players were most productive with possession post regains and which other factors influenced the number of successful possession regains by the subject team. Results revealed that possession regains in the opponent's half were highly significant and had a positive impact upon attacking performance (p = 0.006). Possession regains that occurred on the left-hand side of the playing field led to more productivity in front of goal (p = 0.028). The quality of the opponent was also revealed to have a significant impact upon the number of possession regains (p = 0.025). It is concluded that possession regains high up the playing field are crucial to the subject team's attacking success. Furthermore, players performing on the left side of the playing field were more productive with possession regains than those playing centrally or on the right.

Study 1 developed a standardized coding-scheme to examine verbal cognitions during a single soccer game. Study 2 then utilized this methodology to examine two full-time recruitment staff trained in the use of concurrent verbal reporting before undertaking a live, in-game task. Participants also participated in a debrief interview following the game. The findings of the two studies suggest that developing a verbal reporting protocol is viable, however when applied in a live-game environment it is problematic. Future research should therefore consider a modified version of this task to further explore the cognitions of scouts whilst observing and identifying potential talent.","2019","2020-05-20 00:10:09","2020-05-20 00:10:09","","","","11","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0225033; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2003761209","adult; female; human; human experiment; male; article; soccer; cognition; interview; verbal behavior","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Accordingly, we present a 38-week case study characterizing whole body and regional rates of muscle atrophy and hypertrophy (as inferred by assessments of fat-free mass from dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) in a professional male soccer player from the English Premier League. In addition, inWeek 6, we also quantified energy intake (via the remote food photographic method) and energy expenditure using the doubly labeled water method.Mean daily energy intake (CHO: 1.9-3.2, protein: 1.7-3.3, and fat: 1.4-2.7 g/kg) and energy expenditure were 2,765 ± 474 and 3,178 kcal/day, respectively. In accordance with an apparent energy deficit, total body mass decreased by 1.9 kg duringWeeks 1-6 where fat-free mass loss in the injured and noninjured limb was 0.9 and 0.6 kg, respectively, yet, trunk fat-free mass increased by 0.7 kg. In Weeks 7-28, the athlete was advised to increase daily CHO intake (4-6 g/kg) to facilitate an increased daily energy intake. Throughout this period, total bodymass increased by 3.6 kg (attributable to a 2.9 and 0.7 kg increase in fat free and fat mass, respectively). Our data suggest it may be advantageous to avoid excessive reductions in energy intake during the initial 6-8 weeks post anterior cruciate ligament surgery so as to limit muscle atrophy.","2019","2020-05-20 00:10:10","2020-05-20 00:10:10","","559-566","","5","29","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1123/ijsnem.2018-0391; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2004195356","adult; human; male; article; soccer player; case report; clinical article; body mass; food intake; resistance training; anterior cruciate ligament injury; knee meniscus rupture; professional athlete; anthropometry; muscle injury; caloric intake; energy expenditure; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; fat free mass; doubly labeled water technique; ligament surgery; muscle atrophy; muscle hypertrophy; rehabilitation care","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Technological advances have contributed to the development of new devices measuring external and internal load during training and competition in sports. Heart rate (HR) is one of the most studied and utilized variables for internal load control. Currently, heart rate monitors have been integrated onto sport clothes in order to increase athletes’ comfortability. Therefore, it is important to know validity and accuracy of their measurements so that they can be used in real game situations. Objective. To compare two methods of detection of HR: through a technical shirt (Kalenji®, Kiprum Cardio), and with a previously validated method (GARMIN®- WIMU PROTM). Methods. A total of 16 Under-19 national-level footballers (age: 17.2±0.87 years old; height: 1.77 ± 0.05 m; weight: 73.96±4.2 kg; BMI: 21.5±1.1 kg/m²) participated voluntarily in this study. An 8vs8 game in a reduced area was performed (67.5 x 38.2 meters, 184.18 m² per player, excluding goalkeepers). Statistical analysis was composed by Pearson correlation coefficient, intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), and Bland-Altman test. Results. A nearly perfect correlation was found between the HR telemetry methods (ICC=1.00; r=0.99). Very low differences were found between the two contact methods (Bias=0.01 ± 1.09; CV=1.59%), independently of activity intensities. Conclusions. The electrodes incorporated on the technical shirts represent a valid method to measure heart rate telemetry at different intensities in soccer. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR Justificación.

During a period of discriminatory practices and attitudes towards Irish descended Catholics in Scotland, this iconic win for a Scottish based club born of Irish Catholics personified for this diaspora that (on one level) their day had arrived. This article explores the socio-cultural significance and legacy of 'Lisbon 67ʹ for insider and outsider groups in Scotland.

Despite the increasing occurrence and prevalence of SRC, its underlying mechanism and recovery course have yet to be fully elucidated. The National Collegiate Athletic Association–Department of Defense Grand Alliance: Concussion Assessment, Research and Education (CARE) Consortium is a large-scale, multisite study of the natural history of concussion across multiple sports. The Advanced Research Core (ARC) of CARE is focused on the advanced biomarker assessment of a reduced subject cohort. This paper reports findings from two ARC sites to evaluate cerebral blood flow (CBF) changes in acute SRC, as measured using advanced arterial spin labeling (ASL) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We compared relative CBF maps assessed in 24 concussed contact sport athletes obtained at 24–48 h after injury to those of a control group of 24 matched contact sport players. Significantly less CBF was detected in several brain regions in concussed athletes, while clinical assessments also indicated clinical symptom and performance impairments in SRC patients. Correlations were found between decreased CBF in acute SRC and clinical assessments, including Balance Error Scoring System total score and Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Test memory composite and impulse control composite scores, as well as days from injury to asymptomatic. Although using different ASL MRI sequences, our preliminary results from two sites are consistent with previous reports and suggest that advanced ASL MRI methods might be useful for detecting acute neurobiological changes in acute SRC.","2019","2020-05-20 00:10:18","2020-05-20 00:10:18","","1375-1385","","5","13","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L623896474; http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11682-018-9946-5","adult; female; human; male; article; football; soccer; sport injury; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; brain concussion; clinical article; priority journal; young adult; brain blood flow; reaction time; verbal memory; visual memory; ice hockey; clinical assessment; traumatic brain injury; contact athlete; lacrosse (sport); arterial spin labeling; Balance Error Scoring System; brain injury assessment; brain region; cognition assessment; cognitive efficiency; contact sport; image processing; Immediate Post Concussion Assessment And Cognitive Test; inferior parietal lobule; middle frontal gyrus; motor speed; multicenter study; neuroimaging; occipital gyrus; posterior cingulate; supplementary impulse control; supramarginal gyrus; thalamus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

J Strength Cond Res 33(5): 1192-1200, 2019—We hypothesized that (a) high-level specialized sport training causes different adaptations that induce specific biomarker release dynamics during exercise and recovery and (b) skeletal muscle mass affects biomarker release. Eleven sprinters (21 -30 years), 16 endurance runners (18-31 years), 12 futsal players (18-29 years), and 12 amateur runners as controls (22-33 years) were examined. Hypoxanthine (Hx), xanthine (X), uric acid (UA), ammonia (NH3), and lactate (LA) concentrations were determined at rest, during an incremental treadmill exercise test (every 3 minutes), and during recovery (5, 10, 15, 20, and 30 minutes after exercise). Hx, X, and UA concentration was determined from plasma, while LA and NH3 from whole blood, and muscle mass was assessed using dual X-ray absorptiometry method. At rest, during incremental exercise, and up to 30 minutes into the postexercise recovery period, sprinters had lowest Hx, X, and UA concentrations, and endurance athletes had lowest NH3 concentrations. For LA during exercise, the lowest concentrations were noted in endurance athletes, except when reaching maximum intensity, where the differences between groups were not significant. There were no significant correlations observed between skeletal muscle mass and biomarker concentration at maximal intensity and recovery in any group. In conclusion, the magnitude of exercise-induced biomarker concentration is only related to training adaptations through specific training profile but not to muscle mass. In addition, the results suggest that combined measuring of LA, NH3, and Hx concentration in blood is useful in indirectly reflecting key changes in exercise- and training-induced energy status. Further research should focus on studying how specific training sessions affect individual biomarker response in highly trained athletes.

However, there has not been a study that has shown the effectiveness of both the arch and heel features in the same orthosis. This study quantitatively analyzed if the calcaneal pitch and the heel pad thickness will be affected by the use of an arch support and heel cup insole in a static weightbearing stance while wearing sports shoes. Methods: Twenty-four (24) feet from 12 elite-level female soccer players with a mean age of 25 ± 3.99 years (20–33 years old) were studied. Lateral weightbearing radiographs with and without orthotics were obtained in order to measure the calcaneal pitch angle and heel fat pad thickness for each foot. A subjective outcome measure was used and the scores were classified as bad (0–2), fair (3–5), good (6–8), or excellent (9-10). Results: The calcaneal pitch angle increased in all but three cases by an average of 1.05° (range, −1.14 to 3.19) after wearing orthotics (p < 0.01). The heel fat pad thickness increased in all cases with an average of 1.25 mm (range, 1.05 to 1.47; p < 0.01)). 9 of 12 subjects (75%) reported excellent (n = 2) or good (n = 7) overall subjective scores with insole wear. Conclusion: Under static weightbearing conditions, the arch support and heel cup features of a foot orthosis help improve the height of the calcaneal pitch and the thickness of the heel fat pad, respectively.","2019","2020-05-20 00:10:22","2020-05-20 00:10:22","","21-24","","","17","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.asmart.2019.07.001; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002432285","adult; female; human; male; article; soccer player; clinical article; priority journal; controlled study; outcome assessment; fatigue; normal human; thickness; quantitative analysis; ankle pain; calcaneus; fat pad; heel; heel pain; orthopedic shoe; orthotics; weight bearing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We expanded our knowledge of the training load and its influence on the disjunctive reaction speed, which is one of the limiting factors of the individual game performance of goalkeepers. There was an assumption of changes in the disjunctive reaction time of goalkeepers from different age categories in the selected training load zones. The research group was formed by eight elite soccer goalkeepers (n = 8) from U15, U16, U17 and U19 categories. The disjunctive reaction time was evaluated by means of the FiTRO Agility Check test that provided us with the values of the disjunctive reaction time of every goalkeeper involved. The POLAR heart rate monitor was used to evaluate the heart rate and the loading zones of goalkeepers were determined using a program called POLAR Team2. Subsequently, the obtained data were evaluated by using the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test and Cohen's „r” (effect size). We found out a statistically significant relationship between the value of the disjunctive reaction time by the observed goalkeepers in the calm zone (50-59 % HRmax) and in the 90-100 % HRmax zone.

We sought to determine the effectiveness of sprint interval training (SIT) on changing performance and lactate kinetics in adolescent soccer players. Thirteen elite soccer academy players (age 15 ± 0.5y) underwent baseline testing (0-10m and 10-20m sprint performance, Wingate anaerobic Test (WaNT) with blood lactate measurements and incremental VO2 peak test) before being allocated to control or SIT group. The control group maintained training whilst the HIT group carried out twice-weekly all-out effort cycle sprints consisting of 6 x 10sec sprint with 80sec recovery. There were significant time x group interactions for 10- 20m sprint time (Control pre: 1.32 ± 0.07s post: 1.35 ± 0.08s; SIT pre: 1.29 ± 0.04s post: 1.25 ± 0.04s; p=0.01), Peak Power (Control pre: 13.1 ± 1.3W.kg-1 post: 13.2 ± 1.47 W.kg-1; SIT pre: 12.4 ± 1.3 W.kg-1 post: 15.3 ± 0.7W.kg-1; p=0.01) and time to exhaustion (Control pre: 596 ± 62s post: 562 ± 85s; SIT pre: 655 ± 54s post: 688 ± 55s; p=0.001). The changes in performance were significantly correlated to changes in lactate kinetics (power: r=0.55; 10-20m speed: r=-0.54; time to exhaustion: r=0.55). Therefore, cycle based SIT is an effective training paradigm for elite adolescent soccer players and the improvements in performance are associated with changes in lactate kinetics.","2019","2020-05-20 00:10:25","2020-05-20 00:10:25","","1-24","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17461391.2019.1635650; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628461686","human; article; soccer player; aerobic capacity; controlled study; team sport; adolescent; physiology; juvenile; group dynamics; exhaustion; lactic acid; lactate blood level; kinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Twenty elite rugby sevens players performed ten 40 m sprints on a 30 s cycle with participant's running back and forth in a marked lane. Radar was used to assess maximal overground sprint performance over each 40 m. Macroscopic mechanical properties (maximal horizontal force (F0), maximal horizontal power (Pmax), maximal ratio of horizontal force (RFpeak), decrease in the ratio of horizontal-to-total force (DRF), total force and maximal sprinting velocity (v0)) were drawn from horizontal force velocity relationships, using a validated method applied to the speed–time data. Fatigue-induced changes were analysed comparing the first sprint to an average of 2nd-4th, 5th-7th and 8th-10th. Repeated-sprint ability (RSA) testing induced substantial changes in the maximal velocity component, with a decrease (–15%) in v0 (effect size (ES) = –2.46 to –4.98), and to a lower extent (–5.9%) in the maximal force component F0 (ES = –0.59). DRF moderately decreased (14%; ES=–0.76–1.11), and RFpeak largely decreased in the later sprints (ES = –0.32 to –1.27). Fatigue observed in this RSA test appeared to have a greater effect on the technical ability to produce horizontal force at high velocities, likely due to an alteration in the ability to maintain horizontally oriented force application when velocity increases rather than during the initial acceleration phase, but also the overall force production capacity. The ability to maintain forward-oriented force at high velocities is of central importance for identifying fatigue and monitoring load.

Exposure data collected from g-Force accelerometers mounted to the helmet of each player were used to split participants into HIGH (N = 22) and LOW (N = 22) exposure groups, based on the frequency of impacts sustained by each athlete. Significant decreases in grey-matter volume specific to the HIGH group were documented at POST (P = 0.009), compared to baseline. Changes in resting cerebral blood flow (CBF0), corrected for partial volume effects, were observed within the HIGH group, throughout the season (P < 0.0001), suggesting that alterations in perfusion may follow exposure to sub-concussive collisions. Co-localized significant increases in cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption (CMRO2|0) mid-season were also documented in the HIGH group, with respect to both PRE- and POST values. No physiological changes were observed in the LOW group. Therefore, cerebral metabolic demand may be elevated in players with greater exposure to head impacts. These results provide novel insight into the effects of sub-concussive collisions on brain structure and cerebrovascular physiology and emphasize the importance of multi-modal imaging for a complete characterization of cerebral health.","2019","2020-05-20 00:10:28","2020-05-20 00:10:28","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0271678X19862861; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628862646","adult; human; article; clinical article; controlled study; season; accelerometer; athlete; helmet; physiology; brain blood flow; brain metabolism; cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen; functional magnetic resonance imaging; gravity; gray matter; metabolic parameters; multimodal imaging; partial volume (imaging); perfusion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of the study was to evaluate whether these evolutions are also been reflected in changes in anthropometric and fitness characteristics between former (2002 to 2005) and current (2012 to 2015) elite Austrian youth development center (U13 to U14) and soccer academy (U15 to U18) players. A battery of anthropometric, general and soccer-specific fitness tests was conducted annually at the end of each year. Independent t-test and Cohen's d (ES) were calculated to compare the two four-year periods (2530 vs. 2611 players) at each age group separately. Current players were significantly faster in 20 m sprint (ES = 0.26-0.50) and reaction test (ES = 0.15-0.39, except for U18), but less flexible at sit-and-reach (ES =-0.19 to-0.55), in all age categories. Whereas height (ES = 0.26-0.32), body mass (ES = 0.11-0.18) and countermovement jump (ES = 0.24-0.26) increased significantly at youth development center level, current academy players performed superior at shuttle sprint (ES = 0.21-0.59), hurdles agility run (ES = 0.24-0.49), and endurance run (ES = 0.11-0.20). These changes over time in speed, change-of-direction ability, lower-body power, coordination, and endurance were attributed to modern training approaches (e.g., modified games and change-of-direction drills) and modifications in selection politics (e.g., coaches favor speed and decision-making skills).","2019","2020-05-20 00:10:30","2020-05-20 00:10:30","","","","MAR","10","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2019.00333; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L627877037","human; article; football; soccer player; controlled study; velocity; decision making; juvenile; height; agility; endurance; anthropometry; skill; Austrian; coordination; politics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Players’ diet’s may differ with regard to the variety of physical efforts performed and their different nutritional needs. Objective: The aim of the study was to evaluate a diet and the supplementation, including the comparison of both the defensive and offensive player’s formations, which may constitute a background of sportsmen’ balanced menus permitting them to achieve better sports results. Material and methods: The study included 44 American football players (24 defensive, 20 offensive players). The study group completed a three-day-dietary recall containing the time of consumption as well as a questionnaire about a type and amount of supplements used, including questions of one or multiple choice. Results: The mean age of defensive players was 25.1±5.8 years, while of offensive players was 23.4±3.7. The mean body mass equaled 101±15.6 kg vs. 88.7±22.2 kg.

Total distance, very high intensity (above 21 km/h) running distance and the number of runs at very high intensity of 230 players from 20 teams in the Spanish First Division were analysed. The main findings of the study were that the performance indicators at very high intensities decreased from the first half to the second half for all outfield players (covered distance: 4694 ± 538 m vs 4485 ± 437 m, sprint distance: 256 ± 72 m vs 239 ± 67 m, number of sprints: 14.3 ± 3.5 vs 13.2 ± 3.1), except the central defenders (sprint distance: 166 ± 37 vs 166 ± 40 m, number of sprints: 10.0 ± 2.1 vs 9.8 ± 3.8). Secondly, although wide defenders (9759 ± 665 m) and central midfielders (9776 ± 942 m) covered the most distance during matches, it were the wide defenders (30 ± 5), centre-forwards (28 ± 7) and wide midfielders (31 ± 8) who performed the most runs at very high intensity. Consequently, the distance they ran at these very high intensity runs followed the same pattern. Such results enable general and specific profiles by demarcation to be established based on the demands of the game at high-level competitive play.

Twenty-nine players from two professional teams from Portugal and the Netherlands participated in this study. The players' external load was monitored for 7 weeks, by means of portable GPS devices (10 Hz, JOHAN, Noordwijk, Netherlands). Results revealed that match day -1 (MD-1), i.e. the training day before a match, had significantly (p = 0.001) less training volume (4584.50 m) than the other days. MD-5 (training five days before a match), MD-4 (four days before a match) and MD-3 (three days before a match) were the most intense (390.83, 176.90 and 247.32 m of sprinting distance, respectively) and with large volume (7062.66, 6077.30 and 6919.49 m, respectively). Interestingly, significant differences were found between clubs of different countries (p < 0.05) with the Portuguese team showing significantly higher intensity (sprinting distance) and volume (total distance) in all days with exception of MD-1 than the Dutch team. The results of this study possibly allow for the identification of different training workloads and tapering strategies between countries in relation to volume and intensity. It should be noted, however, that both clubs used a significant tapering phase in the last two days before the competition in an attempt to reduce residual fatigue accumulation.

Athletes were instrumented with custom-fit mouthpieces that measure head impacts. Detailed video analysis was conducted to identify characteristics describing impact source (e.g., kick, header, throw). A total of 763 verified head impacts were collected over 23 practices and 8 games from 7 athletes. The median peak linear accelerations, rotational velocities, and rotational accelerations of all impacts were 9.4 g, 4.1 rad/s, and 689 rad/s2, respectively. Pairwise comparisons resulted in statistically significant differences in kinematics by impact source. Headers following a kicked ball had the highest accelerations and velocity when compared to headers from thrown or another header.","2019","2020-05-20 00:10:37","2020-05-20 00:10:37","","1-17","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15438627.2019.1590833; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L626862126","female; human; article; soccer player; acceleration; adolescent; juvenile; videorecording; kinematics; head","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

L.","Chronic traumatic encephalopathy in athletes: The aftermath of repetitive head injuries","Brain Pathology","","1750-3639","10.1111/bpa.12675","","Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a brain disorder characterized by the intracytoplasmic accumulation of misfolded tau in neurons and glia, has been recognized to be caused by the repetitive head traumas associated with the practice of several types of contact sports. In the 1920-30' s, descriptions of the “punch drunk” neurological syndrome of professional pugilists were reported, and the first neuropathologic descriptions of boxers' brains were published 30-40 years later. The macroscopic and microscopic findings consisted of abnormalities of the septum pellucidum, cerebellar scarring, neurofibrillary degeneration, particularly severe in the temporal lobes, and degeneration of neurons of the substantia nigra and locus coeruleus. As early as the 1880's, concussions among college football players were already of concern; however, it was not until the mid 2000's that autopsies of former professional football players revealed the neuropathologic features of CTE, linking tau pathology to repetitive head injuries in footballers. CTE has recently been described in association with other sports, including soccer, rugby, mixed martial arts, and hockey. In 2016, neuropathologic criteria for CTE were established. In contrast to other tau pathologies, the spatial distribution of perivascular tau aggregates in neurons and glia, notably at the depth of sulci, is considered pathognomonic. Impact-injuries and distribution of brain changes may differ among athletes due to differences in the mechanisms of and/or risks for head injuries relevant to each sport. Individual genetic risks for the development of CTE may also contribute. At present, a definitive diagnosis of CTE is made only through postmortem neuropathology. However, Tau-PET neuroimaging and other biomarkers may lead to CTE diagnosis during life, possibly during early, even clinically silent, stages of disease. Biomarkers of early stages of neurodegeneration may be useful to recognize clinical stages of CTE and help identify individuals at risk for CTE for early treatment when novel therapies become available.","2019","2020-05-20 00:10:40","2020-05-20 00:10:40","","121-122","","","29","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bpa.12675; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L626770790","adult; conference abstract; football player; human; rugby; soccer; martial art; controlled study; concussion; hockey; genetic association; genetic risk; biological marker; endogenous compound; autopsy; diagnosis; contact sport; neuroimaging; boxer; cancer staging; cerebellum; chronic traumatic encephalopathy; college; congenital malformation; glia; locus ceruleus; nerve cell; nerve degeneration; neurofibrillary tangle; neuropathology; scar formation; septum pellucidum; substantia nigra; temporal lobe","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nevertheless, the contribution of CTE pathology to clinical presentation and its interaction with co-morbid neurodegenerative pathologies remain unclear. To address these issues, we performed comprehensive neuropathology assessments on the brains of former athletes with dementia and considered these findings together with detailed clinical histories to derive an integrated clinicopathological diagnosis for each case. Consecutive, autopsy-acquired brains from former soccer and rugby players with dementia were assessed for neurodegenerative pathologies using established and preliminary consensus protocols. Thereafter, next of kin interviews were conducted to obtain detailed accounts of the patient’s clinical presentation and course of disease to inform a final, integrated clinicopathological diagnosis. Neuropathologic change consistent with CTE (CTE-NC) was confirmed in five of seven former soccer and three of four former rugby players’ brains, invariably in combination with mixed, often multiple neurodegenerative pathologies. However, in just three cases was the integrated dementia diagnosis consistent with CTE, the remainder having alternate diagnoses, with the most frequent integrated diagnosis Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (four cases; one as mixed AD and vascular dementia). This consecutive autopsy series identifies neuropathologic change consistent with preliminary diagnostic criteria for CTE (CTE-NC) in a high proportion of former soccer and rugby players dying with dementia. However, in the majority, CTE-NC appears as a co-morbidity rather than the primary, dementia causing pathology. As such, we suggest that while CTE-NC might be common in former athletes with dementia, in many cases its clinical significance remains uncertain.","2019","2020-05-20 00:10:41","2020-05-20 00:10:41","","389-399","","3","138","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L627946670; http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00401-019-02030-y","adult; human; male; article; rugby; soccer; priority journal; human tissue; autopsy; aged; chronic traumatic encephalopathy; neuropathology; septum pellucidum; temporal lobe; alpha synuclein; amyloid beta protein; brain atrophy; clinical feature; comorbidity; degenerative disease; dementia; disease assessment; frontal lobe; hydrocephalus; TAR DNA binding protein; tau protein; vascular amyloidosis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In recent years, the two research groups in the USA who have led the field have asserted definitively that CTE is a delayed-onset and progressive neurodegenerative disease, with symptoms appearing in midlife or decades after exposure. Between 2005 and 2012 autopsy cases of former boxers and American football players described neuropathology attributed to CTE that was broad and diverse. This pathology, resulting from multiple causes, was aggregated and referred to, in toto, as the pathology ‘characteristic’ of CTE. Preliminary consensus criteria for defining the neuropathology of CTE were forged in 2015 and published in 2016. Most of the macroscopic and microscopic neuropathological findings described as characteristic of CTE, in studies published before 2016, were not included in the new criteria for defining the pathology. In the past few years, there has been steadily emerging evidence that the neuropathology described as unique to CTE may not be unique. CTE pathology has been described in individuals with no known participation in collision or contact sports and no known exposure to repetitive neurotrauma. This pathology has been reported in individuals with substance abuse, temporal lobe epilepsy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple system atrophy, and other neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, throughout history, some clinical cases have been described as not being progressive, and there is now evidence that CTE neuropathology might not be progressive in some individuals. Considering the current state of knowledge, including the absence of a series of validated sensitive and specific biomarkers, CTE pathology might not be inexorably progressive or specific to those who have experienced repetitive neurotrauma.","2019","2020-05-20 00:10:42","2020-05-20 00:10:42","","3672-3693","","12","142","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/brain/awz286; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L630869860","human; priority journal; high school; neurologic disease; recurrent disease; traumatic brain injury; disease exacerbation; contact athlete; chronic traumatic encephalopathy; neuropathology; clinical feature; tau protein; aging; aging related tau astrogliopathy; consensus; disease classification; microscopy; nervous system injury; phosphoprotein; primary age related tauopathy; protein phosphorylation; review; tauopathy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Background Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is considered to be a consequence of exposure to repeated head traumas, but evidence suggests that a single moderate or severe traumatic brain injury can also induce progressive neuropathological changes. Design/Methods Prospective observational study that evaluated 26 retired soccer players and 14 controls. The retired athletes and controls were submitted to neurological evaluation, neuropsychological evaluation and EEG. Results In general, the soccer players performed well in tests, within the normal range. 15 soccer players had a history of previous TBI/concussion. In the retired group the average age was 60.4 years (55.7 in the CG), average of 11.7 schooling years (13.7 in the CG). The average results in MMSE was 26.6 (29 in the CG), the average digit span in backwards was 3.1 (3.8 in the CG), the average verbal fluency for animals was 15.6 (24 in the CG) and the average clock-drawing test was 8.96 (9 in the CG). Visual EEG analysis showed a predominance of posterior alpha activity between 9.0 and 12.0 Hz (mean 10.3 Hz) in the soccer participants and 11 Hz in the control group (CG). The analysis wiht low resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) showed that 11 soccer players had hippocampal asymmetry (5 had less activity in the right hippocampus and 6 had less activity in the left hippocampus). Conclusions Although the performance of the athletes in the tests was within the normal range, the means were always inferior to those of the controls. Almost half of the players presented asymmetry in the analysis by LORETA, although visual EEG analysis was normal. This may indicate that EEG changes may be earlier and more sensitive than clinical changes. These data are preliminary and further analysis are needed.","2019","2020-05-20 00:10:44","2020-05-20 00:10:44","","S11","","14","93","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1212/01.wnl.0000580932.14660.5b; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629665753","adult; conference abstract; female; male; soccer player; observational study; controlled study; prospective study; concussion; nonhuman; chronic traumatic encephalopathy; alpha rhythm; animal experiment; animal model; clock drawing test; left hippocampus; low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography; Mini Mental State Examination; right hippocampus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we aimed to compare the expression of plasma miRNAs in amateur Australian rules footballers at baseline and various stages post-concussion. Methods: Baseline blood was collected during pre-season, and for the nine male footballers that sustained a concussion during the 2017 season, again at 24-48 hours, 6- and 13- days post-concussion. Controls included samples from sex-, age-, and education-matched athletes without a history of concussion, as well as 2-day post nonconcussive match samples. Plasma miRNA expression of 754 known miRNAs was analysed using OpenArray. Results: Preliminary findings revealed that levels of Let-7c, Let-7g, miR-17, miR-328 and miR-410 were significantly increased at 24-48 hours post-concussion when compared to baseline. These findings were validated with low throughput RT-PCR using a different normalization technique. Importantly, the lack of differences in expression of these miRNAs between baseline and the post non-concussive match controls may indicate specificity for concussion. Interestingly, plasma expression of miR-328 at 24-48 hours significantly correlated with both concussion symptom number and severity at this time-point. Analysis of samples obtained from the 2018 season, which also includes female footballers, is ongoing. Conclusion: These preliminary findings suggest that miRNAs may be able to indicate the occurrence of sports-related concussion.","2019","2020-05-20 00:10:45","2020-05-20 00:10:45","","A104","","13","36","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2019.29100.abstracts; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628868490","adult; conference abstract; female; football player; human; male; controlled study; season; sport; concussion; human tissue; biological marker; endogenous compound; education; protein expression; circulating microRNA; gene expression; plasma; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, the objective of this research was to describe the levels of anxiety and motivational climate perceived by athletes, as well as to analyze the differences between the levels of motivation perceived and anxiety levels in 154 federated soccer players between 16 and 18 years of age (16.96 ± 0.77) from lower division (Honor Division, National, Preferred, First Provincial and Second Provincial). The subjects were evaluated through a Motivational Climate Questionnaire (PMCQS-2) and the anxiety inventory (STAI). The results indicate that soccer players degenerate in high levels of anxiety and state-anxiety. In terms of motivational climate, the players mostly perceive a motivational climate of involvement in the task. Athletes with a motivational perception of involvement demonstrated average levels of anxiety, while subjects with a lower motivational perception with involvement in the task were found with high levels of anxiety. It is important to pay attention to the existing associations between the perceived motivational climate and the levels of anxiety of athletes in the psychological training of the trainers in lower soccer divisions, promoting motivational climates oriented towards task and intervening through the use of relaxation techniques in order to decrease anxiety levels. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR La motivación y la ansiedad representan factores psicológicos fundamentales en el contexto deportivo, por su estrecha relación con el rendimiento deportivo, por lo que la presente investigación tiene como objetivos describir los niveles de ansiedad y clima motivacional percibido de los deportistas estudiados, y analizar las diferencias entre el clima motivacional percibido y los niveles de ansiedad en una muestra de futbolistas de categorías inferiores, compuesta por un total de 154 jugadores de fútbol federados de entre 16 y 18 años de edad (16,96±.77), pertenecientes a las categorías División de Honor, Nacional, Preferente, Primera Provincial y Segunda Provincial. Los sujetos fueron evaluados mediante un cuestionario de Clima Motivacional (PMCQS-2) y el inventario de ansiedad (STAI). Los resultados indican que los futbolistas de categorías inferiores presentan niveles elevados de ansiedad-estado y ansiedad-rasgo; en cuanto al clima motivacional, los futbolistas analizados perciben en su mayoría un clima motivacional de implicación a la tarea. Los deportistas con una percepción motivacional de implicación a la tarea muestran niveles medios de ansiedad-estado, mientras que los sujetos con una menor percepción motivacional con implicación a la tarea tienen niveles de ansiedad alta.

This study used data from the authors’ clinical department to retrospectively investigate the clinical characteristics of sport-related concussion and factors associated with delays in examinations. Methods: The study included 38 patients with sport-related concussions who were treated at the authors’ hospital. The sports during which the injuries occurred, occasions of injury, factors affecting the time from injury until examination at hospital, and prognoses were evaluated retrospectively. Results: Sport-related concussions most frequently occurred in rugby and judo, where tackling, throwing, and other types of physical contact can result in impacts to the head region at high angular or linear velocity with acceleration. Some subjects showed consciousness disturbance and/or clear subjective symptoms immediately after the injury and were therefore examined at the hospital rapidly. However, other subjects who suffered amnesia or less obvious symptoms continued to play after the injury and had delayed examinations. In addition, there was a tendency for examinations to be delayed when an on-site physician was present. Conclusions: In contact sports where injury-resulting events occur, such as impacts to the head at high angular or linear velocity with acceleration, athletes should be immediately withdrawn from play and evaluated for concussion, even if there are no obvious head injuries or symptoms. The immediate ascertainment of symptoms after physical contact would improve the rapid detection of sport-related concussion.","2019","2020-05-20 00:10:50","2020-05-20 00:10:50","","49-53","","1","6","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ams2.376; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L624811247","adult; female; human; male; article; rugby; sport injury; acceleration; clinical article; priority journal; athlete; cohort analysis; concussion; young adult; retrospective study; prognosis; head injury; clinical examination; early diagnosis; clinical feature; amnesia; consciousness disorder; delayed diagnosis; general practitioner; hospital department; judo; rapid test; sports and sport related phenomena; tackling; throwing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A braided suture and a threaded sleeve containing a preloaded spring fixed into the proximal tibia provides continuous biomechanical stability. In combination with mircofracturing, self-healing of the ACL is promoted. Materials and Methods: Between January and November 2013 65 patients with an acute ACL rupture treated by Dynamic Intraligamentary Stabilisation (DIS) were included in this prospective study. Inclusion criteria were acute ACL injury, a positive Lachman test compared to the healthy contralateral side and closed growth plates. The following demographic patient data was preoperatively recorded: Age, gender, weight, activity scores (Tegner, Lysholm, IKDC), type of injury, ap-Translation of both knees measured by KT-1000 or Rolimeter, knee function and prior surgeries to the knees. Furthermore pivot shift test, acl rupture type, days until surgery, operating time, preexisting pathologies and concomitant injuries were detected during surgery. The result of the reconstruction was assessed by rating it as anatomical, almost anatomical or non-Anatomical. Patients were followed-up at 6 weeks, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years and 5 years after surgery. Patient satisfaction was detected recorded on a visual analog scale (VAS) scale from 0-10. Results: 34 men and 31 women were included. Mean age was 32.6 years (range 15 to 62 years). More than 70 % of the injuries were soccer or handball associated. In 24 patients meniscal tears had to be repaired and in 4 patients cartilage damages had to be treated. All patients could be examinated 5 years after surgery. Within the follow up period 8 reruptures occured which were treated by one-step ACL reconstruction using an ipsilateral semitendinosus autograft. 4 patients had to be revised performing an arthrolysis due to extension deficit. At 5 years, Tegner Score averaged at 4.9 (compared to 5.5 pre-operatively). IKDC had an average of 90 (98). Lysholm score was at 95 (99). Patient satisfaction was 8.5. Conclusion: With the use of DIS, ACL preserving restoration of knee joint kinematics and mid-Term survival of the repaired ACL after acute acl rupture can be achieved. Perioperative morbidity is reduced since harvesting of tendon grafts is not required. In case of recurrent instability or rerupture, conventional ACL reconstruction can still be performed. Knee function scores have shown a good rehabilitation and return to pre-Trauma activity levels. However, long-Term results are required to confirm safety and effectivity of the presented technique.","2019","2020-05-20 00:10:51","2020-05-20 00:10:51","","","","6","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2325967119S00239; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628915291","adult; conference abstract; female; human; male; soccer; major clinical study; prospective study; adolescent; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; follow up; gender; preoperative evaluation; outcome assessment; knee function; anterior cruciate ligament injury; knee meniscus rupture; patient satisfaction; visual analog scale; kinematics; epiphysis plate; semitendinous muscle; arthrolysis; arthrometer; cartilage; clinical outcome; Lysholm score; morbidity; operation duration; patient coding; patient history of surgery; Tegner activity score; tendon graft","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The period of time for return to sport, post-ORIF, has been reported in the literature with considerable range. Return to sport times for NFL athletes are reported to typically require three to seven months, while professional cyclists have resumed training in only one week. As the percentage of clavicle fractures in athletes is likely dominated by the high school and college populations, it is clinically relevant to evaluate the success of specific return to sport protocols after clavicle ORIF with respect to age. To evaluate this aspect of care, a retrospective study utilizing an adolescent/immediate postadolescent and an adult control patient was performed. Methods: A single surgeon performed locking plate ORIF of clavicle fractures with patient population of athletes, ages 13 to 22 years old (mean 16.7 yrs.), and an adult control group (mean 50.8 yrs.). A uniform period for return to sport of two months was utilized for the athlete group, unless complications were present. The athlete group contained 90 patients, and the adult control group contained 64 patients. The athlete group had 48% of fractures resulting from football. High energy mechanisms (auto accident, ATV accident, etc.) accounted for 23.3% of the athlete group fractures, while these mechanisms accounted for 46.9% of the adult group fractures. Post-operative complications and adverse outcomes were monitored for a minimum period of one year. Results: Clavicle fractures within both patient groups were dominantly midshaft fractures with 97.7% of the athlete fractures and 88.5% of the adult fractures being located midshaft. The athlete group exhibited minimal postoperative complication/adverse outcomes with one patient reporting pain with weightlifting and two patients requiring minor scar revisions, for a total complication/adverse outcome rate of 3.3%. The adult group included ten patients with significant residual pain and one patient requiring revision for non-union, yielding a total complication/adverse outcome rate of 15.6% in this group. Applying a Chi-square analysis, a statistically significant difference in complication/adverse outcome rates exist between the patient groups (p=0.003). Additionally, all patients in the athlete group, desiring to return to their sport, did so within the two-month post-operative period. Conclusion: Locking plate ORIF of midshaft clavicle fractures allowed for a successful two month return to sport, with a low occurrence of complications, for a young athlete patient group.

The period of time for return to sport, post-ORIF, has been reported in the literature with considerable range. Return to sport times for NFL athletes are reported to typically require three to seven months, while professional cyclists have resumed training in only one week. As the percentage of clavicle fractures in athletes is likely dominated by the high school and college populations, it is clinically relevant to evaluate the success of specific return to sport protocols after clavicle ORIF with respect to age. To evaluate this aspect of care, a retrospective study utilizing an adolescent/immediate post-adolescent and an adult control patient was performed. Methods: A single surgeon performed locking plate ORIF of clavicle fractures with patient population of athletes, ages 13 to 22 years old (mean 16.7 yrs.), and an adult control group (mean 50.8 yrs.). A uniform period for return to sport of two months was utilized for the athlete group, unless complications were present. The athlete group contained 90 patients, and the adult control group contained 64 patients. The athlete group had 48% of fractures resulting from football. High energy mechanisms (auto accident, ATV accident, etc.) accounted for 23.3% of the athlete group fractures, while these mechanisms accounted for 46.9% of the adult group fractures. Post-operative complications and adverse outcomes were monitored for a minimum period of one year. Results: Clavicle fractures within both patient groups were dominantly midshaft fractures with 97.7% of the athlete fractures and 88.5% of the adult fractures being located midshaft. The athlete group exhibited minimal post-operative complication/adverse outcomes with one patient reporting pain with weightlifting and two patients requiring minor scar revisions, for a total complication/adverse outcome rate of 3.3%. The adult group included ten patients with significant residual pain and one patient requiring revision for non-union, yielding a total complication/adverse outcome rate of 15.6% in this group. Applying a Chi-square analysis, a statistically significant difference in complication/adverse outcome rates exist between the patient groups (p=0.003). Additionally, all patients in the athlete group, desiring to return to their sport, did so within the two-month post-operative period. Conclusion: Locking plate ORIF of midshaft clavicle fractures allowed for a successful two month return to sport, with a low occurrence of complications, for a young athlete patient group. High energy fracture events and an adult aged patient group were associated with higher rates of adverse clinical outcome.","2019","2020-05-20 00:10:54","2020-05-20 00:10:54","","1-1","","","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","","","","https://gateway.library.qut.edu.au/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=c8h&AN=142182705&site=ehost-live&scope=site","Adult; Adolescence; Congresses and Conferences -- Massachusetts; Massachusetts; Sports Re-Entry; Clavicle Fractures -- Surgery -- In Adolescence; Clavicle Fractures -- Surgery -- In Adulthood; Fracture Fixation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: A retrospective review was conducted for patients who underwent arthroscopic microfracture surgery for osteochondral lesions of the tibial plafond from January 2014 to June 2017. For functional evaluation, the visual analog scale (VAS) pain score, Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM) score, and Short Form-12 (SF-12) general health questionnaire were used. We also investigated the level of sports activity before and after the surgery. Sixteen patients were included in this study, and the mean follow-up period was 29.8 months. Results: The mean VAS score improved from 8.3 (range, 6-10) preoperatively to 1.8 (range, 0-4) postoperatively. The mean FAAM score was improved from 57.6 (range, 6.0-88.9) for the activities of daily living subscale and 34.5 (range, 3.1-92.6) for the sports subscale to 84.3 (range, 46.4-100.0) and 65.2 (range, 23.3-55.1) for each subscale, respectively, at the final follow-up. There were also improvements in the SF-12 score, from 36.3 (range, 23.3-55.1) preoperatively to 46.0 (range, 18.9-56.6) postoperatively for the SF-12 PCS, and from 41.3 (range, 14.2-65.0) preoperatively to 52.6 (range, 32.8-60.8) postoperatively for the SF-12 MCS. All functional scores showed significant differences clinically and statistically at the final follow-up. The level of sports activity after the surgery was significantly lower than their level before the surgery (P =.012). Conclusion: Arthroscopic microfracture provided satisfactory clinical outcomes for osteochondral lesions of the tibial plafond. Though all the patients in this study were able to return to sports activity after the surgery, the postoperative level of sports activity was significantly lower than their preoperative level.

Methods: Between January 2009 and February 2017 prospectively collected data from competitive athletes within the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA), and who subsequently underwent arthroscopic treatment for symptomatic FAI, were analysed. Data was collected using internationally validated health questionnaires (Harris Hip Score, UCLA, SF-36, WOMAC) and recognised clinical (ROM, symptom presentation, provocation tests) and radiological (AP pelvis, Dunn, False profile) indicators/measures of FAI. Results: A total of 1021 consecutive cases (mean 26.6 ± 6.2 years) were included. In every case, conservative treatment failed to resolve symptoms with athletes attending an average of 2.4 ± 1.1 health care professionals prior to referral. Symptoms developed gradually (78%) and consisted primarily of groin pain (76.1%) and hip stiffness (76.5%) following activity. An acetabular rim deformity (pincer) was present in all cases; a cam deformity in 72.1%. The prevalence and degree of cam deformity increased with progressing age groups (p < 0.001); mean lateral centre-edge angle remained static (p = 0.456). Increasing CEA, alpha angle and presence of rim fracture was associated with a reduction in all ranges of hip movement (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Symptomatic SRFAI presented in this large series of GAA athletes failed to resolve with non-operative treatment. Increasing hip deformity resulted in poorer ROM. Abnormal acetabular morphology remains static with increasing athletic age while cam deformity is progressive and most likely a secondary pathology.","2019","2020-05-20 00:10:56","2020-05-20 00:10:56","","665-673","","6","29","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1120700018825430; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L626423854","adult; female; human; male; article; football; rugby; soccer; major clinical study; training; adolescent; athlete; treatment failure; prevalence; abduction; adduction; arthroscopy; physical examination; femoroacetabular impingement; sporting event; hip pain; inguinal pain; acetabulum fracture; clinical trial; conservative treatment; disease duration; dysplasia; Harris hip score; hip malformation; joint function; joint stiffness; morphology; musculoskeletal disease assessment; pathogenesis; patient-reported outcome; preoperative period; provocation test; Short Form 36; UCLA Activity Scale; Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, surgical methods for such patients are controversial. At our institution, we have consistently performed closed-wedge osteotomy of the distal humerus to treat advanced-stage OCD of the capitellum, regardless of the OCD grade or condition of the capitellar physis. Purpose: To clarify the clinical and radiological results and determine the influence of the capitellar physis on closed-wedge osteotomy for advanced-stage OCD of the capitellum in young patients. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: A total of 32 patients with OCD of the humeral capitellum were treated surgically with closed-wedge osteotomy. Of these, 17 patients with more than 2-year follow-up were available for an evaluation. The mean patient age was 11.8 years (range, 11-12 years), and the mean follow-up period was 70.1 months (range, 25-184 months). The clinical assessment included range of motion, elbow pain, and the Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) and Timmerman-Andrews scores. The radiological assessment at the final examination included cross-bridging of the physis, size and fishtail deformity of the distal part of the humerus, size of the radial head, healing of the OCD lesion, and osteoarthritis. Results: The mean range of motion and JOA and Timmerman-Andrews scores improved significantly after surgery; 13 patients were completely pain free. In 11 patients with an open capitellar physis, metaphyseal-epiphyseal, cross-bridging was observed in 1 patient. A fishtail deformity of the distal part of the humerus was not observed. Healing of the OCD lesion was defined as excellent in 9 patients, good in 3, fair in 3, and poor in 2. In 3 of the 5 patients in whom healing was described as fair or poor, there was a lesion of the lateral widespread type with osteoarthritis before surgery. Moderate osteoarthritic changes were evident in 2 patients. Conclusion: Closed-wedge osteotomy for the treatment of advanced-stage OCD of the capitellum in young patients can provide satisfactory clinical and radiological results. However, fair and poor outcomes were found in lateral widespread–type cases with osteoarthritis before surgery. We believe that patients in whom osteoarthritic changes have not yet appeared are eligible for closed-wedge osteotomy.","2019","2020-05-20 00:10:57","2020-05-20 00:10:57","","","","10","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2325967119876247; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2003485556","human; male; article; soccer; sport injury; clinical article; follow up; child; school child; range of motion; clinical assessment; baseball; softball; arm pain; closed wedge osteotomy; distal humerus; elbow; elbow radiography; epiphysis; Japanese Orthopaedic Association score; metaphysis; osteoarthritis; osteochondritis dissecans; osteotomy; radial head; wound healing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Extracting a peak value within a time series of relevance to ACL injuries is challenging due to differences in the relative timing and size of the peak value of interest. Aims/hypotheses: The aim was to cluster analyze the knee valgus moment time series curve shape in the early stance phase. We hypothesized that 1a) There would be few discrete curve shapes, 1b) there would be a shape reflecting an early peak of the knee valgus moment, 2a) youth athletes of both sexes would show similar frequencies of early peaks, 2b) adolescent girls would have greater early peak frequencies. Methods: N = 213 (39% boys) youth soccer and team handball athletes (phase 1) and N = 35 (45% boys) with 5 year follow-up data (phase 2) were recorded performing a change of direction task with 3D motion analysis and a force plate. The time series of the first 30% of stance phase were cluster analyzed based on Euclidean distances in two steps; shape-based main clusters with a transformed time series, and magnitude based sub-clusters with body weight normalized time series. Group differences (sex, phase) in curve shape frequencies, and shape-magnitude frequencies were tested with chi-squared tests. Results: Six discrete shape-clusters and 14 magnitude based sub-clusters were formed. Phase 1 boys had greater frequency of early peaks than phase 1 girls (38% vs 25% respectively, P < 0.001 for full test). Phase 2 girls had greater frequency of early peaks than phase 2 boys (42% vs 21% respectively, P < 0.001 for full test). Conclusions: Cluster analysis can reveal different patterns of curve shapes in biomechanical data, which likely reflect different movement strategies. The early peak shape is relatable to the ACL injury mechanism as the timing of its peak moment is consistent with the timing of injury. Greater frequency of early peaks demonstrated by Phase 2 girls is consistent with their higher risk of ACL injury in sports.","2019","2020-05-20 00:10:59","2020-05-20 00:10:59","","","","1","6","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002430582; http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40634-019-0205-5","female; human; male; article; biomechanics; controlled study; major clinical study; prospective study; adolescent; athlete; cohort analysis; follow up; sex difference; body weight; child; school child; body height; cluster analysis; anterior cruciate ligament injury; risk factor; kinematics; disease predisposition; femoral condyle; greater trochanter; hip muscle; iliac crest; laboratory test; movement (physiology); standing; time series analysis; valgus knee","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For the quantitative game analysis and assessment of team styles, we need a general framework that can characterize such formation structures dynamically. This paper develops a clustering algorithm for formations of multiple football (soccer) games based on the Delaunay method, which defines the formation of a team as an adjacency matrix of Delaunay triangulation. We first show that heat maps of entire football games can be clustered into several average formations: ""442"", ""4141"", ""433"", ""541"", and ""343"". Then, using hierarchical clustering, each average formation is further divided into more specific patterns (clusters) in which the configurations of players are different. Our method enables the visualization, quantitative comparison, and time-series analysis for formations in different time scales by focusing on transitions between clusters at each hierarchy. In particular, we can extract team styles from multiple games regarding the positional exchange of players within the formations. Applying our algorithm to the datasets comprising football games, we extract typical transition patterns of the formation for a particular team.","2019","2020-05-20 00:11:00","2020-05-20 00:11:00","","13172","","1","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629304306; http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-48623-1","human; article; football; soccer; heat; quantitative analysis; time series analysis; algorithm; hierarchical clustering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A suspected epsilon wave was seen in lead V1. The patient denied any history of chest pain, palpitations, dizziness, or unexplained syncope. He had no medical history, was not taking any regular medications, and had no known family history of sudden cardiac death. Clinical examination was unremarkable. Chest x-ray was normal, as were routine blood investigations. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed an abnormal right ventricle (RV) with a hypodynamic and dilated tip. The RV formed the cardiac apex and wrapped around a spherically shaped left ventricle (LV). Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) confirmed spherical remodelling of the LV (sphericity index of 0.95). The LV had normal cavity size, my-ocardial mass, and systolic function. A prominent fat pad was present at the LV apex and partially infiltrated the thinned apical myocardium (seen on STIR fat-suppressed images). The RV had normal size and global systolic function. The RV apex was dilated and hypokinetic, and extended anteriorly over the LV apex, such that the RV constituted the cardiac apex. RV end-diastolic volume to body surface area ratio was 100mL/m2. Late enhancement post-gadolinium showed high signal localised to the LV cardiac apex at the site of the epicardial apical fat collection. No episodes of ventricular tachycardia or any other significant arrhythmias were present on 7-day ambulatory ECG monitoring. Exercise-stress testing was normal. Patient remained well and underwent elective surgery with no complications. Repeat CMR one year later showed no changes, with preserved ejection fraction and cavity size of both ventricles. Patient is on an annual surveillance programme with CMR assessment and ECG monitoring. Although he is currently still participating in competitive sports, cessation will be advised if any increments in RV size occur. Discussion: Although ECG and TTE findings were suspicious of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), not enough Revised Task Force criteria (2010) were satisfied to confirm this diagnosis. Isolated left ventricular apical hypoplasia was thus considered as the underlying aetiology. This is a rare congenital anomaly with characteristic CMR features that has only been recently described in litera-ture.The phenotypic CMR findings are (1) an impaired, spherical LV with a truncated apex, (2) replacement of the LV apical myocardium with fatty material, (3) anteroapical origin of the LV papillary muscle, and (4) an elongated RV wrapped around the LV apex.","2019","2020-05-20 00:11:01","2020-05-20 00:11:01","","ii164","","","20","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ehjci/jez107.001; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L630691153","adult; conference abstract; human; male; rugby; Caucasian; case report; clinical article; exercise; young adult; preoperative evaluation; body weight; clinical examination; sudden cardiac death; transthoracic echocardiography; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; heart right ventricle dysplasia; thorax radiography; complication; dizziness; body surface; stress; family history; fat pad; congenital malformation; elective surgery; electrocardiography monitoring; faintness; gadolinium; heart ejection fraction; heart palpitation; heart right bundle branch block; heart right ventricle enddiastolic volume; heart ventricle tachycardia; hypoplasia; incidental finding; left ventricular apex; left ventricular papillary muscle; orthopedic surgery; QRS complex; thorax pain","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of this study was to examine and compare the internal training load and session rating of perceived exertion between coaches' and young soccer players' during three weeks in different training phases. Method: Participants were 16 male elite Under19 soccer players and their coaches. Before each training session, the coaches reported a session rating of perceived exertion using the Borg CR-10 scale as well as the planned duration (min) of the training based on prior planning, while the athletes responded the scale after each training session. Results: No differences in intensity session rating of perceived exertion (t = 0.49; p = 0.62) and training load (t = 0.18; p = 0.86) were observed between coaches and players during the training period analyzed. During different training phases, no significant differences were found during intensification (t = 0.18; p = 0.85) and taper (t = -0.19; p = 0.85) in training loads and in the session rating of perceived exertion prescribed by coaches and perceived by players. A very large correlation was observed between coaches training load (r= 0.84) and players training load. However, a trivial correlation was found between players training load and changes in the Yo-yo IR1 performance (r= -0.09), age (r= -0.06) and years of competitive experience (r= -0.08). Stepwise linear regression revealed that coaches training load (F1; 238= 582.7; R2= 0.710; p<0.001) explained 71% of the variance in players training load. Conclusion: The results suggest that the session rating of perceived exertion and training load prescribed during three weeks in different training phases (by coaches) was not different from perceived by young soccer players. Moreover, coaches training load seem to be effective to predict the training load in soccer players.

Antes de cada sesión de entrenamiento, los entrenadores informaron una clasificación del esfuerzo de sesión percibido usando la escala Borg CR-10 así como la duración planificada (min) de la capacitación basada en la planificación previa, mientras que los atletas respondieron la escala después de cada sesión de entrenamiento. Resultados: No se observaron diferencias en la percepción subjetiva del esfuerzo durante el entrenamiento (t = 0.49; p = 0.62) y la carga de entrenamiento (t = 0.18; p = 0.86) entre el entrenador y los jugadores durante el período de entrenamiento analizado. Durante las diferentes fases de entrenamiento no se encontraron diferencias significativas durante la intensificación (t = 0.18; p = 0.85) ni la reducción de cargas (t = -0.19; p = 0.85), en las cargas de entrenamiento y en la percepción subjetiva del esfuerzo, durante el entrenamiento prescrito por el entrenador y percibido por los julgadores. Se observaron correlaciones muy grandes entre la carga de entrenamiento de los entrenadores (r = 0.84) y la carga de entrenamiento de los jugadores. Sin embargo, se encontró una correlación trivial entre la carga de entrenamiento de los jugadores y los cambios en el rendimiento del Yo-yo IR1 (r = -0.09), edad (r = -0.06) y años de experiencia competitiva (r = -0.08). La regresión lineal múltiple reveló que la carga de entrenamiento de los entrenadores (F1; 238 = 582.7, R2 = 0.710, p <0.001) explicó el 71% de la varianza en la carga de entrenamiento de los jugadores.Los resultados sugieren que la percepcion subjetiva del esfuerzo durante el entrenamiento prescrito durante tres semanas, en diferentesfases de entrenamiento, no fue diferente de lo percibido por los jugadores jovenes de futbol. Ademas, la carga de entrenamiento de los entrenadores parece ser eficaz para predecir la carga de entrenamiento en estos jugadores.

Given the increased participation rates, burgeoning talent identification (TID) programs and the reportedly high injury-risk associated with competitive youth rugby, the minimal qualities or skills needed for effective performance by all young players need further clarification. Therefore, this qualitative study was conducted to explore the perceptions of high-school based rugby coaches on the key qualities or skills defining good adolescent rugby players and should be considered for player recruitment in TID programs. Currently, there is no consensus in literature from the coaches' perspective on these qualities. RESULTS: The final sample had 22 coaches (median age = 45.5 years) with years of coaching high-school rugby ranging from 6 to 17 years. Using the conventional approach to inductive content analysis four broad themes emerged suggesting the multifaceted nature of the requirements imperative for effective and optimal rugby performance among adolescent rugby players as perceived by the coaches. Themes identified included: physiological characteristics, anthropometric attributes, psychological qualities and game-specific skills. Possibly, training approaches or design of rugby-specific test-batteries should consider all these important qualities and be multi-dimensional in composition.","2019","2020-05-20 00:11:06","2020-05-20 00:11:06","","132","","1","12","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L626778026; http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13104-019-4170-y","adult; human; male; adolescent; athlete; physiology; psychology; motor performance; aptitude; athletic performance; teacher; middle aged; qualitative research; mentoring; school; body constitution; Zimbabwe","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Antioxidants such as cocoa flavanols have been used as a supplement to prevent oxidative stress; however, the benefits of dietary antioxidants for athletic performance after muscle soreness (MS) is unclear. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of cocoa flavanols after a MS inducing protocol. Methods: In a randomized, double-blinded design, 13 male collegiate rugby players consumed either chocolate milk (CHOC) or chocolate milk with additional cocoa flavanols (CocoaCHOC) during a 7-d loading phase. MS was induced by a drop jump protocol on day 5 of the intervention. Athlete performance was assessed with vertical-jump and yo-yo tests and subjective measures of soreness 5 d before and 2 d post-MS protocol. Urinary markers of oxidative stress (isoprostanes) were assessed before and 48 h post-MS. Results: No changes were observed between the groups over time for isometric torque (P =.63), vertical jump performance (P =.39), and yo-yo testing (P =.57) between the trials. No interaction was found in isoprostanes levels between the trials (CocoaCHOC baseline: 88 ± 0.38 pg/mL and 48 h post-MS: 81 ± 0.53 pg/mL; P =.82; and CHOC baseline: 98 ± 0.96 pg/mL and 48 h post-MS: 96 ± 0.38 pg/mL; P =.59). No main effect (treatment × time; P =.58) was observed for isoprostanes. Although not significant, the CocoaCHOC group ran 97 meters further than the CHOC group in the yo-yo test. Conclusions: Cocoa flavanols added to a post-exercise recovery beverage for 7 d has no oxidative stress or athletic performance benefits.","2019","2020-05-20 00:11:07","2020-05-20 00:11:07","","47-51","","","62","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2018.10.035; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2001636069","adult; human; human experiment; male; article; rugby; sport injury; priority journal; controlled study; athlete; young adult; randomized controlled trial; muscle function; exercise test; athletic performance; creatine kinase; double blind procedure; muscle injury; oxidative stress; biological marker; exercise recovery; torque; myalgia; chocolate milk; cocoa beverage; flavanol derivative; isometrics; isoprostane derivative; muscle examination; therapy effect; urine sampling; vertical jump test; yo yo test","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For this, 84 soccer players aged 13 to 19 (16.04 ± 1.73), all males and players from 3 clubs of the State of São Paulo, participated voluntarily. It's important to highlight that all participants completed the Term of Free and Informed Consent (TCLE) and the consent term, in the case of minors. All participants answered the Group Environment Questionnaire - QEG, adapted and validated to Portuguese language, in addition they fulfill a sociodemographic questionnaire. Descriptive and inferential analyzes were used. The results show that, for intragroup analysis, independently of the club, there are higher scores for individual attraction dimension in the task group, followed by individual attraction in the social group and lower scores for integration dimension in the task group. Regarding the analysis between clubs, it can be observed that club 3 presented higher scores than club 2, only, for the individual attraction dimensions in the task group and integration in the task group. We concluded that grassroots athletes seem to prioritize the dimensions of individual attraction, which may be involved with the desire to become professional and the uncertainty of whether this goal will be achieved. In addition, club 3 athletes were more cohesive than club 2 athletes, indicating that they may have a greater concern with psychological preparation, coupled with a preferred leadership style by athletes.

PERTINENT MEDICAL HISTORY A 20 year old, 228 pounds, 6 foot 2 inch, African American male, defensive lineman reported to the athletic training facility on August 12th, 2018 with a chief complaint of hematuria. When questioned by the athletic training staff, the athlete did not recall any direct blows or any other known mechanism of acute trauma to his flank/trunk region. This line of questioning was used to discover a possible mechanism in the events leading up to the hematuria. No other signs or symptoms related or unrelated to the hematuria were discovered upon initial patient exam. There was no relevant family medical history reported that would assist in an immediate differential diagnosis related to the reported hematuria. It was noted that the father's medial history is unknown. He denied taking supplements, such as creatine, but did report he had been self-medicating with ibuprofen daily but did not specify the amount. INITIAL TREATMENT AND MANAGEMENT Due to the athlete's reported symptoms and limited knowledge of any possible traumatic mechanism, the athletic trainer who completed the evaluation deemed it necessary to refer him to the emergency department (ED). He was sent immediately to the ED for further evaluation and he was admitted on August 12th for initial chief complaint of hematuria. After various diagnostic labs were conducted, the athlete was initially diagnosed with an acute kidney injury. Blood results indicated high levels of creatine kinase (CK) resulting in the secondary diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis. A computed tomography (CT) scan showed evidence of a dilated right ureter. No kidney stones were identified. The athlete was discharged on August 15th and was instructed to maintain adequate hydration and decrease physical activity. Due to his CK levels remaining abnormally high from original readings, the urologist ordered further investigational procedures to evaluate for post urethral valves. The athlete was referred to the nephrologist on August 30th for specialist review prior to medical clearance. On September 4th, the athlete was cleared to start cardiovascular fitness. On September 14th, after approximately ten days of gradual activity, the athlete was removed from participation due to high levels of CK. On September 20th, the nephrologist concluded the athlete's CK levels fluctuated between 1.4-1.5 mg/dL since August 15th. Normative values range from 0.7-1.3mg/dL.1 The athlete was said to have true hematuria with many red blood cells found in the urinalysis, which is less consistent with pigment injury related to muscle break down in a more common case of rhabdomyolysis. The urologist described the athlete as having ureterocele on the right side, which could possibly be related to the hematuria. The athlete was cleared for full return to sport on February 12th, 2019 by the nephrologist and team physician. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS Myopathy, heat related illness, acute renal failure, cancer, sickle cell anemia. TREATMENT AND MANAGEMENT Preserving renal function and stunting skeletal muscle damage are the priorities in the treatment of rhabdomyolysis. Intravenous (IV) hydration must be initiated as early as possible. Initially, normal saline should be administered at a rate of 1-2 L per hour. Urine output is then to be monitored and maintained at 200 mL per hour until myoglobinuria (myoglobin in the urine) has ceased. Once the oliguria has been prevented, an addition of one or two ampules of sodium bicarbonate and 10 g per L of mannitol to a .45 percent saline solution can be started. The objective of the treatment is to increase hydration status and increase alkalinity of the urine to a pH of greater than 6.5 to decrease the toxicity of myoglobin to the tubules. If CK levels continue to elevate 48 to 72 post injury, the consultation of a nephrologist or surgeon should be considered, depending on the severity of kidney disease or presence of compartment syndrome. NIQUENESS Related literature has shown that the incidence of rhabdomyolysis to be 29.9 per 100,000 patients per year.2 Fewer than 200,000 reported cases of rhabdomyolysis per year in the US. About 1 in 500 to 1000 people are born with uretoceles.4 The athlete presented with no signs of heat illness prior to chief complaint of hematuria. Furthermore, it is unknown if the identified uretocele exacerbated the rhabdomyolysis. CONCLUSION Early diagnosis and treatment of rhabdomyolysis is crucial in preventing muscle ischemia, cardiac arrhythmia, and death of the athlete. While the NATA and NCAA have addressed important recognition, treatment and management strategies of rhabdomyolysis, there is no current method of best-practice of return-to-play guidelines for an athlete that has been diagnosed with rhabdomyolysis.5 The NATA has published a step-wise process to help return an athlete to participation. The Consortium for Health and Military Performance (CHAMP) guidelines for return to sport following exertional rhabdomyolysis could also be utilized by athletic trainers returning athletes to activity.6 Understanding risk factors and predispositions associated to rhabdomyolysis is essential in providing optimal care. Following the diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis, the athletic trainer plays a key role in monitoring the athlete in a return to play progression.

These transitions raise questions about the million-dollar salaries prevalent in college sports. Current events like this tend to dominate classroom conversations. Navigating these issues and their relation to class content can be challenging. Although the amount of money spent on coaches is not surprising, any discussion to provide new strategies may not be legally viable. For example, when students propose ideas about limiting coaching salaries, they may not realize the legal implication of that action. This case study uses the legal case-study model to address questions related to intercollegiate athletic coaching salaries and the possibility of a salary cap. Providing legal application in other courses will address these questions for both students and for faculty members who might not have the legal background to answer these questions.

How and why do athletes make these reporting decisions? Using original survey data from a cohort of college football players, we evaluate two assumptions of the current literature on injury reporting: first, that the probability of reporting a concussion or injury is constant over time; second, that athletes make reasoned deliberative decisions about whether to report their concussion or other injury. We find that athletes are much less likely to report a concussion to a medical professional than they are to report another injury (47% vs. 80%), but no association between reporting and a measure of athletes' ability to switch from fast, reactive thinking to reasoned, deliberative thinking. The likelihood of reporting decreases as the number of injuries and concussions increases, and no athlete reported more than four concussions. Sports medicine clinicians sometimes use four concussions as a time to discuss possibly curtailing sports participation, which may influence athletes' subsequent reporting behavior. Sports medicine clinicians may want to consider athlete injury history as a risk factor for concussion and injury under-reporting.","2019","2020-05-20 00:11:13","2020-05-20 00:11:13","","2065-2072","","13","36","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2018.6161; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628358535","sports medicine; football player; human; male; article; sport injury; concussion; cognition; questionnaire; risk factor; attitude to health; self report; cognitive function test; cognitive reflection; college student; high risk behavior; high risk population; interpersonal communication; validation process","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thirty-one young (14.5 ± 0.52 years; tanner stage 3–4) soccer players were randomly assigned to either a combined-(COMB, n = 14), plyometric-training (PLYO, n = 9) or an active control group (CONT, n = 8). Two training sessions were added to the regular soccer training consisting of one session of light-load high-velocity resistance exercises combined with one session of plyometric/sprint training (COMB), two sessions of plyometric/sprint training (PLYO) or two soccer training sessions (CONT). Training volume was similar between the experimental groups. Before and after 7-weeks of training, peak torque, as well as absolute and relative (normalized to torque; RTDr ) rate of torque development (RTD) during maximal voluntary isometric contraction of the knee extensors (KE) were monitored at time intervals from the onset of contraction to 200 ms. Jump height, sprinting speed at 5, 10, 20-m and change-of-direction ability performances were also assessed. There were no significant between–group baseline differences. Both COMB and PLYO significantly increased their jump height (Δ14.3%; ES = 0.94; Δ 12.1%; ES = 0.54, respectively) and RTD at mid to late phases but with greater within effect sizes in COMB in comparison with PLYO. However, significant increases in peak torque (Δ 16.9%; p < 0.001; ES = 0.58), RTD (44.3%; ES = 0.71), RTDr (Δ 27.3%; ES = 0.62) and sprint performance at 5-m (Δ -4.7%; p < 0.001; ES = 0.73) were found in COMB without any significant pre-to-post change in PLYO and CONT groups.

We introduce the novel concept of fiber-flux density for modeling fiber tracts’ geometry, and combine it with diffusion-based measures to define vector descriptors called Fiber-Flux Diffusion Density (FFDD). The proposed model captures informative features of WM tracts at both the microscopic (diffusion-related) and macroscopic (geometry-related) scales, thus enabling improved sensitivity to subtle structural abnormalities that are not reflected by either diffusion or geometrical properties alone. A key step in this framework is the construction of an FFDD dissimilarity measure for sub-voxel alignment of fiber bundles, based on the fast marching method (FMM). The obtained aligned WM tracts enable meaningful inter-subject comparisons and group-wise statistical analysis. Moreover, we show that the FMM alignment can be generalized in a straight forward manner to a single-shot co-alignment of multiple fiber bundles. The proposed alignment technique is shown to outperform a well-established, commonly used DTI registration algorithm. We demonstrate the FFDD framework on the Human Connectome Project (HCP) diffusion MRI dataset, as well as on two different datasets of contact sports players. We test our method using longitudinal scans of a basketball player diagnosed with a traumatic brain injury, showing compatibility with structural MRI findings.

These characteristics may vary according to the field position, in order to improve athletic performance and efficiency. However, there is a lack of studies that verified differences on strength, muscle power, agility and flexibility among field positions in children and adolescents soccer players. The aim of the present study is to compare muscle strength, muscle power, agility and flexibility performance among field positions of male soccer players aged between 10 and 15 years old. Thirty-nine male individuals recruited from a soccer school, with mean age of 13.1 ± 1.94 years, practice time of 5.9 ± 2.6 years, were assigned according to field positions. Single Hop Test, Shuttle Run, Sit and Reach and isometric dynamometer for lower limb strength assessment were performed. The results of the all tests comparisons showed no significant difference among field positions (p > 0.05). Soccer players aged between 10 and 15 years old showed no difference on strength, muscle power, agility and flexibility performance among soccer field positions.

The distance initial the test was of 15 meters, with progressives increases in 1 meters every series, the highest velocity reached in the test (km.h- 1) was determined as maximum yield of aerobic power (PVT-CAR). The results demostred that variables age, stature, body mass and PVT-CAR differentiate between categories, and maturational stages (pre-pubertal and pubertal, compared with post-pubertal) (P<0.05), how much the body fat, there was no differences between categories and levels maturational, as HRMÁX-TCAR (P>0.05). In conclusion, the chronological age and maturational stages exert important function on anthropometric variables and aerobic power. Finally, the PVT-CAR presents itself as an useful tool for classifying a group, since mature athletes support higher training loads.

The sample consisted of 20 athletes (13 ± 1.2 years) who were initially submitted to anthropometric evaluation: height, body mass and percentage of fat, maximum stress test in the treadmill. Subsequently, the training sessions were analyzed in different formats of reduced games (2x2 and 3x3). Heart rate and subjective perception of exertion were monitored in all sessions. The mean heart rate in both the treadmill test (190.2 ± 9.8) and the 2x2 and 3x3 games (190.8 ± 12.9 and 184.2 ± 16.6) were very similar. Meanwhile, the perception of the effort reported in the treadmill test (9.5 ± 0.7) was superior to the 2x2 and 3x3 games performed in the training (7.0 ± 1.2 and 6.5 ± 1.4), respectively. It was concluded that the internal loading intensities found in the training exercises were similar and even superior to the maximum treadmill test. Already the perception of effort compared to the exercises showed lower values than those found in the treadmill test.

In total, 2,303 corner kicks were examined by univariate analyses (individual χ2) and bivariate analyses with contingency tables (χ2 and association measures). Top six teams favoured an outswinging delivery, whilst the bottom six teams favoured inswinging deliveries (p < 0.001). Top six teams operated a dynamic attacking organisation during ball deliveries (p < 0.001), whereas the bottom six operated static and dynamic attacking strategies in equal measure. Top six teams took corner kicks frequently when winning or drawing, whereas bottom six teams took most corner kicks when losing or drawing (match status, p < 0.001). Bivariate analyses identified that goals were scored from corner kicks when attacking organisation was dynamic, two defenders were on the posts and the score line was level (p < 0.05). Results supplement the design of practice tasks that afford successful corner kicks in training and game play scenarios.

Twenty young soccer players (18.6 ± 0.6) were randomly assigned to either GPBT or SSG protocols performed twice a week for 8 weeks. The GPBT consisted of 2 sets of 6-10 minutes of intermittent soccer-specific circuits. The SSG training consisted of 3-5 sets of 5 vs. 5 SSGs played on a 42 × 30-m pitch. Before and after the training program, the following physical performances were assessed: repeated sprint ability, change of direction (COD), linear sprinting on 10 m and 20 m, countermovement jump, and intermittent running (YYIRL1). Significant improvements were found in all the assessed variables after both training interventions (p < 0.05). The GPBT group improved more than the SSG group in the 10-m and 20-m sprint tests by 2.4% (g = 0.4; small effect) and 4% (g = 0.9; large effect), respectively. Conversely, the SSG group jumped 4% higher (g = 0.4; small effect) and resulted 6.7% quicker than the GPBT (g = 1.5; large effect) in completing the COD task. These results suggest both GPBT and SSGs to be effective for fitness development among elite young soccer players during the competitive season. More importantly, these 2 conditioning methodologies may be considered in terms of specificity for selectively improving or maintaining specific soccer fitness-related performances in the latter phase of the season.","2019","2020-05-20 00:11:30","2020-05-20 00:11:30","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1519/JSC.0000000000003225; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628142474","human; article; soccer player; controlled study; season; physical performance; training; running; juvenile; randomized controlled trial; pitch","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Seventy-one male athletes were enrolled in this study, divided into three groups: twenty-five soccer players, fourteen volleyball players and thirty-two healthy sedentary subjects. All subjects were assessed for anthropometric measures required for the calculation of body composition variables, using standardized procedures recommended by previous studies. Data was analysed using SPSS and the descriptive statistics were expressed as a mean (SD) for each variable, while the ANOVA and the LSD Post Hoc tests were carried out to detect eff ects of each type of sport. The results showed that a significant diff erence was found in variables height, weight, and body fat, but no significant diff erence was found in the remaining three variables, body mass index, muscle mass or bone content. Volleyball players were significantly taller and heavier than soccer players or subjects from the control group, while there was no significant diff erence between height and weight of soccer players and subjects from the control group. Subjects from the control group had signifi- cantly higher percentage of body fat than both soccer and volleyball players. Soccer players had the lowest percentage of body fat, while subjects from the control group had the highest values of the same variable. Therefore, these findings may give coaches from the region better working knowledge and suggest to them to follow recent selection process methods and to be more careful during the process of talent identification.

In the Australian Football League, both subjective and objective evaluations of player match performance are commonplace. This study aimed to identify the extent to which performance indicators can explain subjective ratings of player performance. A secondary aim was to compare subjective and objective ratings of player performance. Inside Football Player Ratings (IFPR) and Australian Football League Player Ratings were collected as subjective and objective evaluations of player performance, respectively, for each player during all 1026 matches throughout the 2013-2017 Australian Football League seasons. Nine common player performance indicators, player role classification, player age and match outcomes were also collected. Standardised linear mixed model and recursive partitioning and regression tree models were undertaken across the whole dataset, as well as separately for each of the seven player roles. The mixed model analysis produced a model associating the performance indicators with IFPR at a root mean square error of 0.98. Random effects accounting for differences between seasons and players ranged by 0.09 and 1.73 IFPR each across the five seasons and 1052 players, respectively. The recursive partitioning and regression tree model explained IFPR exactly in 35.8% of instances, and to within 1.0 IFPR point in 81.0% of instances. When analysed separately by player role, exact explanation varied from 25.2% to 41.7%, and within 1.0 IFPR point from 70.3% to 88.6%. Overall, kicks and handballs were most associated with the IFPR. This study highlights that a select few features account for a majority of the variance when explaining subjective ratings of player performance, and that these vary by player role. Australian Football League organisations should utilise both subjective and objective assessments of performance to gain a better understanding of the differences associated with subjective performance assessment.","2019","2020-05-20 00:11:36","2020-05-20 00:11:36","","","","8","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0220901; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002596375","football player; human; article; season; organization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Objective: To compare the effectiveness of BFR-RT and standard-care traditional heavy-load resistance training (HL-RT) at improving skeletal muscle hypertrophy and strength, physical function, pain and effusion in ACLR patients following surgery. Methods: 28 patients scheduled for unilateral ACLR surgery with hamstring autograft were recruited for this parallel-group, two-arm, single-assessor blinded, randomised clinical trial following appropriate power analysis. Following surgery, a criteria-driven approach to rehabilitation was utilised and participants were block randomised to either HL-RT at 70% repetition maximum (1RM) (n = 14) or BFR-RT (n = 14) at 30% 1RM. Participants completed 8 weeks of biweekly unilateral leg press training on both limbs, totalling 16 sessions, alongside standard hospital rehabilitation. Resistance exercise protocols were designed consistent with standard recommended protocols for each type of exercise. Scaled maximal isotonic strength (10RM), muscle morphology of the vastus lateralis of the injured limb, self-reported function, Y-balance test performance and knee joint pain, effusion and range of motion (ROM) were assessed at pre-surgery, post-surgery, mid-training and post-training. Knee joint laxity and scaled maximal isokinetic knee extension and flexion strength at 60°/s, 150°/s and 300°/s were measured at pre-surgery and post-training. Results: Four participants were lost, with 24 participants completing the study (12 per group). There were no adverse events or differences between groups for any baseline anthropometric variable or pre- to post-surgery change in any outcome measure. Scaled 10RM strength significantly increased in the injured limb (104 ± 30% and 106 ± 43%) and non-injured limb (33 ± 13% and 39 ± 17%) with BFR-RT and HL-RT, respectively, with no group differences. Significant increases in knee extension and flexion peak torque were observed at all speeds in the non-injured limb with no group differences. Significantly greater attenuation of knee extensor peak torque loss at 150°/s and 300°/s and knee flexor torque loss at all speeds was observed with BFR-RT. No group differences in knee extensor peak torque loss were found at 60°/s. Significant and comparable increases in muscle thickness (5.8 ± 0.2% and 6.7 ± 0.3%) and pennation angle (4.1 ± 0.3% and 3.4 ± 0.1%) were observed with BFR-RT and HL-RT, respectively, with no group differences. No significant changes in fascicle length were observed. Significantly greater and clinically important increases in several measures of self-reported function (50–218 ± 48% vs. 35–152 ± 56%), Y-balance performance (18–59 ± 22% vs. 18–33 ± 19%), ROM (78 ± 22% vs. 48 ± 13%) and reductions in knee joint pain (67 ± 15% vs. 39 ± 12%) and effusion (6 ± 2% vs. 2 ± 2%) were observed with BFR-RT compared to HL-RT, respectively. Conclusion: BFR-RT can improve skeletal muscle hypertrophy and strength to a similar extent to HL-RT with a greater reduction in knee joint pain and effusion, leading to greater overall improvements in physical function. Therefore, BFR-RT may be more appropriate for early rehabilitation in ACLR patient populations within the National Health Service.

We analyzed 18 teams composed of three players, they were 13.92 ± 1.17 years old and with 5.65 ± 2.65 years of time practice. These players performed 4,716 tactical actions evaluated by System of Tactical Assessment in Soccer (FUT-SAT). Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation and percentage difference), Shapiro–Wilk test, independent t-test, Mann–Whitney test, paired t-test, and Cohen's kappa test were used. The results indicated that the champions' teams accomplished more offensive tactical actions (quantitatively) and were more efficient (qualitatively) in these actions than the other teams. In addition, the champions' teams were more effectiveness (action outcomes) in offensive and defensive movements. Otherwise, the runner-up and third-placed performed more (quantitatively) defensive tactical actions and were more efficient (qualitatively) in these actions. It is concluded that the champions' teams had more initiative in the matches due to the greater quantity and quality of their offensive tactical actions and more effectiveness in the offensive and defensive actions, while their opponents were reactive.

METHODS: 23 professional and semi-professional ARF players, performed six CMJs and three, eight-second 50-meter runs every 30 s (SRT), seven days apart. Absolute and trial-to-trial reliability was represented as a coefficient of variation (CV) ± 90% confidence intervals (CI). Test-retest reliability was examined using the magnitude of the difference (effect size (ES) ± 90% CI) from week 1 to week 2. The smallest worthwhile change (SWC) was calculated as 0.25 x SD. RESULTS: Good reliability (CVs = 6.6 - 9.3%) was determined for all variables except eccentric displacement (CV = 12.8%), with no clear changes observed in any variables between week 1 and week 2. All variables from the SRT possessed a CV < SWC, indicating an ability to detect practically important changes in performance. Only peak velocity from the CMJ test possessed a CV < SWC, exhibiting a limitation of this test in detecting practically meaningful changes within this environment. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that while all variables possess acceptable reliability, a SRT might offer to be a more sensitive monitoring tool than a CMJ test within high-performance ARF, due to its greater ability for detecting practically important changes in performance.","2019","2020-05-20 00:11:42","2020-05-20 00:11:42","","1-17","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1123/ijspp.2019-0150; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L627621175","football player; human; article; monitoring; effect size; quantitative analysis; test retest reliability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Participants were twenty-six male professional soccer players (age: 21.65 ± 2.03 years; height: 180.00 ± 7.47 cm; weight: 73.81 ± 5.65 kg) from FC Barcelona B, of whom were recorded a total of 759 measurements during 38 official matches in the Spanish second division. The Mediacoach System and the Wimu Pro were compared using the standardized mean bias, standard error of estimate, intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), coefficient of variation (%), and the regression equation to estimate data for each variable. In terms of agreement between systems, the magnitude of the ICC was almost perfect (> 0.90–1.00) for all variables analyzed. The coefficient of the variations between devices was close to zero (< 5%) for total distance, distance per minute, average speed, maximum speed, and walking and jogging, and between 9% and 15% for running, intense running, and sprinting at low and at high intensities. It can be observed that, compared to Wimu Pro the Mediacoach System slightly overestimated all the variables analyzed except for average speed, maximum speed, and walking variables. In conclusion, both systems can be used, and the information they provide in the analyzed variables can be interchanged, with the benefits implied for practitioners and researchers.","2019","2020-05-20 00:11:44","2020-05-20 00:11:44","","","","8","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0220729; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002524929","adult; human; human experiment; male; article; soccer player; young adult; running; jogging; velocity; walking; height; physician; videorecording; scientist; correlation coefficient; intermethod comparison; eye tracking","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Comparison of countermovement jump-derived reactive strength index modified and underpinning force-time variables between super league and championship rugby league players. J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2019-The countermovement jump (CMJ) is regularly tested in rugby league (RL), with recent work reporting reactive strength index modified (RSImod) to distinguish between levels of play. Differences in CMJ-derived RSImod and underpinning force-time variables between English Super League (SL) and RL Championship (RLC) players are, however, unknown. As SL and RLC teams compete against each other, this study addressed this knowledge gap. Sixty RL players from the English SL (n = 30) and RLC (n = 30) performed 3 CMJs on a force platform at the start of the preseason training. The RSImod was calculated by dividing jump height (JH) by time to take-off (TTT), and several other variables were also extracted from the force-time record. The SL players achieved a significantly higher (large effect) RSImod by performing the CMJ with a significantly shorter (large effect) TTT but a similar (small effect) JH. The SL players achieved the shorter TTT through a significantly reduced (large effects) relative displacement during both the countermovement (combined unweighting and braking displacement) and propulsion phases but a significantly higher (moderate effects) propulsion peak force and power. The relationships between TTT and relative countermovement (r = 0.719, p < 0.001) and propulsion (r = 0.771, p < 0.001) displacement for combined group data were very large. Practitioners working in RL should, therefore, consider reporting RSImod and TTT, alongside JH, after CMJ force-time testing. We also suggest that RL players who produce lower RSImod scores would benefit from being trained to produce larger CMJ propulsion forces over a shallower range of hip, knee, and ankle extension.","2019","2020-05-20 00:11:46","2020-05-20 00:11:46","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1519/JSC.0000000000003380; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629824246","human; article; rugby; hip; knee; clinical article; ankle; physician","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Studies have documented emergency preparedness and medical coverage standards in the high school athletic setting. However, similar examinations do not exist for youth club sport teams. PURPOSE: To determine if differences in emergency preparedness and medical coverage exist between high school team coaches and high school-aged club team coaches. A secondary purpose was to compare emergency training characteristics between high school and club coaches. METHODS: A total of 769 coaches (female N=266, 34.6%, age: 41.0±11.5 years) completed an anonymous online questionnaire regarding their emergency preparedness and training. Coaches from 3 sports were surveyed (basketball N=290, volleyball N=256, soccer N=223). The questionnaire consisted of 1) demographics and information regarding the teams that the respondent coaches, 2) emergency preparedness factors such as automated external defibrillator (AED) availability, emergency action plan (EAP) awareness, and medical coverage, and 3) emergency care training requirements (CPR, AED, first aid). Chi-square tests were used to compare response frequencies to various emergency preparedness questions between high school and club coaches. RESULTS: Overall, 64.6% (N=497) respondents were coaches of a high school team, and 35.4% (N=272) were coaches of a club team with high school-aged athletes. High school coaches were more likely than club coaches to be aware of the EAP for their practice venue (83.9% vs. 54.4%, p<.001), but most coaches in both categories had not practiced their EAP in the past 12 months (70.0% vs. 68.9%, p=.54). During competitions, high school coaches were more likely than club coaches to be aware of the EAP (47.5% vs. 37.1%, p=.02). However, the majority of coaches in each category reported that they were never aware of EAPs during competition. High school coaches were more likely than club coaches to 1) have an AED available at practice (87.9% vs. 58.8%, p<.001), 2), to report that athletic trainers were responsible for medical care at practices (31.2% vs. 8.8%, p<.001) and competitions (57.9% vs. 31.2%, p<.001), and 3) to be required to have CPR, AED, or first aid training (p<.001). Nearly all (98.8%) high school coaches were required to have CPR training, and overall, 58.6% of high school coaches were required to have training in all 3 categories (CPR, AED, first aid) compared to 23.9% of club coaches (p<.001). CONCLUSIONS: High school sport coaches displayed greater levels of emergency preparedness and training compared to coaches of high school-aged club teams. Significant attention and effort is needed to improve emergency preparedness and medical coverage at the club sports level among basketball, soccer, and volleyball coaches.","2019","2020-05-20 00:11:48","2020-05-20 00:11:48","","N.PAG-N.PAG","","","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","","","","https://gateway.library.qut.edu.au/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=c8h&AN=136537098&site=ehost-live&scope=site","Congresses and Conferences -- Georgia; Georgia; Coaches, Athletic -- Psychosocial Factors; Emergency Care; Professional Knowledge; Schools, Secondary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Football helmets are constantly improving upon their predecessors and are proven to reduce head impact kinematics and the risk of sports-related head injury. All football helmets are required to pass certification testing overseen by the National Operating Committee on Standards for Athletic Equipment (NOCSAE) before they are permitted for use. A new advance in protective equipment involves coupling a helmet and shoulder pads as one connected piece of protective equipment. These protective gears cannot be tested using the standard NOCSAE method as they are worn over a user's head, neck, and upper torso. We aimed to test the effectiveness of a prototype of a coupled, one-piece design, relative to a standard football helmet, using a custom drop tower method of testing. Relative to the standard football helmet, the coupled design reduced measures of peak linear acceleration at front, side, and rear impacts (p <.001) and peak rotational acceleration at all tested head locations (p <.004). The coupled design was also more effective than the standard helmet in attenuating the resultant upper neck force (p <.004) at all tested head impact locations and resultant upper neck moment at rear and side impact locations (p <.048). Future iterations of coupled, one-piece designs should use the results of this study to make improvements to the device, and further investigations on the effectiveness and safety implications of the protective gear are necessary.

C.","Comparison of head impact biomechanics between tackle and flag youth football","Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine","","2325-9671","10.1177/2325967119S00001","","Background: There is growing fear among healthcare professionals and parents regarding youth tackle football, likely due to highly publicized concerns about potential long-term physical and cognitive health of professional football players. Parents and advocacy groups are pushing for state legislation to ban youth tackle football in favor of flag football to avoid repetitive head impacts that are potentially associated with late-life cognitive deficits. Although the head impact burden experienced during flag football is likely lower than tackle, no research has compared head impact exposure between youth tackle and flag football. Therefore, our purpose was to examine head impact exposure and magnitudes between youth tackle and flag football players. Methods: Twenty-seven tackle (age=11.0±1.5y, height=145.8±11.9cm, mass=45.0±14.9kg) and 29 flag football players (age=8.6±1.1y, height=133.9±8.4cm, mass=33.9±9.5kg) were enrolled in this prospective cohort study. Participants were fitted with head impact sensors (Triax Sim-G) worn throughout the entire 2017 season that recorded impact frequency and magnitude (linear [g] and rotational acceleration [rad/s2]). Athlete exposure was defined as one player participating in one session. Impact rates (IR) were calculated as impacts per one athlete exposure. Game, practice, and combined IR were compared between groups using impact rate ratios (IRR). IRR with 95% confidence intervals (CI) not containing 1.0 were considered statistically significant. Acceleration values were binned into low- and high-magnitude categories (linear split at 40g, rotational split at 4,600rad/s2). Magnitude category frequencies were compared between groups using Chi-square test of association (p<0.05), and 90th percentile acceleration values are presented. Results: One-thousand nine-hundred and eight tackle (735 game, 1173 practice; 70.66 impacts/player) and 169 flag (101 game, 68 practice; 5.83 impacts/player) football head impacts were recorded. Tackle players experienced a higher impact rate during games versus practices (IRR=1.41; 95%CI:1.29-1.55) while flag players experienced a lower impact rate (IRR=0.60; 95%CI:0.44-0.81). Practice and game head impacts combined resulted in tackle players (IR=3.06) accruing 4.61 times the impact rate (95%CI:3.94-5.40) of flag players (IR=0.66). Tackle players sustained a significantly greater head impact rate than flag players during games (tackle IR=3.83, flag IR=0.55; IRR=6.90; 95%CI:5.60-8.49) and practices (tackle IR=2.72, flag IR=0.93; IRR=2.91; 95%CI:2.28-3.72). Tackle 90th percentile linear acceleration was 53.32g (median=32.50g) and flag was 53.32g (median=32.65g). Tackle 90th percentile rotational acceleration was 7,000 rad/s2 (median=3,200rad/s2) while flag was 8,300 rad/s2 (median=4,100rad/s2). Tackle experienced a significantly higher frequency of low-magnitude rotational acceleration impacts (71.6% vs. 57.4%) and lower frequency of high-magnitude impacts than flag (28.4% vs 42.6%; ?2=15.15, p<0.001). There were no significant associations for linear acceleration (p=0.75). Conclusions/Significance: Our results indicate youth flag football head impact rates are 82%-88% lower compared to tackle. Contrary to general belief, youth flag football players experienced numerous head impacts with a greater tendency for high-magnitude rotational acceleration head impacts. Although fewer head impacts occur during youth flag football, parents and coaches should be aware that head impacts do occur during practices and games. Whether high-magnitude or high-frequency head impacts influence long-term health remains unknown. Our findings provide novel evidence into the head impact exposure occurring during youth tackle and flag football. Longitudinal studies examining head impact biomechanics and advanced neuroimaging in youth tackle and flag football players nationwide is warranted to ensure long term cognitive health.","2019","2020-05-20 00:11:52","2020-05-20 00:11:52","","","","3","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2325967119S00001; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L627389563","adult; conference abstract; female; football player; human; human experiment; male; acceleration; biomechanics; controlled study; prospective study; season; cohort analysis; juvenile; height; longitudinal study; cognitive defect; chi square test; head; sensor; neuroimaging","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Those studies imply accumulating damage from successive head impacts reduces tolerance and increases risk for concussion. Support for this premise is that biomechanics of head impacts resulting in concussion are often not remarkable when compared to impacts sustained by athletes without diagnosed concussion. Accordingly, this analysis quantified repetitive head impact exposure in a cohort of 50 concussed NCAA Division I FBS college football athletes compared to controls that were matched for team and position group. The analysis quantified the number of head impacts and risk weighted exposure both on the day of injury and for the season to the date of injury. 43% of concussed athletes had the most severe head impact exposure on the day of injury compared to their matched control group and 46% of concussed athletes had the most severe head impact exposure for the season to the date of injury compared to their matched control group. When accounting for date of injury or season to date of injury, 72% of all concussed athletes had the most or second most severe head impact exposure compared to their matched control group. These trends associating cumulative head impact exposure with concussion onset were stronger for athletes that participated in a greater number of contact activities. For example, 77% of athletes that participated in ten or more days of contact activities had greater head impact exposure than their matched control group. This unique analysis provided further evidence for the role of repetitive head impact exposure as a predisposing factor for the onset of concussion. The clinical implication of these findings supports contemporary trends of limiting head impact exposure for college football athletes during practice activities in an effort to also reduce risk of concussive injury.","2019","2020-05-20 00:11:54","2020-05-20 00:11:54","","2057-2072","","10","47","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L624756037; http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10439-018-02136-6","football player; human; article; sport injury; biomechanics; physical activity; priority journal; controlled study; major clinical study; cohort analysis; risk assessment; athletic performance; comparative study; brain contusion; evidence based medicine; injury severity; trend study","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study aimed to compare HIE in practice drills among 6 youth football teams and to evaluate the effect of a team on HIE. METHODS On-field head impact data were collected from athletes (ages 10–13 years) playing on 6 local youth football teams (teams A–F) during all practices using the Head Impact Telemetry System. Video was recorded and analyzed to verify and assign impacts to a specific drill. Drills were identified as follows: dummy/sled tackling, half install, install, install walk through, multiplayer tackle, Oklahoma, one-on-one, open field tackling, other, passing, position skill work, scrimmage, special teams, tackling drill stations, and technique. HIE was quantified in terms of impacts per player per minute (ppm) and peak linear and rotational head acceleration. Generalized linear models were used to assess differences in head impact magnitude and frequency among drills as well as among teams within the most common drills. RESULTS Among 67 athlete-seasons, a total of 14,718 impacts during contact practices were collected and evaluated in this study. Among all 6 teams, the mean linear (p < 0.0001) and rotational (p < 0.0001) acceleration varied significantly among all drills. Open field tackling had significantly (p < 0.001) higher mean linear acceleration than all other drills. Multiplayer tackle had the highest mean impact rate (0.35 ppm). Significant variations in linear acceleration and impact rate were observed among teams within specific drills. Team A had the highest mean linear acceleration in install, one-on-one, and open field tackling and the highest mean impact rate in Oklahoma and position skill work. Although team A spent the greatest proportion of their practice on minimal- or no-player versus player contact drills (27%) compared to other teams, they had the highest median (20.2g) and 95th percentile (56.4g) linear acceleration in practice. CONCLUSIONS Full-speed tackling and blocking drills resulted in the highest HIE. Reducing time spent on contact drills relative to minimal or no contact drills may not lower overall HIE. Instead, interventions such as reducing the speed of players engaged in contact, correcting tackling technique, and progressing to contact may reduce HIE more effectively.","2019","2020-05-20 00:11:55","2020-05-20 00:11:55","","381-389","","3","23","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.3171/2018.9.PEDS18314; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2001869701","football player; human; article; football; acceleration; clinical article; priority journal; controlled study; accelerometry; adolescent; body mass; helmet; body weight; child; head injury; school child; body height; comparative study; head impact exposure; surgical drill; telemetry","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The present study used time-motion analysis and triax-ial-accelerometers to obtain new insights about the impact of different tactical systems (1-4-5-1 and 1-3-5-2) on physical performance, across different playing positions, in a professional football team. Player performance data in fifteen official home matches was collected for analysis. The sample included twenty-two players from five playing positions (centre backs: n = 4; full-back/wide midfielder/ wing-back: n = 9; centre midfielder: n = 6 and centre forward: n = 3), making a total of 108 match observations. A novel finding was that general match physical demands do not differ considerably between these tactical formations, probably because match-to-match variability (variation of players’ running profile from match-to-match) might be higher than the differences in physical performance between tactical systems. However, change of formation had a different impact across playing positions, with centre backs playing in 1-4-5-1 performing significant more HIRcounts than in 1-3-5-2 (p = 0.031). Furthermore, a medium effect size (r = 0.33) was observed in HIRdist, with wide players covering higher distances when playing in 1-3-5-2 than in 1-4-5-1. These findings may help coaches to develop individualised training programs to meet the demands of each playing position according to the tactical system adopted.","2019","2020-05-20 00:11:57","2020-05-20 00:11:57","","","","4","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0214952; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2001789722","adult; football player; human; article; football; controlled study; accelerometer; physical performance; training; running; effect size; athletic performance; comparative study; analytic method; coping behavior; match physical demand; sports science; tactical system; time motion analysis; triaxial accelerometer","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Most performance indicators of Aviva Premiership and Guinness Pro 12 rugby competitions were similar but distinctive from French Top 14 and Super Rugby competitions, which in turn were generally similar. The Aviva Premiership and Guinness Pro 12 had similar numbers of ball carries, tries, offloads, kicks, tackles, line-outs and scrums that were significantly higher than French Top 14 and Super Rugby. Offloads (p =.0015) and tries (p =.0368) were significantly higher for Super Rugby than the Guinness Pro 12, but the Guinness Pro 12 had significantly higher counts for carries (p ≤.0001), passes (p =.0010) and kicks (p =.0054). In contrast, counts of tackle breaks (p ≤.0001) and line breaks were significantly higher for Super Rugby in comparison to the Aviva Premiership (p =.0057), Guinness Pro 12 (p =.0064) and French Top 14 (p ≤.0001). All competitions showed areas of weakness and strength, which could be due to specific game plans followed in the unique pitch and weather conditions during competition.

Muscle synergies among subjects were compared. Non-negative matrix factorization was used to extract muscle synergies from electromyographic data. Thereafter, to compare muscle synergies, a scalar product evaluating synergy coincidence was calculated. Three muscle synergies were extracted in both groups from non-negative matrix factorization analysis. In both groups, two out of three synergies were found to be the same by scalar product analysis. In one of these synergies, the oblique muscle, rectus femoris, and adductor muscle were activated before landing in mid-stance during the sidestep motion in the control group. Therefore, this synergy is thought to suppress excessive hip abduction. However, the peak timing of this synergy in the groin pain group was at mid-stance. This delay may cause hip instability because muscles must be activated before landing to enhance joint stability. Risk factors for groin pain are dysfunctional coordination between trunk and lower-limb muscles and decreased hip stability. Even though the number of subjects in this study was small, it is possible that delayed activation of this synergy may be related to the mechanism of injury in groin pain.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of a 6-month training period, using part 2 of the FIFA11+ program (the Fédération Internationale de Football), on the activation and strength of core and lower limb muscles and on static and dynamic balance performance. Study Design: Case series; level of evidence, 4. Methods: Eight college male soccer players, aged mean 20.4 ± 0.5 years old, completed the FIFA11+ program at least three times per week for 6 months. The following variables were measured both before and after the 6-month training program: activities of more than 30 muscles (core and lower limb muscles), measured using the standardized uptake values of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose on positron emission tomography; isokinetic strength of the knee flexor and extensor and hip abductor muscles, measured at 60° s−1; static balance over a 60-s period, measured using a gravicorder; and dynamic balance, measured using the star excursion balance test. Results: Training improved the activity levels of core (obliquus externus abdominis and erector spinae) and lower limb (tibialis anterior) muscles (p ≤ 0.03), corrected the between-limb difference in the activation of the semimembranosus and improved dynamic balance, with a greater training effect on the nondominant limb (p ≤ 0.02). Training also improved the knee flexor force of the nondominant lower limb (p = 0.02). Conclusion: Routine performance of the FIFA11+ program can improve the activation of core and lower limb muscles, with a concomitant improvement in dynamic balance. These improvements could be beneficial in lowering the risk of sports-related injuries.","2019","2020-05-20 00:12:00","2020-05-20 00:12:00","","","","1","28","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2309499019891541; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2003963771","adult; human; male; article; soccer player; young adult; muscle training; muscle contraction; muscle strength; body equilibrium; tibialis anterior muscle; positron emission tomography; college student; erector spinae muscle; evidence based practice; fluorodeoxyglucose f 18; oblique external abdominal muscle; semimembranosus muscle","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The two bars loaded at 30% 1-repetition maximum were compared with ten trained Division I American football players (n = 10; age = 19.5 years; body mass = 89.4 kg; body height = 182.0 cm) completing 10 repetitions of the back squat exercise. Analysis included integrated-peak values of electromyography of the rectus femoris, biceps femoris, rectus abdominis, erector spinae, external oblique, vastus lateralis, ground reaction forces, and joint kinematics and kinetics of the hip, knee, and ankle. The flexible bar elicited significant increases in peak joint kinetics (Hip Moment: 229 ± 54 Nm vs. 209 ± 52 Nm; Hip Power: 494 ± 151 W vs. 382 ± 134 W; Knee Power: 305 ± 108 W vs. 241 ± 63 W), peak vertical ground reaction forces (1195 ± 209 N vs. 1120 ± 203 N), and muscle activity (Vastus Lateralis: 75.7 vs. 66.5%, Rectus Abdominis: 190 vs. 115%, Rectus Femoris: 69.8 vs. 59.9%, External Oblique: 115 vs. 69.0%). Greater vertical ground reaction forces, hip moment, hip power, knee power, and muscle activity of the vastus lateralis, rectus abdominis, rectus femoris, and external oblique suggest the FB provides biomechanical and physiological mechanisms for training gains over the SB for 30% of 1-repetition maximum loads.

Comparison of physical fitness and anthropometrical profiles among Brazilian female soccer national teams from U15 to senior categories. J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2019-This study aimed to compare anthropometric and physical fitness of Brazilian female national team soccer players from the U15 to senior categories, and to compare the physical performance between selected and nonselected players. Subjects included 231 athletes (U15, n = 46, U17, n = 49, U20, n = 98, and Senior, n = 38). Body mass, height, sum of skinfolds, squat jump (SJ), countermovement jump (CMJ), 20-m linear sprint, and Yo-Yo IR1 were assessed. The U15 players were shorter than all other groups (p < 0.01) and lighter than U20 players (p < 0.01). Regarding physical tests, Senior athletes presented higher SJ compared with U20, and both showed higher CMJ and SJ compared with the U15 and U17 (p < 0.05). Senior athletes were also faster than players of all other categories in 20-m sprint (p < 0.01) and covered the greatest distance in the Yo-Yo IR1 (p < 0.05). U20 were better in the Yo-Yo IR1 than the younger groups (p < 0.05). When comparing selected and nonselected players, no differences were identified in anthropometric measures (p > 0.05). However, selected players from U17, U20, and Senior teams showed better performance in Yo-Yo IR1 than nonselected ones (p < 0.05). Finally, selected senior athletes also presented higher CMJ and SJ than nonselected players (p < 0.05). These results suggest that, although there is a tendency for maintenance in anthropometric measures from the age of 15 years, there are substantial improvements in speed, lower-body power, and aerobic capacity from U20 age group. In addition, it seems that intermittent aerobic fitness contributes to the selection of players to international tournaments in national teams.","2019","2020-05-20 00:12:02","2020-05-20 00:12:02","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1519/JSC.0000000000003140; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L627517677","female; human; article; soccer player; aerobic capacity; controlled study; major clinical study; physical performance; adolescent; velocity; height; fitness; Brazilian; skinfold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 47 professional, male football and basketball players from Pro League in Iran participated. They were divided into 3 groups. Group 1 included 16 participants with history of grade 1 or 2 single ankle sprain within the past 6 months. Group 2 included 17 participants with recurrent ankle sprain. Group 3 included 14 participants without history of ankle sprain. Static and dynamic balance were measured by the Balance Error Scoring System (BESS) and modified Star Excursion Balance Test (SEBT), respectively. RESULTS: For the single-leg stance on a firm surface, group 2 scored errors with a high mean value of 3.94 compared with the other 2 groups, and the difference was statistically significant (P = .03). Significant differences in BESS scores are observed on both surfaces across the tandem limb between groups 2 and 3. CONCLUSION: The measures from the SEBTs may not reflect the balance performance especially in well-trained athletes who have a better balance when performing sport-related skills. However, BESS includes static postures, and it may reflect postural deficits better than dynamic tests in the more experienced athlete.

Athletes were monitored while in-season with subjective workload monitoring using rating of perceived exertion (RPE) and objective workload monitoring using a GPS tracking system. Injuries were also tracked in all athletes to evaluate if RPE-based acute-to-chronic (A:C) workload predicts injury. Results: At interim analysis 57 soccer athletes were evaluated, 30 female, 27 male. Rugby season has not yet started. RPE was found to be significant (P-value). Conclusions: Subjective workload monitoring of athletes correlates strongly with objective monitoring. At the time of interim analysis, it remains to be determined if RPE-based A:C monitoring predicts injury. Significance: To our knowledge this study is the first to show that subjective workload monitoring correlates with objective measures. This may allow for a less costly and time-intensive approach to workload monitoring available to broader athlete populations.","2019","2020-05-20 00:12:04","2020-05-20 00:12:04","","124","","2","29","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/JSM.0000000000000724; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629860224","adult; conference abstract; female; human; male; rugby; soccer; injury; exercise; controlled study; season; workload; athlete","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Successful offensive sequences performed in the group stage by eliminated (n = 39) and qualified teams (n = 83) were notated post-event using an adapted version of the Offensive Sequences Characterisation System, which includes simple and composite performance indicators. Magnitude-based inferences revealed that performances indicators Passes/Duration, Passes/Ball touches, Players/Duration and Passes/Players were key to differentiate eliminated and qualified teams. Performance profiles emerging from qualified teams suggest the ability to impose a faster game pace (of ball passing and collective involvement) is more relevant to offensive effectiveness in elite football than the mere amount of sport-specific actions performed. Although offensive sequences with more passes, ball touches and duration had a possible positive effect on reaching the knockout phase, the offensive behaviours of qualified teams highlighted the importance of 'quality possession'. Indeed, offensive sequences involving more players (teamwork) and favouring ball passing instead of individual ball retention seem to facilitate the emergence of goal-scoring events. Considering these findings, professional coaches are encouraged to design playing-form activities aiming to promote team-based offensive strategies, including task constraints to increase the game pace and the frequency of 'penetrating passes' into vital playing areas.

Sport participation characteristics may vary widely between the high school and club sport settings. However, there have been no large-scale comparisons of sport participation volume between high school and club teams from similar sports. Purpose/Hypothesis: The purpose of this study was to compare the sport participation characteristics of high school and high school–aged club teams. We hypothesized that club team athletes would participate in more months per year and hours per week and would take more overnight trips than high school athletes and that club team coaches would be less likely to track their athletes’ sport volume than high school coaches. Study Design: Cross-sectional study. Methods: A total of 769 coaches (266 female; 34.6%) from 3 sports (basketball, volleyball, soccer) completed an anonymous online questionnaire regarding their team’s sport volume and their knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs regarding sport specialization. Coaches were eligible to participate if they had served as the head or assistant coach of a high school sport team or high school–aged club sport team in the past 12 months. Results: Overall, 64.6% (n = 497) were coaches of a high school team, and 35.4% (n = 272) were coaches of a club team with high school–aged athletes. Club coaches’ teams played more months out of the year and took more overnight trips for competitions than high school coaches’ teams but participated in fewer hours per week of practices or competitions during their season. There were no differences between club and high school coaches in tracking their athletes’ sport volume, with most coaches in both settings reporting that they do not track the amount of time that their athletes participate in other sports. Conclusion: Significant differences in sport participation volume exist between the teams of high school and club coaches.","2019","2020-05-20 00:12:06","2020-05-20 00:12:06","","","","4","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2325967119836484; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L627127406","adult; female; human; human experiment; article; soccer; basketball; major clinical study; season; team sport; competition; athlete; high school; questionnaire; cross-sectional study; volleyball; accident prevention; head; specialization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: This cost effectiveness analysis was based on data collected in a cluster randomised controlled trial over one season from football teams (under-9 to under-13 age groups) in Switzerland. The intervention group (INT) replaced their usual warmup with '11+ Kids', while the control group (CON) warmed up as usual. Injuries, healthcare resource use and football exposure (in hours) were collected prospectively. We calculated the mean injury related costs in Swiss Francs (CHF) per 1000 hours of football. We calculated the cost effectiveness (the direct net healthcare costs divided by the net health effects of the '11+ Kids' intervention) based on the actual data in our study (trial based) and for a countrywide implementation scenario (model based). RESULTS: Costs per 1000 hours of exposure were CHF228.34 (95% CI 137.45, 335.77) in the INT group and CHF469.00 (95% CI 273.30, 691.11) in the CON group. The cost difference per 1000 hours of exposure was CHF-240.66 (95%CI -406.89, -74.32). A countrywide implementation would reduce healthcare costs in Switzerland by CHF1.48 million per year. 1002 players with a mean age of 10.9 (SD 1.2) years participated. During 76 373 hours of football, 99 injuries occurred. CONCLUSION: The '11+ Kids' programme reduced the healthcare costs by 51% and was dominant (ie, the INT group had lower costs and a lower injury risk) compared with a usual warmup. This provides a compelling case for widespread implementation.","2019","2020-05-20 00:12:07","2020-05-20 00:12:07","","309-314","","5","53","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bjsports-2018-099395; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L626460393","female; human; male; soccer; sport injury; controlled study; injuries; randomized controlled trial; warm up; child; youth sport; cost benefit analysis; health care cost; Switzerland","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: Twenty semi-professional soccer players volunteered for the study of which 14 participated in the first part of the study which assessed 90:20 reliability (age = 21.3 ± 2.5 years, height = 1.79 ± 0.07 m, body mass = 73.2 ± 8.8 kg), while 17 completed the second part of the study evaluating fatigue-recovery (age 21.2±2.4 yrs., height = 180 ± 0.09 m, body mass 73.8 ± 8.9 kg). We evaluated the inter-session reliability of IPF in two 90:20 test protocols (hands on the wall (HW); and hands on chest (HC)) both performed on two occasions, 7 days apart. We then assessed 90:20 (HC) and 90:90 IPF immediately before (PRE) and after (POST) after a simulated soccer match protocol (BEAST90mod) and 48 (+48 h) and 72 hours (+72 h) later. Results: Part one: the 90:20 showed moderate to high overall reliability (CV's of 7.3% to 11.0%) across test positions and limbs. CV's were lower in the HW than HC in the dominant (7.3% vs 11.0%) but the opposite happened in the non-dominant limb where CV's were higher in the HW than HC (9.7% vs 7.3%). Based on these results, the HC position was used in part two of the study. Part two: 90:20 and 90:90 IPF was significantly lower POST compared to PRE BEAST90mod across all testing positions (p<0.001). IPF was significantly lower at +48 h compared to PRE in the 90:20 in both limbs (Dominant: p<0.01,Non-dominant: p0.05), but not in the 90:90. At +72 h, IPF was not significantly different from PRE in either test. Conclusions: Simple to implement posterior IPF tests can help to define recovery from competition and training load in football and, potentially, in other multiple sprint athletes. Testing posterior chain IPF in a more knee extended 90:20 position may provide greater sensitivity to fatigue at 48 h post simulated competition than testing in the 90:90 position, but also may require greater degree of familiarization due to more functional testing position.","2019","2020-05-20 00:12:08","2020-05-20 00:12:08","","","","5","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0206561; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002215874","adult; human; human experiment; male; article; soccer; controlled study; athlete; body mass; muscle function; muscle strength; normal human; body height; reliability; simulation; volunteer; comparative study; muscle isometric contraction; function test; functional assessment; hands on chest test; hands on the wall test; leg muscle; muscle fatigue","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Revista Internacional de Ciencias del Deporte","","18853137","","","The aim of this study was to compare the physical and physiological demands of friendly matches (FM) with different types of standard training sessions (TRs) undertaken by professional soccer players. Maximal velocity (MV), relative distance (m/min), distance covered in different high velocity and acceleration-deceleration zones, player load, repeated high intensity efforts and Edwards' TRIMP were assessed in 15 professional Spanish soccer players across the preseason period. Training sessions were classified under: tactical, pre-match activation, fitness-reserves and fitness sessions. Differences between FM and TRs, were analyzed for practical significance using magnitude-based inferences. MV and relative distance were substantially higher in FM than in tactical sessions (effect size, ES=1.69, large and 3.73, very large), activation sessions (ES=2.07, very large and 2.30, very large), fitness-reserves sessions (ES=2.85, very large and 4.47, very large) and fitness sessions (ES=2.30, very large and 6.30, very large) respectively. No substantial differences were observed in distance covered in high acceleration zone (>3 m·s-2) between FM and activation, fitness-reserves and fitness sessions. TRIMPs obtained during FM were substantially higher than in tactical (ES= 5.37, very large), activation (ES=5.03, very large), fitness-reserves (ES=3.82, very large) and fitness sessions (ES=5.61, very large). It can be concluded from this study that FMs produce the highest loaded training stimulus when compared across most metrics used for training analysis comparisons across the preseason period. As a result the use of FMs within the pre-season phase of the season should warrant additional care when planned between high intensity and high volume training loads. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR El objetivo de esta investigación fue comparar las demandas físicas y fisiológicas de partidos amistosos (PA), con las derivadas de diferentes tipos de sesiones de entrenamiento (TRs) realizadas por futbolistas profesionales. 15 futbolistas profesionales españoles fueron monitorizados en pretemporada en las siguientes variables: velocidad máxima (VM), distancia relativa (m/min), distancia recorrida en diferentes zonas de velocidad y aceleración, secuencias de alta intensidad repetidas, player load y TRIMP Edwards. Las TRs fueron clasificadas en: tácticas, activación pre-partido, condición física de jugadores reservas y condición física. Se evaluaron las diferencias entre PA y TRs a través de inferencias basadas en magnitudes. La VM y la distancia relativa fueron substancialmente mayores en PA que en la sesiones tácticas (tamaño del efecto, TE=1.69, grande y 3.73, muy grande), sesiones activación (TE=2.07, muy grande y 2.30, muy grande), condición física-reservas (TE=2.85, muy grande y 4.47, muy grande) y condición física (TE=2.30, muy grande y 6.30, muy grande) respectivamente. No se observaron diferencias substanciales en la distancia recorrida a alta aceleración (>3 m·s-2) entre PA y sesiones activación, condición física y condición física-reservas. Sin embargo, los TRIMPs obtenidos durante PA fueron substancialmente mayores que en las sesiones tácticas (TE=5.27, muy grande), activación (TE=5.03, muy grande), condición física-reservas (TE=3.82, muy grande), y condición física (CV=5.61, muy grande). Como conclusión, los PA constituyen el estímulo de entrenamiento con mayor sobrecarga de la pretemporada, para la mayoría de variables analizadas. Por lo tanto se debería prestar especial atención, cuando se juegan PA en pretemporada intercalados entre sesiones de alta intensidad y alto volumen.

A comparison of training modality and total genotype scores to enhance sport-specific biomotor abilities in under 19 male soccer players. J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2019-Soccer-specific training (SST) and small-sided games (SSGs) have been shown to develop physical proficiency in soccer. Research on genetics and epigenetics in the prescription of training is limited. The aims of this study were to compare the impact of 3 different SST/SSG methods and investigate if a total genotype score (TGS) influences training response. Subjects (n = 30 male soccer players, mean ± SD; age 17.2 ± 0.9 years, stature = 172.6 ± 6.2 cm; body mass = 71.7 ± 10.1 kg) were stratified into a ""power"" (PG) or ""endurance"" (EG) gene profile group, where a 15 single nucleotide polymorphism panel was used to produce an algorithmically weighted TGS. Training 1 (T1-SSGs only), training 2 (T2-SSGs/SST), and training 3 (T3-SST only) were completed (in that respective order), lasting 8 weeks each, interspersed by 4-week washouts. Acceleration (10-m sprint) was improved by T2 only (1.84 ± 0.09 seconds vs. 1.73 ± 0.05 seconds; Effect Size [ES] = 1.59, p < 0.001). Speed (30-m sprint) was improved by T2 (4.46 ± 0.22 seconds vs. 4.30 ± 0.19 seconds; ES = 0.81, p < 0.001) and T3 (4.48 ± 0.22 seconds vs. 4.35 ± 0.21 seconds; ES = 0.58, p < 0.001). Agility (T-test) was improved by T1 (10.14 ± 0.40 seconds vs. 9.84 ± 0.42 seconds; ES = 0.73, p < 0.05) and T3 (9.93 ± 0.38 seconds vs. 9.66 ± 0.45 seconds; ES = 0.66, p < 0.001). Endurance (Yo-Yo level 1) was improved by T1 (1,682.22 ± 497.23 m vs. 2,028.89 ± 604.74 m; ES = 0.63, p < 0.05), T2 (1,904.35 ± 526.77 m vs. 2,299.13 ± 606.97 m; ES = 0.69, p < 0.001), and T3 (1,851.76 ± 490.46 m vs. 2,024.35 ± 588.13 m; ES = 0.35, p < 0.05). Power (countermovement jump) was improved by T3 only (36.01 ± 5.73 cm vs. 37.14 ± 5.62 cm; ES = 0.20, p < 0.05). There were no differences in T1, T2, and T3 combined when comparing PG and EG. The PG reported significantly (χ(20) = 4.42, p = 0.035, ES = 0.48) better training responses to T3 for power than the EG. These results demonstrate the efficacy of SSGs and SSTs in developing biomotor abilities. Although these results refute talent identification through the use of a TGS, there may be use in aligning the training method to TGS to develop power-based qualities in soccer.","2019","2020-05-20 00:12:12","2020-05-20 00:12:12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1519/JSC.0000000000003299; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L630061125","human; human experiment; male; article; soccer player; acceleration; clinical article; controlled study; adolescent; agility; endurance; body height; effect size; prescription; genetic association; gene frequency; drug efficacy; epigenetics; genetic profile; single nucleotide polymorphism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cardiovascular system diseases are responsible for the majority of sudden cardiac deaths in athletes. Although aortic rupture is known to be among the potential cardiovascular causes of sudden cardiac death in athletes, the relationship between the type of sport performed and aortic remodeling or vascular adaptation is not fully known. The aim of this study is to compare the echocardiographic measurements of aortic diameter in endurance and strength athletes and to determine whether vascular adaptation varies according to the type of sport. Methods: The sample of the study consisted of endurance (football) (n=34) and strength (n=36) athletes who applied to the cardiology outpatient clinic of a university hospital between January 2017 and December 2018 for sports health screening. The non-athletes (n=34) control group of similar age group were included in the study. Demographic, clinical and echocardiographic (aortic annulus, sinus valsalva, synotubular junction and ascending aorta) data of all participants (n=104) was recorded. Comparisons between the data of the three groups One-Way ANOVA test and Tukey test were used to determine which group caused the difference. Results: All participants were male and the mean age was 25.07±3.98 years. It was determined that endurance athletes performed regular sports for 9.61±2.93 years, strength athletes for 7.91±4.61 years and weekly training periods were 6.82±1.38 and 7.91±1.05 hours, respectively. There was a significant difference between the groups in terms of body mass index and body surface area (p=0.001 and p=0.002, respectively). When resting heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements of the groups were compared; endurance athletes' heart rate was significantly lower than strength athletes and control group (p<0.001), strength athletes' systolic and diastolic blood pressures were significantly higher than endurance athletes and control group (p<0.001). When the groups were compared in terms of aortic measurements; aortic annulus, sinus valsalva and ascending aorta diameters were significantly higher in endurance athletes compared to strength athletes and control group (p<0.001), sinotubular junction diameter was significantly higher in endurance and strength athletes than control group (p<0.001) (Table 1). Conclusions: As a result of this study, it was found that vascular adaptation or remodeling in the aortic root caused by hemodynamic overload was more prominent especially in endurance athletes. Endurance athletes should be evaluated more carefully in terms of aortic root dilatation when pre-competition health screening is performed.","2019","2020-05-20 00:12:13","2020-05-20 00:12:13","","60","","","22","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629806082","adult; conference abstract; human; male; football; controlled study; major clinical study; competition; analysis of variance; body mass; endurance athlete; dilatation; sudden cardiac death; aortic root; aortic sinus; ascending aorta; diastolic blood pressure; resting heart rate; body surface; aortic rupture; cardiology; mass screening; outpatient department; university hospital; vascular ring","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: Certified athletic trainers at 13 high school football programs in north central Florida collected WBGT measurements for each football practice via handheld heat stress monitors (Monitor) and WBGT reported through the WeatherFx smartphone app (App) from August 1, 2016 to October 31, 2016. Results: When looking at WBGT across all time points, pre-practice WBGT readings with the Monitor measured 80.4°F ± 5.5 while the App measured 85.8°F ± 5.9. Post-practice WBGT measured with the Monitor was 78.4°F ± 5.7 compared to 83.4°F ± 8.3. Pearson correlation between the Monitor and the App for all time points showed a correlation coefficient of 0.58 with a P < 0.001. The difference in WBGT between the monitor and the App was 25.9°F ± 5.4, 25.1°F ± 5.7, 23.3°F ± 4.9, 23.4°F ± 7.4, and 23.3°F ± 7.8, respectively, for the following NATA WBGT-based activity modification categories: <82°F, 82.0 to 86.9°F, 87.0 to 89.9°F, 90.0 to 92.0° and .92.1°F. Conclusions: Smartphone app WBGT measurements did not provide a clinically comparable WBGT measurement versus WBGT handheld monitors as the app readings were significantly higher across all time points which would lead to unnecessary practice modifications if used in place of WBGT handheld monitors. Significance: While handheld heat stress monitors may require more financial resources than a smartphone app, they should remain as the gold standard for measuring WBGT to ensure an accurate determination of local heat safety guidelines.","2019","2020-05-20 00:12:14","2020-05-20 00:12:14","","168-169","","2","29","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/JSM.0000000000000725; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629860381","conference abstract; human; football; controlled study; high school; gold standard; practice guideline; correlation coefficient; athletic trainer; Florida; heat stress; smartphone; temperature measurement; thermometer","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Head impact frequency and magnitude (linear acceleration [g], rotational acceleration [rad/s2]) were collected from 25 tackle and 25 flag youth football players over one season. Athlete exposure (AE) was defined as one player participating in one session. Head impact rates (IR) were calculated and impact rate ratios (IRR) were used to compare youth tackle and flag football. Random-intercept generalized logit models with odds ratios compared the probabilities of sustaining an impact with a linear acceleration of 20.00-29.99g, 30.00-39.99g, and ≥40.00g against the reference of 14.00-19.99g and an impact with a rotational acceleration of 2500.00-7499.99 rad/s2 or ≥7500.00 rad/s2 against the reference of ≤2499.99 rad/s2 between youth flag and tackle football. We observed 1908 tackle football head impacts (735 in games, 38.5%) across 624 AE and 169 flag football head impacts (101 in games, 59.8%) across 255 AE. Youth tackle football players experienced higher overall IR (3.06, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.61, 3.58; IRR = 4.61, 95% CI: 3.94, 5.40) compared with flag football (IR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.57, 0.78). Youth flag football players had lower odds of sustaining impacts >20g but higher odds of sustaining impacts between 2500.00-7499.99 rad/s2 compared with youth tackle players. Our preliminary sample of youth flag football players sustained less frequent head impacts at higher rotational accelerations than tackle football players. Flag football is considered a limited-contact sport, but little is known about the true head impact burden. Our findings may be important for policymakers when debating potential changes to youth football participation.","2019","2020-05-20 00:12:15","2020-05-20 00:12:15","","1752-1757","","11","36","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2018.6236; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L627971291","human; male; article; football; sport injury; acceleration; biomechanics; clinical article; controlled study; major clinical study; athlete; risk assessment; child; head injury; school child; disease burden; probability; traumatic brain injury; comparative study; high risk population; injury severity; analytical parameters; game; low risk population; statistical model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Main findings were: i) with the exception of clustering coefficients which indicate the level of interconnectivity between close teammates (win = draw > loss), match outcome was unaffected by ball possession, running and network measures; iii) teams employing a1‒4‒2‒3‒1 formation reported greater values for ball possession, TDIP, and micro/macro network measures compared to those playing 1‒4‒4‒2 and 1‒4‒3‒3 formations; iv) TDIP tended to be related to most player prominence variables, even though the magnitude of coefficients varied considerably according to network measures and playing positions. This study has provided additional insights into elite soccer match-play performance.

N.; Edwards, R.; Hoek, J.","Competing teammates: food in New Zealand sports settings","Health promotion international","","1460-2245","10.1093/heapro/day035","","Despite the global popularity of sport, we know surprisingly little about food in sports settings. This two-phased study analysed the foods available in New Zealand sports settings. Phase one included a systematic literature review and 18 interviews with key informants from national and regional sporting organizations. Phase two involved 37 key informant interviews with stakeholders from two exemplar sports, rugby and netball and direct observations at netball and rugby venues. This study found most foods and beverages at New Zealand sports events were energy-dense and nutrient-poor. Caterers' control over food provision, socio-cultural attitudes which view unhealthy foods as normal, and a dominant profit motive, appear to be the key factors influencing the food environment in sports settings. Food environments in sport settings provide frequent opportunities to purchase and consume energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods. The research shows we have competing players in the sports context-unhealthy food and healthy physical activity. Achieving sustainable healthy change in sports settings will be challenging when the prevailing attitude normalizes the unhealthy environment. Nutrition policies in sports clubs are urgently needed to increase the availability of healthy food. This requires support from health agencies and leadership from national sports organizations. Given the international nature of the food industry and sport, these findings from New Zealand may assist other countries to better understand the nature of food in sport and adopt appropriate interventions to reduce the obesogenic environment that is sport.","2019","2020-05-20 00:12:18","2020-05-20 00:12:18","","803-810","","4","34","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/heapro/day035; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629285115","human; sport; food; beverage; catering service; commercial phenomena; New Zealand; nutritional value","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The sample was composed of 5,942 roller hockey games (2,044 in Spanish male league, 1,580 in Spanish female league, 1,814 in Portuguese male league and 504 in Portuguese female league) between the 2009-2010 and 2017-18 seasons. To calculate the competitive balance, it was used the Accumulated Points Difference index andthe one way ANOVA followed by Tukey Post Hoc multiple comparison test. The results showed that male leagues are more balanced than female (71.41±11.29 vs. 79.65±5.75 for Spanish leagues and 75.56±7.54 vs. 80.16±15.01 for Portuguese leagues). The results in relation to the sex of participants are consistent with previous studies in other sports like football. The analysis of the competitive balance could be useful for the governing body of Roller Hockey Federations to have quantitative data of the equality that exists in each league and to asses if it is necessary to introduce changes in the competition to make it more equalized in order to increase the audience.

Etiology includes neonatal lupus, structural heart disease, and idiopathic familial congenital complete heart block (CHB). Case: This is a 20-year-old male who underwent surgical removal of an ingrown toenail and was noted to have an abnormal electrocardiogram revealing CHB following the procedure. He actively participates in football, soccer, and baseball. He has no history of syncope or decreased exercise tolerance, and there is no family history of sudden cardiac or unexplained death. Throughout his admission, he remained in CHB with resting rate in the 30s and narrow complex QRS with duration of 98 ms and was completely asymptomatic. Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed no abnormalities. Electrolytes, Lyme titers, and thyroid-stimulating hormone were within normal limits. Exercise treadmill testing was performed after hospital discharge. He exercised for over 12 minutes going to stage V of Bruce protocol, stopping the test only for leg fatigue. At baseline, he demonstrated sinus rhythm with atrioventricular (AV) dissociation and a junctional escape rhythm of 59 beats per minute (bpm), rising to 144 bpm at peak exercise. Throughout all Bruce stages and recovery, he demonstrated AV dissociation with a junctional rhythm that augmented well with activity. Decision-making: Our patient presented with asymptomatic CHB at the age of 20. After hospital discharge, his resting junctional rate was in the 50s, and he remained asymptomatic with exercise. He has no structural heart disease and has normal systolic function. Given his young age and lack of symptoms, we elected to defer pacemaker implantation. Conclusion: Up to 40% of cases of congenital heart block present in later childhood. Speculated causes for late presentation include intermittent early course or a higher ventricular rate of the escape rhythm. The treatment of congenital heart block remains controversial. Our patient will be monitored with intermittent exercise treadmill tests, Holter monitoring, and assessment of symptoms.","2019","2020-05-20 00:12:21","2020-05-20 00:12:21","","2455","","9 Supplement 1","73","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2001643229; http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0735-1097(19)33061-X","adult; conference abstract; human; male; football; soccer; major clinical study; young adult; decision making; leg; child; fatigue; transthoracic echocardiography; surgery; hospital discharge; endogenous compound; electrolyte; baseball; family history; congenital malformation; faintness; atrioventricular dissociation; atrioventricular junction arrhythmia; childhood; complete heart block; congenital disorder; congenital heart block; death; exercise tolerance; Holter monitoring; infant; ingrown nail; pacemaker implantation; sinus rhythm; systemic lupus erythematosus; thyrotropin; treadmill","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: Participants in this study involved 829 interscho-lastic girls' soccer players aged 13 to 18 years old, 394 intercollegiate female and 377 intercollegiate male soccer players aged 18 to 22 years old. A designated individual collected heading data using a simple tally system. Purposeful headers (clear, pass, shot) as well as unintentional head impacts and total headers were tabulated across all players. Results: For the interscholastic players, the total average headers/game exposure for the 10-year period studied was 1.68 headers/game exposure. For the collegiate women, the total average headers/practice exposure during the 15-year period studied was 1.59, whereas for games, the total average headers/game exposure was 2.36. On the men's side, the total average header/practice exposure for the 15-year period studied was 1.11, whereas for games, the total average header/game exposure was 3.55. On further delineation, headers by pass were the highest for all cohorts, followed by clears, shots and unintentional deflections. Conclusions: Our data suggest that in our cohorts of soccer players, the exposure to soccer heading in both practice and game settings is relatively low; thus, exposure to RHI from heading is small. Our female participants experienced fewer headers in relation to our male players and passing headers accounted for the majority of the heading impacts. Significance: Purposeful heading in soccer has drawn increasing scrutiny over the past 10 years due to the concern of potential deleterious effects of RHI on brain structure and function, yet our data shows that frequency of exposure is actually quite small.","2019","2020-05-20 00:12:25","2020-05-20 00:12:25","","161","","2","29","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/JSM.0000000000000726; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629860182","adult; conference abstract; female; human; human experiment; male; soccer player; brain; major clinical study; adolescent; cohort analysis; young adult; child; structure activity relation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study investigated the barriers to coaches of adolescent female soccer teams, in Victoria, Australia, implementing the evidence-based FIFA 11+ injury prevention programme. METHODS: Concept mapping with data collected from 19 soccer coaches and administrators. RESULTS: Brainstorming generated 65 statements as barriers to 11+ implementation. After the statements were synthesised and edited, participants sorted 59 statements into groups (mean, 6.2 groups; range, 3-10 groups). Multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analysis identified a six-cluster solution: Lack of 11+ knowledge among coaches (15 statements), Lack of player enjoyment and engagement (14), Lack of link to football-related goals (11), Lack of facilities and resources (8), Lack of leadership (6) and Lack of time at training (5). Statements in the 'Lack of 11+ knowledge among coaches' cluster received the highest mean importance (3.67 out of 5) and feasibility for the Football Federation to address (3.20) rating. Statements in the 'Lack of facilities and resources' cluster received the lowest mean importance rating (2.23), while statements in the 'Lack of time at training' cluster received the lowest mean feasibility rating (2.19). CONCLUSIONS: A multistrategy, ecological approach to implementing the 11+-with specific attention paid to improving coach knowledge about the 11+ and how to implement it, linking the 11+ to the primary goal of soccer training, and organisational leadership-is required to improve the uptake of the 11+ among the targeted coaches.","2019","2020-05-20 00:12:27","2020-05-20 00:12:27","","244-251","","4","25","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/injuryprev-2017-042639; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628818447","epidemiology; female; human; soccer; sport injury; injury; adolescent; warm up; cluster analysis; accident prevention; attitude to health; physical education; health care planning; health promotion; professional practice; protocol compliance; Victoria","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design: Repeated measures, randomized order trials. Setting: Laboratory. Participants: Ten male professional soccer players. Main outcome measures: Reactive inversion, eversion and neutral hop tasks were completed at 15 min intervals during a soccer-specific protocol, with touchdown knee joint kinematics in the frontal and sagittal planes calculated at 200 Hz. In a separate trial, players completed maximal eccentric knee flexions at 160°·s−1 (reflecting average knee angular velocity in the functional task) at 15 min intervals, quantifying peak torque. Results: All trials were characterized by knee varus at touchdown, with ∼4° greater mal-alignment elicited over the final 15 min of the protocol (P ≤ 0.05). Peak eccentric hamstring strength was significantly (P = 0.045) reduced throughout the 2nd half. Conclusions: The coincident impairment of eccentric hamstring strength and increased knee varus at touchdown predisposes the player to injury, supporting epidemiological observations. Knee varus in these elite male players is in marked contrast to the valgus associated with ACL injury risk in female players.","2019","2020-05-20 00:12:28","2020-05-20 00:12:28","","21-26","","","37","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ptsp.2019.02.003; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2001653704","adult; human; male; article; elite athlete; soccer; sport injury; hamstring muscle; knee; clinical article; priority journal; controlled study; athlete; risk assessment; velocity; randomized controlled trial; muscle strength; prevalence; knee function; range of motion; knee injury; jumping; muscle injury; kinematics; quantitative analysis; torque; task performance; occupational exposure; disease predisposition; muscle isometric contraction; function test; functional assessment; muscle fatigue; controlled clinical trial; eccentric muscle contraction; functional status; health hazard; occupational health; varus knee","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: Retrospective matched cohort study of HS football players. Concussed athletes were matched to non-concussed athletes by grade and team and entered into the cohort at the same time as the concussed athlete was cleared. Subsequent LEIs were recorded as well as time to LEI. Fisher's exact test and t-test were used with a P-value set at 0.05 for significance. Results: A total of 269 rostered football players from 2 teams were identified between fall 2016 and fall 2018. Twenty-two players sustained a concussion and were matched to 22 non-concussed players. Rate of LEI was 22.7% (5/22) in the concussion group versus 13.6% (3/22) in the non-concussed group (P = 0.698). The relative risk of LEI for the concussion group was 1.41 (95% CI 0.55-3.63). Comparison of average time to LEI after concussion was 296 days (SD 201), while time to LEI from the matched group was 284 days (SD 173) with P-value of 0.47. Conclusions: Our pilot study potentially showed a clinical significance of increased LEI in concussed HS football athletes. A future study that includes 303 participants in each group(n = 606) would be powered to determine statistical significance based on this pilot study. Our goal for our future study is to provide a better understanding of this relationship to guide patient-centered decision-making regarding return to sport. Significance: There has been only one other study looking at the relationship of concussion and LEI in HS athletes.

An active learning educational activity (Concussion Bingo) was developed to assist in SRC identification. This study examined learning outcomes following the use of this activity by athletes in two US Title I (low socioeconomic status) high schools. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: High school sports. Methods: Participants (n = 102 athletes) completed 10-minute SRC knowledge of concussion surveys before and after participating in a Concussion Bingo activity. The 45-question survey assessed SRC knowledge through questions about SRC signs/symptoms, general injury information relating to loss of consciousness, the injured anatomical structure, complications of multiple SRCs and premature return to play. Participants had to mark key SRC terms on a Bingo card as they appeared throughout an SRC presentation including content from published consensus/position statements. Descriptive and parametric statistics were used to analyse the data. Results: Analysis of covariance revealed significant differences between pre- and post-Concussion Bingo scores. Athletes had the greatest knowledge increase of fogginess (n = 30, 29.5%), mood changes (n = 29, 28.5%), nausea (n = 27; 26.5%) and sleep problems (n = 27, 29.5%). On questions pertaining to the injury itself, athletes had the greatest increase on ‘you have to be hit in the head to get a concussion’ (n = 51, 50%), ‘what kind of an injury is a concussion’ (n = 31, 40.2%) and a concussion only occurs if you ‘black out’ (n = 24, 23.4%).

Our study reports the frequency of concussion across an entire, state-wide middle and high school sports program and relative risk based on sport type and gender. Methods: Retrospective analysis of all middle and high school student athletes ages 13 to 18 participating in 14 interscho-lastic sports who entered into the Hawaii Department of Education (HIDOE) concussion management program from academic year 2011 to 2012 through 2016 to 2017 using the online Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing (ImPACT) database. Results: Among 92 966 athletes participating in HHSAA sports over the 6 year study period, 5993 concussion injuries were identified (concussion risk = 6.4%, 95% CI: 4.81%-8.08%). The pooled concussion rate was 0.96 (95% CI: 0.94-0.99), higher than the rates reported for high school athletes in the current literature. The highest concussion rate over the 6 year study period occurred in girls' judo (1.92, 95% CI: 1.68-2.17), followed by football (1.60, 95% CI: 1.53-1.66). The pooled concussion rate for boys' sports (1.0, 95% CI: 0.97-1.03) was higher than girls' sports (0.91, 95% CI: 0.87-0.94), however in 4 of the 5 sports evaluated in which both girls and boys participated, girls had a higher rate of concussion injury than boys. Conclusions: Concussion injuries commonly occur in middle and high school sports programs. The likelihood of concussion among a given population of young student-athletes (ages 13-18) varies depending on the sport they are participating in, as well as gender of the athlete. Significance: Epidemiologic data on concussion adolescents is useful for accurately determining the relative risks of middle and high school sports participation and may be valuable in determining the appropriate allocation of health care and scholastic resources.","2019","2020-05-20 00:12:33","2020-05-20 00:12:33","","107","","2","29","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/JSM.0000000000000724; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629860273","conference abstract; female; human; male; football; controlled study; incidence; major clinical study; adolescent; concussion; gender; retrospective study; child; student athlete; risk factor; youth sport; high school student; judo; Hawaii","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Background 61% of retired football players report sustaining a concussion during their professional career. However, the influence of concussion history, career status and cumulative years played on total symptoms, symptom severity, neurocognitive function, and balance is largely unexplored. Design/Methods Elite football players (n = 102; age M = 27.75 ± 6.95 years) without a concussion (>30 days) underwent SCAT-3 assessments. Players were placed into a low (0-1) or multiple concussion (2+) history group and categorized by career status (draft prospects, active professional players and retired professional players). Data were analyzed using negative binomial regression and multiple linear regression analyses. Results 58.8% of players reported symptoms. Most common symptoms were fatigue (33.3%), trouble falling asleep (31.4%), difficulty remembering (29.4%), and difficulty concentrating (20.6%). Multiple concussions group reported 3.07 times greater total symptoms (p < 0.001), 3.58 times higher symptom severity (p < 0.001), and lower SAC scores (1.42 points) (p = 0.033) compared to low concussion group. Professionals reported 1.88 times greater total symptoms (p = .038) and 2.35 times higher symptom severity compared to draft prospects (p = 0.001). Retired players reported 7.07 times greater total symptoms (p < 0.001), 8.97 times higher symptom severity (p < 0.001), lower SAC scores (1.98 points) (p = 0.025), and 3.67 more m-BESS errors (p = 0.002), compared to draft prospects. Players with 11-19 years football exposure reported 3.83 times higher symptom severity compared to players with <11 years football exposure (p = 0.001). Players with >19 years football exposure had 6.87 times higher symptom severity than players with <11 years football exposure (p < .001).

PURPOSE: To comparatively examine the effects of SRC on athletes in Major League Soccer (MLS) and the English Premier League (EPL) in terms of incidence, return to play (RTP), performance, and career longevity. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: Contracts, transactions, injury reports, and performance statistics from 2008 to 2017 were obtained and cross-referenced across 6 publicly available websites detailing MLS and EPL data, including official league publications. For each league, players who sustained a concussion were compared with the 2008-2017 uninjured player pool. RTP and games missed were analyzed and compared. Career length was analyzed with Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Player performance changes were evaluated before and after concussion. RESULTS: Of the 1784 eligible MLS and 2001 eligible EPL players evaluated over the 10-year period, the incidence of publicly reported concussions per 1000 athlete-exposures was 20.22 and 18.68, respectively (P = .53). The incidence of reported concussions steadily increased in both leagues. MLS players missed a mean 7.3 games after concussion (37.0 days missed); EPL players missed a mean 0.6 games after concussion (10.9 days missed) (P < .0001, P < .0001). Statistical performance in terms of games started, assists, shots on goal, and total shots after concussion was significantly reduced at all nongoalie positions for players in the EPL; however, MLS nongoalie positions with concussion had no significant decreases in these categories. Goalies in both leagues had no significant change in performance or games started. The probability of playing a full season after concussion was not significantly decreased when compared with the uninjured pool in both leagues. CONCLUSION: This study established the SRC incidence among elite soccer players in 2 international professional leagues and identified major RTP and performance differences between EPL and MLS players. While career longevity was unaffected, the approach to managing concussion as in MLS may better promote player safety and preserve on-field performance.","2019","2020-05-20 00:12:36","2020-05-20 00:12:36","","2287-2293","","10","47","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0363546519859542; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628732185","human; article; soccer player; controlled study; incidence; season; cohort analysis; concussion; statistics; career; probability; Kaplan Meier method; longevity; publication","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Examinations of high school sport-related concussions need to be updated. This study describes the epidemiology of concussions in 20 high school sports during the 2013-2014 to 2017-2018 school years. METHODS: In this descriptive epidemiology study, a convenience sample of high school athletic trainers provided injury and athlete exposure (AE) data to the National High School Sports- Related Injury Surveillance Study (High School Reporting Information Online). Concussion rates per 10 000 AEs with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and distributions were calculated. Injury rate ratios and injury proportion ratios examined sex differences in sex-comparable sports (soccer, basketball, baseball and softball, cross country, track, and swimming). We also assessed temporal trends across the study period. RESULTS: Overall, 9542 concussions were reported for an overall rate of 4.17 per 10 000 AEs (95% CI: 4.09 to 4.26). Football had the highest concussion rate (10.40 per 10 000 AEs). Across the study period, football competition-related concussion rates increased (33.19 to 39.07 per 10 000 AEs); practice-related concussion rates decreased (5.47 to 4.44 per 10 000 AEs). In all sports, recurrent concussion rates decreased (0.47 to 0.28 per 10 000 AEs). Among sex-comparable sports, concussion rates were higher in girls than in boys (3.35 vs 1.51 per 10 000 AEs; injury rate ratio = 2.22; 95% CI: 2.07 to 2.39). Also, among sex-comparable sports, girls had larger proportions of concussions that were recurrent than boys did (9.3% vs 6.4%; injury proportion ratio = 1.44; 95% CI: 1.11 to 1.88). CONCLUSIONS: Rates of football practice-related concussions and recurrent concussions across all sports decreased. Changes in concussion rates may be associated with changes in concussion incidence, diagnosis, and management. Future research should continue to monitor trends and examine the effect of prevention strategies.","2019","2020-05-20 00:12:37","2020-05-20 00:12:37","","","","5","144","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1542/peds.2019-2180; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2004336671","female; human; male; article; soccer; basketball; priority journal; incidence; major clinical study; sport; concussion; high school; sex difference; swimming; track and field; baseball; softball; trend study; athletic trainer; descriptive research; exposure","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Study design: We conducted a prospective cohort study over 2 years collecting data during two 10-week fall seasons. Youth with concussion were followed to determine time to return to school, sport, and baseline level of symptoms. Logistic regression was used to estimate the risk of sustaining a concussion associated with baseline demographic factors. Time to return to school, sport, and baseline symptoms were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Results: Of 863 youth followed (996 player-seasons), 51 sustained a football-related concussion, for an athlete-level incidence of 5.1% per season. Youth with history of concussion had a 2-fold increased risk for sustaining an incident concussion (OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.1-4.8). Youth with depression had a 5-fold increased risk of concussion (OR, 5.6; 95% CI, 1.7-18.8). After a concussion, 50% of athletes returned to school by 3 days, 50% returned to sport by 13 days, and 50% returned to a baseline level of symptoms by 3 weeks. Conclusions: Concussion rates in this study were slightly higher than previously reported, with 5 of every 100 youth sustaining a football-related concussion each season. One-half of youth were still symptomatic 3 weeks after injury.

Our hypothesis was that risk for concussion would be higher during predicted circadian «red zones” (biological afternoon) compared to optimal zones of circadian regulated alertness in the late morning and night games under the two-process model of sleep regulation. We also hypothesized that circadian regulation of risk for concussion would be independent of implementing a concussion assessment and return-to-play protocol. Methods: To support our hypotheses, we examined timestamps of concussions (based on each team's biological (not actual) time) across the regular season pre-implementation of the NFL concussion protocol (2013) and post-implementation (2015). Results: There were 140 documented concussions across the 2013 regular season prior to implementation of the NFL concussion protocol. In 2015, there were 218 documented concussions after implementation of the NFL concussion protocol. Despite implementation of the NFL concussion protocol, we discovered that the biological afternoon was a danger zone for concussions. In 2013, 75% of concussions (103/140) occurred during the biological afternoon. In 2015, this number increased to 82% (177/218) during the early biological afternoon. Conclusion: Moreover, time of day matters for concussion risk management. These data are sufficient and necessary for developing effective countermeasures to reduce risks for shortterm and chronic head injuries (CTE) in professional football players.","2019","2020-05-20 00:12:39","2020-05-20 00:12:39","","A71","","","42","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L627914364; http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/sleep/zsz067.172","conference abstract; football player; human; controlled study; season; concussion; risk assessment; head injury; biological product; alertness; night; process model; risk management; sleep","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The cultivation of campus football talents plays a key role in the rapid and healthy development of campus football. Performing the campus football talents education in university is important for the consolidate the foundation of campus football talents team. Therefore, cultivation of the inter-disciplinary talents for campus football work needs to be analyzed in detail according the performance evaluation modal, which can thoroughly present the methods and effects of cultivation, and show the results of quality. In this present study, in order to achieve the prospect and goals of promoting the campus football teacher training and assessment system to the talents cultivation in the university, a performance evaluation modal for the campus football talents was constructed, which will helpful and service for the national health that promoted by campus football. Methods: The performance evaluation contents and methods in the sports field were sorted and summarized following the previous references. The experts' opinions were evaluated using Delphi Method, including arrangement the modal structure and screening the indexes. At last, we also analyzed and deduced the problems and performance evaluation in the cultivation of campus football talents using analysis and induction. Results: 1. The performance evaluation scope of campus football calculation is the professional persons who can undertake campus football service and obtain practical results in the work. 2. Four first-level indexes of performance evaluation modal was identified from the goal of campus football talents calculation, including concept evaluation, social requirement assessment, professional competence evaluation and service effect evaluation systems. 3. Analytic hierarchy process was used to determine the specific content of each first-level index. The content and index of second-level index were identified using fuzzy matrix computation and consistency check. The second-level indexes are working concept, educational function and security concept. Second-level indexes under the social requirement assessment are personnel demand, running target and development requirement. Second-level indexes under the professional competence evaluation are teaching ability, competition training organizational skills and cultural construction capacity. Second-level indexes under the service effect evaluation are scale, quality and direct benefit. Conclusions: The performance index of cultivation Chinese campus football talent points out the direction for the cultivation of football talents in colleges and universities. Except of the professional competence and service effectiveness, both of the concepts and social requirement should be evaluated in the cultivation of campus football talents. Moreover, the performance index modal of cultivation Chinese campus football talent needs to be adjusted and optimized in the practice development, and further constructed the third-level index system. Meanwhile, it can be combined with qualitative and quantitative study to continuously enrich the methods and results of campus football talents cultivation. .","2019","2020-05-20 00:12:43","2020-05-20 00:12:43","","215","","SUPPL, 9","125","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bcpt.13269; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L631567226","adult; conference abstract; female; human; human experiment; male; public health; football; calculation; competition; running; teaching; skill; quantitative analysis; Delphi study; professional competence; teacher training","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"SD2KSPJ6","journalArticle","2019","Kościołek, Szczepan","Consumer loyalty among fans of sports clubs: How much do they vary across disciplines?","Baltic Journal of Health & Physical Activity","","20801297","","","Background: In the sports sector, the expected outcome of having loyal fans is equated with the amount and frequency of game attendance, the purchase of team merchandise, following the club's results in the media, and participation in discussions about the club, whereas the level of loyalty is determined by team identification and customer satisfaction with the team's performance. However, previous studies have not investigated the differentiation of the loyalty of club fans across different sports disciplines. To fill this research gap, the goals of the study were to measure the difference in loyalty behaviors in sports club fans and their determinants across disciplines and to find whether the discipline can affect the general level of loyalty despite other determinants. Material and methods: The study was conducted in the form of an online survey (n = 1349) spread with the use of commercial advertisements in social media. Results: Football and speedway fans have higher levels of identification and consumption behaviors than fans of clubs belonging to other sports disciplines. Contrary to expectations, satisfaction with a team's performance made no significant difference among sport fans concerning match attendance and interest-in-media, and it had limited impact on merchandise purchasing. Conclusions: This study supports evidence from previous observations indicating the leading role of identification in enhancing loyalty behaviors among sports fans. The combination of findings provides some support for the conceptual premise that loyalty behaviors and their determining factors are varied across sports disciplines.

However, the association of CAA with repetitive head impacts (RHI) and with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is unknown. We evaluated the relationship between RHI from contact sport participation, CTE, and CAA within a group of deceased contact sport athletes (n = 357), a community-based cohort (n = 209), and an AD cohort from Boston University AD Center (n = 241). Unsupervised hierarchal cluster analysis demonstrated a unique cluster (n = 11) with increased CAA in the leptomeningeal vessels compared to the intracortical vessels (p < 0.001) comprised of participants with significantly greater frequencies of CTE (7/11) and history of RHI. Overall, participants with CTE (n = 251) had more prevalent (p < 0.001) and severe (p = 0.010) CAA within the frontal leptomeningeal vessels compared to intracortical vessels. Compared to those with AD, participants with CTE had more severe CAA in frontal than parietal lobes (p < 0.001) and more severe CAA in leptomeningeal than intracortical vessels (p = 0.002). The overall frequency of CAA in participants with CTE was low, and there was no significant association between contact sport participation and the presence of CAA. However, in those with CAA, a history of contact sports was associated with increased CAA severity in the frontal leptomeningeal vessels (OR = 4.01, 95% CI 2.52–6.38, p < 0.001) adjusting for AD, APOE ε4 status, and age. Participants with CAA had increased levels of sulcal tau pathology and decreased levels of the synaptic marker PSD-95 (p’s < 0.05), and CAA was a predictor of dementia (OR = 1.75, 95% CI 1.02–2.99, p = 0.043) adjusting for age, sex, and comorbid pathology. Overall, contact sport participation and CTE were associated with more severe frontal and leptomeningeal CAA, and CAA was independently associated with worse pathological and clinical outcomes.","2019","2020-05-20 00:12:45","2020-05-20 00:12:45","","401-413","","3","138","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628144652; http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00401-019-02031-x","female; human; male; article; priority journal; major clinical study; cohort analysis; disease severity; cluster analysis; clinical assessment; human tissue; genotype; disease association; aged; contact sport; chronic traumatic encephalopathy; neuropathology; dementia; vascular amyloidosis; sports and sport related phenomena; apolipoprotein E; diffuse Lewy body disease; DSM-IV; parietal lobe; repetitive head impact; SAP90/PSD95 associated protein","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: The National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) was searched for football, basketball, soccer, lacrosse and ice hockey related facial injuries. Cross-sectional analysis of incidence, age, and sex and specific injury diagnoses, mechanisms, and facial locations were performed. We focused on craniofacial and soft tissue injuries and excluded patients with concussion or other neurological injuries. Results: A total of 24,905 cases were identified in the NEISS database, corresponding to an estimated, 764,293 emergency department visits. The most hazardous sports were basketball, accounting for 356,188 visits (46.6%), football with 249,633 visits (32.6%), and soccer with 128,113 (14.7%) visits. Lacrosse and ice hockey accounted for 16,869 (1.9%) and 13,490 (1.5%) visits, respectively.

Training load was quantified using a 10-Hz global positioning system with integrated 100-Hz accelerometer and heart rate recordings over a 3-month competitive period. Total distance (TD) covered and high-speed running (HSR, >16 km·h) during training were higher in the week after playing against a bottom-level or top-level opponent compared to a medium-level opponent (p < 0.05; effect size [ES] = 0.30-1.04). TD was also higher when preparing for a match against a bottom-level opponent (p < 0.05; ES = 0.39-0.76). In addition, the percentage of HSR was higher after playing a bottom-level compared to a medium-level opponent (p < 0.001; ES = 0.49 [0.27; 0.71]). TD covered was higher in the week following a draw or a win, and higher before a loss compared to a draw (p < 0.05, ES = 0.32-0.81). Both absolute HSR and HSR expressed as percentage of TD were higher before losing and winning a match compared to a draw (p < 0.05; ES = 0.72-0.98). Weekly TL seems to be slightly affected by match-related contextual variables, with special emphasis on the opponent standard and match outcome. Higher training volume was observed before and after playing against a top-level opponent, and after losing a match, whereas the volume of high-intensity training seems to be higher when preparing for a game against a top-level opponent.

Each player performed 6 trials of the CUT task whereby three-dimensional motion data from 10 Qualisys proreflex cameras (240 Hz) and ground reaction forces from 2 Advanced Mechanical Technology, Inc. force platforms (1,200 Hz) were collected. Relative eccentric knee extensor (ECC-KE) and flexor peak moments (ECC-KF) were collected from both limbs at 60°·s using a Kin-Com isokinetic dynamometer. Hierarchical multiple regression revealed that minimum center of mass (CM) and approach velocities (CM velocity at touchdown of penultimate foot contact) could explain 82% (79% adjusted) of the variation in CUT completion time (F(1,16) = 36.086, p < 0.0001). ECC-KE was significantly (p < 0.05) moderately associated (R ≥ 0.610) with velocities at key instances during the CUT. High (upper 50th percentile) ECC-KE individuals (n = 9) had significantly (p ≤ 0.01; d ≥ 1.34) greater velocities at key instances during the CUT. The findings suggest that individuals with higher ECC-KE produce faster CUT performance, by approaching with greater velocity and maintaining a higher velocity during penultimate and final contact, as they are better able to tolerate the larger loads associated with a faster approach.","2019","2020-05-20 00:12:49","2020-05-20 00:12:49","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1519/JSC.0000000000003433; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L630059929","adult; female; human; human experiment; article; soccer player; knee; clinical article; young adult; velocity; dynamometer; foot; ground reaction force; task performance; Englishman; multiple regression","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Fifteen male experienced university players kicked a soccer ball placed at four height conditions (0, 25, 50 and 75 cm). Their kicking motion was captured at 500 Hz. The effectiveness of lower body segment rotations in producing forward (Ffv) and upward (Fuv) foot velocity were computed and time integrated. Major contributors for Ffv were a) left hip linear velocity, b) knee extension and c) pelvis retroflexion (the pitch rotation). The contribution of a) become smaller as the ball height increased while those of b) and c) did not change significantly. Moreover, the pelvis clockwise rotation (the yaw rotation) showed apparent contribution only for volley kicking (except 0 cm height). Major contributors for Fuv were 1) knee flexion, 2) hip internal rotation, 3) pelvis clockwise rotation (the roll rotation) and 4) hip flexion. The contributions of 1) and 4) become consistently smaller as the ball height increased, while those of 2) and 3) become larger systematically. Soccer volley kicking was found to have unique adaptations of segmental contributions to achieve higher foot position while maintain foot forward velocity.","2019","2020-05-20 00:12:50","2020-05-20 00:12:50","","1-16","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14763141.2019.1667422; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629957723","adult; human; male; article; soccer; hip; knee function; rotation; pitch; foot; pelvis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, these programmes require appropriate implementation support. This study evaluated implementation activity outcomes associated with the implementation of FootyFirst, an exercise training injury prevention programme for community Australian football, both with (FootyFirst+S) and without (FootyFirst+NS) implementation support. METHOD: An evaluation plan based on the Reach Effectiveness Adoption Implementation Maintenance (RE-AIM) Sports Setting Matrix was applied in a controlled ecological evaluation of the implementation of FootyFirst. RE-AIM dimension-specific (range: 0-2) and total RE-AIM scores (range: 0-10) were derived by triangulating data from a number of sources (including surveys, interviews, direct observations and notes) describing FootyFirst implementation activities. The mean dimension-specific and total scores were compared for clubs in regions receiving FootyFirst+S and FootyFirst+NS, through analysis of variance. RESULTS: The mean total RE-AIM score forclubs in the FootyFirst+S regions was 2.4 times higher than for clubs in the FootyFirst+NS region (4.73 vs 1.94; 95% CI for the difference: 1.64 to 3.74). Similarly, all dimension-specific scores were significantly higher for clubs in the FootyFirst+S regions compared with clubs in the FootyFirst+NS region. In all regions, the dimension-specific scores were highest for reach and adoption, and lowest for implementation. CONCLUSION: Implementing exercise training injury prevention programmes in community sport is challenging. Delivering programme content supported by a context-specific and evidence-informed implementation plan leads to greater implementation activity, which is an important precursor to injury reductions.","2019","2020-05-20 00:12:51","2020-05-20 00:12:51","","480-486","","6","25","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/injuryprev-2017-042579; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629927579","article; football; lower limb; sport injury; exercise; controlled study; analysis of variance; outcome assessment; accident prevention; prevention; interview; adoption; behavior change; comparative effectiveness","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) to estimate regional brain strains instantly and accurately by conceptualizing head rotational velocity profiles as two-dimensional images for input. We use two impact datasets with augmentation to investigate the CNN prediction performances with a variety of training-testing configurations. Three strain measures are considered, including maximum principal strain (MPS) of the whole brain, MPS of the corpus callosum, and fiber strain of the corpus callosum. The CNN is further tested using an independent impact dataset (N = 314) measured in American football. Based on 2592 training samples, it achieves a testing R2 of 0.916 and root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.014 for MPS of the whole brain. Combining all impact-strain response data available (N = 3069), the CNN achieves an R2 of 0.966 and RMSE of 0.013 in a 10-fold cross-validation. This technique may enable a clinical diagnostic capability to a sophisticated head injury model, such as facilitating head impact sensors in concussion detection via a mobile device. In addition, it may transform current acceleration-based injury studies into focusing on regional brain strains. The trained CNN is publicly available along with associated code and examples at https://github.com/Jilab-biomechanics/CNN-brain-strains. They will be updated as needed in the future.","2019","2020-05-20 00:12:52","2020-05-20 00:12:52","","17326","","1","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629949364; http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-53551-1","article; football; acceleration; biomechanics; controlled study; concussion; prediction; head injury; sensor; nonhuman; animal experiment; animal model; convolutional neural network; corpus callosum","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The former mainly concern the applied technical aspect of the game, while the latter focus more on the conditional abilities associated with the game (strength, endurance and speed), biomechanics and energy recruitment mechanisms. As for the executive part, the qualitative aspects require a good degree of development of the technical-coordinative capacities, which are divided into literature in special coordination capacities and general coordination skills. In this study we will see how coordination is a component strongly linked to football, but above all to its qualitative aspects, through tests administered to a group of young soccer players.

The symptoms were recognized by an on-site certified athletic trainer who activated emergency medical response. After unremarkable initial emergency evaluation, referral to a sports cardiologist unveiled an anomalous left coronary artery arising from the right coronary sinus on echocardiogram. After surgical correction and rehabilitation, the patient was able to return to exercise activity. Anomalous coronary arteries are the second most common cause of autopsy-positive episodes of sudden cardiac death among athletes and are rarely recognized with abnormal electrocardiogram (EKG) findings prior to events. This case highlights the importance of prompt recognition, evaluation, and treatment of athletes with cardiac symptoms, and contributes to an ongoing discussion on whether echocardiograms should be considered in preparticipation evaluations.

Despite the numerous available data on adult elite athletes' cardiac parameters, there is considerably less information on youth athletes. Our goal was to determine physiological cardiac adaptation in young competitive athletes and to determine the relationship between cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) parameters and clinical and spiroergometry data. Methods: Analysing the morphological and functional parameters by CMR and spiroergometry, we comprehensively studied the degree and quality of cardiac adaptation in asymptomatic young athletes (n = 84; 68 male; 16.6 ± 2.3 ys; 13.1 ± 6.5 training hours/week) performing sports with high dynamic component (football n = 48, water polo n = 22, swimming n = 14) and healthy non-athletes (n = 30; 17 male; 18,4 ys, <5 training hours/week). Using CMR we evaluated left (LV) and right ventricular (RV) ejection fraction (EF), body surface area related enddiastolic (EDVi), end-systolic (ESVi), stroke volume (SVi) and mass (Mi). Maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) as a generally accepted indicator of endurance capacity was assessed using spiroergometry. Results: Compared to the non-athlete group, young athletes showed significantly higher LVEDVi (109.6 ± 13.4 vs 92.3 ± 9.4 ml/m2), RVEDVi (110.1 ± 15.3 vs 94.1 ± 10.9 ml/m2), LVSVi (65.2 ± 8.9 vs 54.4 ± 7.3 ml/m2), RVSVi (63.6 ± 9.1 vs 53.4 ml/m2), LVMi (70.0 ± 11.0 vs 48.9 ± 9.4 g/m2) and VO2max (3.7 ± 0.8 vs 3.1 ± 0.8 l/min). VO2max showed a positive correlation with LVEDVi (p < 0.0001; r = 0.41), RVEDVi (p < 0.0001; r = 0.41) and LVMi (p < 0.0001; r = 0.56), RVMi (p < 0.01; r = 0.34). Analyzing age, gender, training hours/week and sports type gender and training hours/week seemed to be an independent predictor of elevated LVEDVi (p < 0.05 beta=-0,31; p < 0.01 beta = 0.65), elevated RVEDVi (p < 0.01 beta=-0.35; p < 0.05 beta = 0.50) and elevated LVMi (p < 0.0001 beta=-0.677, p < 0.0001 beta = 0.67). Conclusion: In young athletes gender and training hours seem to be an independent predictor of morphological changes called athlete's heart. In youth competitive athletes an apparent correlation was found between spiroergometry and CMR data. Imbalance between morphological and functional adaptation may raise the suspicion of an underlying pathology.","2019","2020-05-20 00:12:58","2020-05-20 00:12:58","","i778","","","20","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ehjci/jey250; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L630838004","adult; conference abstract; female; human; male; football; aerobic capacity; controlled study; major clinical study; athlete; gender; juvenile; endurance; swimming; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; body surface; water polo; heart right ventricle ejection fraction; heart stroke volume","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: Prospective cohort study in NCAA Division I athletes. Baseline limb symmetry index (LSI) ratios were calculated for isokinetic strength at 60 and 180 degrees for knee flexion, knee extension, hip adduction and hip abduction. Injury data were collected by ATCs. Analysis was done to assess the effect of LSI on injury occurrence, number of injuries and time to return to sport after injury (tRTS). Results: (1000). Results: Seventy-two athletes (women's lacrosse n = 24, men's basketball n = 13, women's basketball n = 10 and women's soccer n = 25) completed bilateral strength assessments. Sixty-one athletes (84.7%) reported 148 injuries with a mean of 2.0 (61.5) per athlete. The average tRTS was 5.3 (616) days. There were no significant differences between LSI ratios and injury occurrence. The only significant difference between LSI ratios and number of injuries was for knee flexion at 180°s (P=0.045). Additionally, there was a significant difference between tRTS (0 vs 11 days) and LSI ratio for knee extension at 60°/s (0 days: 87.5 ± 9.9; 11 days: 82.6 ± 14.3; P = 0.02). Conclusions: With few exceptions that may not be clinically significant, preseason lower extremity isokinetic strength asymmetries did not correlate to lower extremity injuries or time loss. Limb strength symmetry is often used as a determinate for return to sport after an injury but if it cannot predict injury, it may not be useful in guiding return to sport either. Significance: This study suggests that focuses in rehabilitation and injury prevention should shift from isolated strength measures to other measures of neuromuscular control, such as movement patterns.","2019","2020-05-20 00:13:00","2020-05-20 00:13:00","","101-102","","2","29","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/JSM.0000000000000724; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629860131","adult; conference abstract; human; soccer; hip; basketball; controlled study; major clinical study; prospective study; return to sport; athlete; cohort analysis; abduction; adduction; knee function; accident prevention; leg injury; neuromuscular function","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of this study is to highlight the importance of education in the behaviour of athletes practicing performance sports. Ethics in sport means everything related to an athlete's behaviour during competitions and in social life and it reflects in the fair play attitude of athletes. Fair play does not entail only the observance of play rules, but it transcribes the attitude an athlete must have: respect for the opponent and the preservation of his physical and mental integrity, respect for the team-mates, for coaches, supporters, etc. An athlete will behave according to the spirit of fair play when he thinks about the others, too. Fair play is not only an ethical behaviour or a fortuitous behaviour; it represents an entire code of morals, a psychology, a code of unwritten laws. Methods. Our research comprised 60 athletes practicing individual and collective sports (track and field, handball, rugby, soccer, volleyball) and whose behaviour was observed throughout a competitive year. The research methods used within our study were the literature review method, the observation method, the investigation method, the statistical-mathematical method. In order to highlight the relevance of education in the manifestation of fair play, we have used The Fair Play Questionnaire that had the purpose of measuring the way athletes think and act during competitions and in social life. The questionnaire includes 28 items structured on two subscales of 14 items each: fair play in competitions and fair play in society. Results. Subscales may be used both separately (each subscale individually) and combined in a total score. The hypothesis is confirmed for all the three dimensions. The ANOVA value obtained for fair play in competitions is F = 3.525, significant for the threshold p ≤ 0.05 (p = 0.017), for fair play in society is F = 4.141, significant for the threshold p ≤ 0.05 (p = 0.008), while for general fair play is F = 4.556, significant for the threshold p ≤ 0.05 (p = 0.004) (Table 3). Consequently, there are statistically significant differences between the groups by the variable of education level. Conclusions. The analysis conducted has confirmed that the level of education is important and that it influences the fair play behaviour of athletes both in competitions and in society.

All tests were performed on the force platform. Significantly (P<0.001) improved jump height was evident in the MMA fighters and professional soccer players (37.7 ± 7.4 cm and 41.6 ± 6.1 cm, respectively) in relation to the rugby and the control groups (30.4 ± 4.6 cm and 28.6 ± 3.6 cm, respectively). Pearson's analysis demonstrated that jump height was significantly correlated with push-off and landing phases in the MMA fighters, but not with the rugby athletes, the professional soccer players, and the control group. Soccer players and MMA fighters showed greater jump height than the Rugby players and the control subjects, with the fighters relying more on push off forces to achieve peak power output, while soccer players used other neuromuscular characteristics.

Methods: A single-blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover design was adopted to test eight male elite soccer players during HIIT sessions under two conditions: after placebo supplementation and after Cr supplementation. HIIT test sessions consisted of an intermittent test (five bouts of running) with a constant load applied until exhaustion was reached. The vertical component of ground reaction force and electromyography data were recorded by Gaitway and Lynx-EMG Systems, respectively. Heart rate, rated perceived exertion (Borg's Scale) and lactate concentration information were also obtained. Results: Cr supplementation did not affect heart rate, rated perceived exertion, and lactate concentration. Decreased values of magnitude of the first peak of the vertical component of ground reaction force (17.2–24.2%) and impulse of the first 50 ms (Imp50; 34.3%) were observed for Cr, but higher values of time to reach the first peak were detected for Cr compared with placebo. Significant modifications in muscle activation were also observed, mainly in the pre-activation phase, and changes were observed in intermediary bouts. Conclusions: Cr supplementation has the potential to influence biomechanical parameters related to impact control during a single session of HIIT based on running. In particular, the findings of the current study indicate possible improvements in shock attenuation and a safer practice of HIIT under Cr supplementation.","2019","2020-05-20 00:13:03","2020-05-20 00:13:03","","99-104","","","61","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2018.09.020; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2001507919","human; male; article; soccer player; biomechanics; heart rate; priority journal; controlled study; scoring system; adolescent; running; muscle contraction; high intensity interval training; exhaustion; lactic acid; lactate blood level; ground reaction force; electromyography; crossover procedure; Borg Scale; creatine; diet supplementation; shock; single blind procedure","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

M.; Vaeyens, Roel; Fransen, Job","Creating a framework for talent identification and development in emerging football nations","Science & Medicine in Football","","24734446","","","Talent identification and development in football is a complex, multifaceted process. Currently, most of the research in this domain is conducted in highly ranked, established football nations where the sport is immensely popular (e.g. Germany, Portugal, Belgium, etc.). Whilst these nation's data are informative to some degree, there is little conclusive evidence supporting the effectiveness of traditional talent identification approaches. Typically, talent identification involves actively selecting promising players with early performance superiorities without considering the changes that can occur during development. Consequently, it is difficult to develop a framework for emerging football nations as the repercussions of adopting traditional approaches to talent identification are likely greater due to differences the size of the talent pool, accessibility of systematic training environments, and availability of financial and logistical resources. It is proposed that emerging football nations should focus on: preventing active deselection and dropout to maximise the size of the talent pool, mitigating the influence of confounding factors on talent identification, and longitudinally tracking players throughout development to document the performance profiles that lead to football expertise. Collectively, these strategies can reduce the reliance on identifying players based on early performance superiorities and focus on holistic, long-term development.

Tactical differences between Spanish La Liga, English Premier League, German Bundesliga and Italian Serie A","International Journal of Performance Analysis in Sport","","14748185","","","The aim of the present study was to compare how goal scoring opportunities emerge in the top four European soccer leagues. The sample included 914 team possessions that led to the creation of goal scoring opportunities in open play situations from 80 random matches (20 = Spanish La Liga (SLL); 20 = English Premier League (EPL); 20 = German Bundelisga (GB); 20 = Italian Serie A (ISA)) during 2017–2018 season. A total of 8 tactical dimensions related to the start, development and the end of the team possessions were evaluted by means of multidimensional observation. Kruskal Wallis analyses revealed significant tactical differences between the 4 competitions. SLL showed a greater proportion of long and combinative attacks. EPL had a higher tendency of progressing by means of fast and directs attacks. GB had the greatest number of counter-attacks, and ISA had the shortest offensive sequences and more proportion of counter-attacks and direct attacks than combinative and fast attacks. These results provide important insights to coaches and sporting directors to understand the different tactical requirements of each competition and manage the club's strategies regarding tactical model, player recruitment and youth development.

Study design: The study utilised a Kaupapa Māori case study approach and indigenous forms of storytelling (pūrākau, whakataukī) to encourage participants to share their narratives and experiences of how the inclusion of Māori knowledge in a team context influenced their sense of identity and leadership and thus well-being on and off the field. Methods: Semi-structured, one-on-one, interviews alongside focus group discussions generated the data (narratives) collected. Data were thematically analysed, utilising aspects of an indigenous model of Health Promotion known as Te Pae Māhutonga. Specifically, the cultural identity affirmation (Mauri Ora) and leadership (Ngā Manukura) elements were illustrated as these were applicable to high performance sport contexts. Results: Analysis revealed that the team narrative, values and expectations were enhanced by embracing Māori stories (pūrākau) and symbols. In particular, this enhanced the cultural identity, sense of belonging, leadership and well-being of a number of team members on and off-field. Neither the players nor coaches disclosed any negative impacts to their well-being from incorporating indigenous storytelling (pūrākau, whakataukī) into their team building practices and culture. Conclusions: Sport-related research and practices that are informed by indigenous knowledge and values can benefit the well-being of indigenous people (in this case Māori), collectives (rugby team) and individuals (researchers, players and coaches). Further research exploring how indigenous knowledge is integrated into sport-related contexts is needed to understand whether the well-being of a wider range of teams and individuals (women, non-indigenous) may benefit from the inclusion of indigenous knowledge, values and practices.","2019","2020-05-20 00:13:09","2020-05-20 00:13:09","","68-76","","","176","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2018.12.010; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2001545345","adult; female; human; male; article; rugby; ethnicity; expectation; scientist; leadership; identity; interview; wellbeing; New Zealand; health promotion; indigenous people; narrative; storytelling; team building","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This case highlights the importance of recognizing high-risk mechanisms for cervical spine injury, and specifically the danger of spear tackling among football players at all levels.Case Report: A 16-year-old male high school football player presented to the pediatric emergency department for a neck injury sustained after spear tackling during a football game. He had no neurologic symptoms and met the NEXUS criteria for omitting x-ray evaluation. However, the description of spear tackling as the mechanism of injury led to the ordering of cervical radiographs, which revealed a C5 fracture. The patient was ultimately taken to the operating room for internal fixation, with a final surgical diagnosis of a C5 teardrop fracture. On outpatient follow-up at 1 year, the patient has had no neurologic sequelae. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: This case serves as a reminder that all evaluations of trauma patients should begin with an attempt to determine, as precisely as possible, the mechanism that was in play at the time of injury. The reassurance provided by a normal physical examination may be misleading. Spear tackling is not an uncommonly encountered cause of injury in American football, despite the practice being prohibited since a rule change in 1976. Continued education and increased awareness of the association of axial load injury with spear tackling may make it possible to avoid missing a potentially devastating cervical spine injury.","2019","2020-05-20 00:13:13","2020-05-20 00:13:13","","185-190","","2","56","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","","","","https://gateway.library.qut.edu.au/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=c8h&AN=134573281&site=ehost-live&scope=site","Male; Football; Adolescence; Athletes; Cervical Cord; Cervical Cord -- Injuries; Decision Support Techniques; Fractures; Fractures -- Diagnosis; Physical Examination -- Methods; Radiography -- Methods; Risk Factors; Weight-Bearing -- Physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

PURPOSE: To demonstrate the efficacy of incorporating targeted football drills into a team's practice routine with the goal of improving players' technique and reduce exposure to subconcussive head impacts. METHODS: Seventy high school football players (age, 16.4 ± 1.1 yr) were tested PRE season using a sport-specific functional assessment. Results from the testing were used to inform the design of a prepractice intervention aimed at improving tackling and blocking techniques while reducing exposure to head impacts. The assessment included drills which evaluated the players' ability to safely tackle, and block while simulating game-like situations. Testing was repeated at MID season (internal control) without an intervention, and again at POST season (experimental), after introduction of the prepractice intervention between these timepoints, administered twice weekly. All testing sessions were recorded, and subsequently reviewed by trained graders based on selected criteria defined by football coaches. A subset of 19 participants wore in-helmet accelerometers to assess the effectiveness of the intervention in decreasing head impacts during practice. RESULTS: Significant improvements in blocking and tackling techniques were observed after the introduction of the intervention (P < 0.0001). Participating athletes also showed better techniques when evaluated in new game-like situations, postseason, providing evidence for proper acquisition and generalizability of these safer habits. Finally, frequency of head impacts (>15g) per practice was significantly reduced by ~30% after 1 month of training. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that data-informed methods can be used to improve coaching practices and promote safer play, which can have a positive public health impact moving forward.","2019","2020-05-20 00:13:16","2020-05-20 00:13:16","","2366-2374","","11","51","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1249/MSS.0000000000002046; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628624456","adult; female; human; human experiment; male; public health; article; football; clinical article; season; accelerometer; athlete; helmet; comparative effectiveness; habit","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet current training methods that simulate the refereeing task are limited. Skilled soccer referees (N = 22, M age = 27.14 years, SD = 6.40) were tested on a new decision-making simulator during the active part of the season. They ran on a treadmill for 60 min at varying paces while watching two video sections depicting real matches, in context and in mixed order, and called their match decisions out loud. They completed pre- and post-test assessments of their feelings and perceived exertion, and a post-test assessment of their performance. The referees reported positive feelings prior to and following the test, and rated their performance favourably. They felt the simulator was moderately representative of a real match, and their perceived exertion increased progressively during the test. Decision accuracy levels were higher for simple decisions, such as out of play (73.81%), than for careless fouls (62.86%) or yellow/red cards (25.97%). Decision accuracy levels for yellow/red cards decisions were significantly higher in the in-context section (28.91%) than in the mixed section (20.83%). Decision accuracy levels peaked in the third quarter and decreased during the final quarter. Self-control during the test correlated moderately with overall accuracy. Careless foul decision accuracy was on par with previous studies, supporting the simulator's validity. The findings support the use of the simulator as a potentially innovative method for training referees in sequential decision-making.

To analyse how the quality of opposition, match location, and match status affect the positioning of the team during ball recovery. Methods. Overall, 510 ball recovery situations from a professional soccer team were analysed with a tracking system (AmiscoPro). Five compound positional variables (team compactness [TC ], compactness behind ball location [CB ], compactness forward ball location [CF], team width [TW], and game centre index [GC]) and three situational variables (match location, quality of opposition, and match status) were considered in this study. Data were examined with the use of a linear regression model. Results. The GC was reduced by 1.391 meters (p < 0.05) and TW was advanced by 2.204 meters (p < 0.05) when the team was winning and losing, respectively, as compared with when the scores were even. Playing against strong opposition increased CF by 3.055 meters (p < 0.05). No effects were detected on TC or CB. Conclusions. The team modifies the tactics as a consequence of the match conditions. Different field positions emerge in relation with situational variables. This information can be used to better understand the positional behaviour during ball recovery.

More recently, the organization of football teams and their performance have been unveiled using metrics coming from Network Science, where a team is considered as a complex network whose nodes (i.e., players) interact with the aim of overcoming the opponent network. Here, we combine the use of different network metrics to extract the particular signature of the F.C. Barcelona coached by Guardiola, which has been considered one of the best teams along football history. We have first compared the network organization of Guardiola's team with their opponents along one season of the Spanish national league, identifying those metrics with statistically significant differences and relating them with the Guardiola's game. Next, we have focused on the temporal nature of football passing networks and calculated the evolution of all network properties along a match, instead of considering their average. In this way, we are able to identify those network metrics that enhance the probability of scoring/receiving a goal, showing that not all teams behave in the same way and how the organization Guardiola's F.C. Barcelona is different from the rest, including its clustering coefficient, shortest-path length, largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix, algebraic connectivity and centrality distribution.","2019","2020-05-20 00:13:21","2020-05-20 00:13:21","","13602","","1","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629382810; http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-49969-2","human; article; football; season; probability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DESIGN: Descriptive Epidemiology Study. SETTING: Cardiac assessments incorporating clinical examination, 12-lead ECG, echocardiography, and health questionnaire. PARTICIPANTS: Soccer players at 5 professional clubs in England, the United Kingdom. INTERVENTION: Data was retrospectively collected, inspected, and analyzed to determine their clinical management and subsequent follow-up. RESULTS: Over 2 years, 265 soccer players, aged 13 to 37 years with 66% of white European ethnicity, were included in the cohort. Eleven percent had ""not-normal"" assessments, of these assessments, 83% were considered gray screens, falling into three broad categories: structural cardiac features (including valvular abnormalities), functional cardiac features, and electrocardiogram changes. After cardiology consultation, all assessments were grouped into low, enhanced and high-risk categories for ongoing longitudinal risk management. Overall clear-cut pathology was identified in 2%. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiovascular assessment is a vital tool in identifying athletes at risk of sudden cardiac death to mitigate their risk through surveillance, intervention, or participation restriction. The decision whether a player is fit to play or not requires a robust risk assessment followed by input from a multidisciplinary team that includes both the team physician and cardiologist. This educational article proposes a clinical management pathway to aid clinicians with this process. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Sudden cardiac death is the important medical cause of death during exercise. The team physician should assume responsibility for the management of the longitudinal risk of their players' cardiac assessments in conjunction with sports cardiologist.","2019","2020-05-20 00:13:22","2020-05-20 00:13:22","","500-505","","6","29","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/JSM.0000000000000534; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629767034","adult; human; soccer; adolescent; young adult; risk assessment; physiology; questionnaire; retrospective study; procedures; risk factor; sudden cardiac death; physical examination; cardiovascular disease; clinical pathway; electrocardiography; England","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, it is necessary to know the indexes that characterize official matches of F7 for the prescription of the exercise and monitoring of the training load. Therefore, the objective of the study was to analyze the physical demand of game in official matches of F7. Sixty-five male players of six federated teams of Santa Catarina agreed to participate in the study. Eight matches were analyzed in an official championship using a global positioning system (GPS) and heart rate (HR) monitor, in order to record the total distance traveled, speed and HR. The results showed a greater total distance traveled (TDTRELATIVE, 101.4 ± 11.8 vs. 96.6 ± 14.5 m.min-1), as well as lower mean HR (171 ± 10 vs. 175 ± 9 bpm) in the first half compared to the second half. From the total playing time, the athletes remained on average 48 ± 7.2% jogging, 16.5 ± 4.4% in high intensity running and 3.8 ± 1.8% in sprint. In relation to the physiological demand of the matches, it was verified that the players maintained on average 90.2 ± 2.0% HRMAX and supported 71.0 ± 23.0% of the total game time in intensity above 85% of HRMAX. We conclude that F7 players are submitted to high physical demands in official matches. Based on these findings, coaches and physical trainers can improve the prescription and monitoring of training loads, aiming at greater sports performance.

AIMS: To evaluate the prevalence and risk factors of depression and anxiety symptoms in high-level female football players. METHODS: Female football players of 10 German first league (Bundesliga) and 7 lower league teams were asked to answer a questionnaire on players' characteristics, the Center of Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and the Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale. RESULTS: A total of 290 players (184 first and 106 lower league players) took part in the study. The CES-D score indicated mild to moderate symptoms of depression in 48 (16.6%) and severe symptoms in 41 (14.1%) players. The GAD-7 score indicated an at least moderate generalised anxiety disorder in 24 (8.3%) players. The prevalence of depression symptoms and generalised anxiety disorders was similar to the female general population of similar age. However, significantly more second league players reported symptoms of depression than first league players, and thus the prevalence of depression symptoms in second league players was higher than in the general population. Only a third of the 45 (15.7%) players who stated that they currently wanted or needed psychotherapeutic support received it. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of depression and generalised anxiety symptoms in elite football players is influenced by personal and sport-specific variables. It is important to raise awareness of athletes' mental health problems in coaches and team physicians, to reduce stigma and to provide low-threshold treatment.","2019","2020-05-20 00:13:29","2020-05-20 00:13:29","","471-477","","8","53","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bjsports-2017-098033; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L627095552","adult; female; human; soccer; athlete; young adult; psychology; questionnaire; prevalence; anxiety; depression; Germany","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The primary purpose of this study is to describe and compare preseason and postseason BP measures among collegiate athletes of varied sports and sexes. A secondary purpose is to describe correlations between a BP measurement and BMI during the course of a competitive season.Methods:A prospective observational study using a sample of convenience assessed resting BP and BMI of athletes from men's soccer, cross country, and swimming; and women's volleyball, cross country, and swimming at one Division I university. Blood pressure measures were further classified as elevated, stage 1, or stage 2 hypertensive (HTN) using previously established criteria. Descriptive statistics reported athlete demographics, BP, and BMI. A pairwise t test compared and determined differences in preseason and postseason BP. Correlations of BP with BMI were examined. Statistical significance was set at P ≤.05.Results:Seventy-four athletes met preseason and postseason inclusion criteria. Preseason and postseason right-sided BP assessment identified 10.8% (n = 8), 5.4% (n = 4), and 1.3% (n = 1) and then 17.6% (n = 13), 17.6% (n = 13), and 1.3% (n = 1) athletes to have Elevated, stage 1 HTN, and stage 2 HTN measures, respectively. All BP measures demonstrated significant preseason to postseason increases (P =.001) in all sports with significantly higher BP increases in men compared with women. Furthermore, positive correlations between systolic BP and BMI were identified.Conclusions:Elevated and HTN BP measures were identified among collegiate athletes. Although significant increases in BP over time were detected, causative factors warrant further examination; however, increase in BMI may be a contributing factor. Findings of this study support routine BP assessment by physical therapists serving the collegiate athlete population.","2019","2020-05-20 00:13:31","2020-05-20 00:13:31","","53-60","","2","30","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/CPT.0000000000000085; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628706917","adult; female; human; human experiment; male; article; soccer; observational study; priority journal; prospective study; adolescent; athlete; body mass; body weight; body height; swimming; volleyball; physiotherapist; hypertension; protein intake; diastolic blood pressure; systolic blood pressure; blood pressure monitoring; elevated blood pressure; blood pressure measurement; blood pressure variability; Postseason blood pressure measurement; Preseason blood pressure measurement","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

NUMBER OF SUBJECTS: Eighty athletes from the 2015 to 2016 men's and women's basketball (BB), cross country (CC), and swimming/diving (SD) and women's soccer teams at one National Collegiate Athletic Association Division 1 university. MATERIALS/METHODS: A prospective observational study using a sample of convenience of collegiate athletes was initiated. Each athlete's sex and sport were recorded. Additionally, height, weight, seated and standing BP, and then USG were measured at both pre- and post-season encounters using standardized methodology. An orthostatic hypotension (OH) response was considered positive if either the systolic BP decreased≥20mmHg or the diastolic BP decreased≥10mmHg when transitioning from a sitting to standing position. The USG was considered positive for dehydration if ≥1.02. Descriptive statistics reported sex, sport, height, weight, and presence of OH and/ or USG at both pre- and post-season measures. Pairwise ttests determined associations in pre- and post-season OH and USG measures; whereas, the Spearman version of the correlation coefficient analyzed correlations between OH and USG with statistical significance set at P<05. RESULTS: Twenty-six males and 54 females were included from the following sports: men's BB (10), CC (10), SD (6) and women's BB (12), CC (18), SD (12), and soccer (12). Athletes' mean height was 68.7 inches (SD 11.3) and weight was 153.1 pounds (SD 14.5). Two athletes presented with OHduring pre-season measures and one continued withOH during the post-season evaluation. Seven athletes met the criteria for dehydration in pre-season and 24 met the criteria at post-season. While no significant association was identified between OH and USG during either the pre- or post-season measures (P=.83, P=.74), a significant relationship was identified between an increased height and OH (P=.004) at the post-season measure. Additionally, no correlation between OH and elevated USG was found in either the pre- or post-season measures. CONCLUSIONS: While no correlations betweenOHand USG were identified, collegiate athletes were found to have both OH responses and USG meeting the cut point for dehydration. These findings support routine assessment for OH and dehydration by physical therapists working with this population.","2019","2020-05-20 00:13:33","2020-05-20 00:13:33","","e6","","1","30","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/CPT.0000000000000104; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L627913928","adult; conference abstract; female; human; male; soccer; basketball; observational study; controlled study; major clinical study; prospective study; season; athlete; height; swimming; statistics; physiotherapist; human tissue; correlation coefficient; diastolic blood pressure; systolic blood pressure; diving; dehydration; standing; blood pressure monitoring; statistical significance; orthostatic blood pressure; orthostatic hypotension; relative density; urine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aims of this paper are to create an observational instrument based on Dynamic Systems concepts and evidence sufficient content validity to adequately and reliably recode defensive soccer behaviours. For these, a five-stage development process for validity was followed: (1) an initial literature review, instrument development, observation training; (2) adapting an existing systematic observational instrument; (3) pilot study with non-experts; (4) content validity with experts (coaches and researchers) and (5) inter- and intra-observer reliability. Using Aiken's V coefficient and its cut-off value to determine validity content, consensus was found (V > 0.67, n = 32, p < 0.05) for all items answered by participants in pilot study and for almost all subjects in the experts' study (V > 0.69, n = 12, p < 0.05). Also, Cohen's Kappa shows inter- and intra-reliability values of 0.87 and 0.90, respectively. The final model, entitled Theoretical Dynamic Model of Soccer Defence, and the observational instrument, named Soccer-Defence, with 14 criteria and category systems, and 106 categories, seems to be suitable for analysing the defensive process in soccer and could be used to find strengths or weaknesses of tactical–technical defensive patterns of play and to help coaches to better prepare their teams.

H.; Bideau, B.; Kulpa, R.","Detection of deceptive motions in rugby from visual motion cues","PLoS ONE","","1932-6203","10.1371/journal.pone.0220878","","Frequently, in rugby, players incorporate deceptive motions (e.g., a side-step) in order to pass their opponent. Previous works showed that expert defenders are more efficient in detecting deceptive motions. Performance was shown to be correlated with the evolution of the center of gravity of the attacker, suggesting that experts may rely on global motion cues. This study aims at investigating whether a representation of center of gravity can be useful for training purposes, by using this representation alone or by combining it with the local motion cues given by body parts. We designed an experiment in virtual reality to control the motion cues available to the defenders. Sixteen healthy participants (seven experts and nine novices) acted as defenders while a virtual attacker approached. Participants completed two separate tasks. The first was a time occlusion perception task, occlusion after 100ms, 200ms or 300ms after the initial change in direction, thereafter participants indicated the passing direction of the attacker. The second was a perception-action task, participants were instructed to intercept the oncoming attacker by displacing medio-laterally. The attacker performed either a non-deceptive motion, directly toward the final passing direction or a deceptive motion, initially toward a false direction before quickly reorienting to the true direction. There was a main effect of expertise, appearance, cut off times and motion on correct responses during both tasks. There was an interaction between visual appearance and expertise, and between motion type and expertise during the perception task, however, this interaction was not present during the perception-action task. We observed that experts maintained superiority in the perception of deceptive motion; however when the visual appearance is reduced to global motion alone the difference between novices and experts is reduced. We further explore the interactions and discuss the effects observed for the visual appearance and expertise.","2019","2020-05-20 00:13:40","2020-05-20 00:13:40","","","","9","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0220878; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002904679","adult; human; human experiment; male; article; rugby; controlled study; motion; normal human; task performance; association; ball sports athlete; deception; deceptive motion; expert system; movement perception; virtual reality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We used financial data from the financial statements and technical skills of players available on the Footstats website. For the regression, we considered the panel data, with a series of three years (2012-2014), each representing a cross-section with eighteen clubs. Regarding the financial variables, the revenue and expenses needed to maintain the activities were positively significant. It is noteworthy that investments in professional players and in the base categories presented a coefficient with negative sign, different from the expected. This may indicate the fact that clubs need to allocate their resources more efficiently, requiring more appropriate business management. Regarding the technical variables, passing, tackling, dribbling, fouls and defenses were statistically significant, including coefficients higher than the financial variables, indicating the relevance of these elements to sports performance, being essential that clubs seek to better use these factors to achieve better sports performance. Therefore, clubs should be able to look for sports talent that can add to their playing style and contribute to their sporting results.

En cuanto a las variables financieras, los ingresos y gastos necesarios para mantener las actividades fueron positivamente significativos. Es de destacar que las inversiones en atletas profesionales y en las categorías base presentaron un coeficiente con signo negativo, diferente del esperado. Esto puede indicar el hecho de que los clubes necesitan asignar sus recursos de manera más eficiente para establecer contrataciones, lo que requiere una gestión empresarial más adecuada.

A total of 378 head/neck injuries were recorded, and 189 (50.0%) injuries from this sample, resulted in a concussion diagnosis. Odds of concussion diagnosis were 84% higher among female players compared with their male counterparts, and over two-fold higher in game settings compared with practice settings. We also observed several significant symptom dependencies, such as higher odds of difficulty concentrating (OR = 5.84, 95% CI = [2.99, 11.42]) given concurrent light sensitivity. Furthermore, we identified injury mechanism as a determinant of concussion symptom resolution time.

Twenty-six male football players performed a maximal exercise test (Bruce protocol) on a motor-driven treadmill. Oxygen uptake (VO2) and heart rate (HR) were monitored, recorded and resampled at 3.5Hz. The ventilatory threshold (VT), and respiratory compensation (RC), heart rate deflection points (HRDP1 and HRDP2) and heart rate kinetics threshold (HRT) were determined by computerized methods. The heart rate variability (HRV) was assessed in the frequency domain. The HRT averaged 89.9 ± 1.2 % of the VO2 peak. The HRT showed poor correlations and significant differences compared with HRDP1 (r = 0.46) and VT (r = 0.51), but was not different from, and highly correlated with, HRDP2 (0.98) and RC (0.90). Bland Altman plots showed all athletes into 95% of limits of agreement, and intraclass correlation coefficient showed good agreements between points obtained from HRT compared with HRDP2 (0.96) and RC (0.98). The HRT was highly correlated with HRDP2 and RC, suggesting it could be a marker for cardiorespiratory fatigue.

Vinte e seis jogadores de futebol masculino realizaram um teste de exercício máximo (protocolo de Bruce) em uma esteira motorizada. O consumo de oxigênio (VO2) e a freqüência cardíaca (FC) foram monitorados, registrados e reamostrados a 3,5Hz. O limiar ventilatório (LV), a compensação respiratória (CR), os pontos de deflexões da frequência cardíaca (PDFC1 e PDFC2) e o limiar da cinética da frequência cardíaca (LCFC) foram determinados por métodos computadorizados. A variabilidade da frequência cardíaca (VFC) foi avaliada no domínio da frequência. A média do LCFC foi de 89,9 ± 1,2% do VO2 de pico. O LCFC demonstrou correlações e diferenças significativas em relação ao PDFC1 (r = 0,46) e ao LV (r = 0,51), mas não foi diferente e altamente correlacionado com PDFC2 (0,98) e CR (0,90). Os gráficos de Bland Altman mostraram todos os atletas em 95% dos limites de concordância, e o coeficiente de correlação intraclasse apresentou boas concordâncias entre os pontos obtidos com o LCFC em comparação com o PDFC2 (0,96) e CR (0,98). A LCFC foi altamente correlacionada com PDFC2 e CR, sugerindo que poderia ser um marcador de fadiga cardiorrespiratória.","2019","2020-05-20 00:13:47","2020-05-20 00:13:47","","1-12","","","21","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","","","","https://gateway.library.qut.edu.au/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=c8h&AN=141528633&site=ehost-live&scope=site","Heart Rate -- Physiology; Soccer; Human; Athletes; Anaerobic Threshold -- Evaluation; Cardiorespiratory Fitness; Data Analysis, Statistical -- Methods; Exercise Physiology; Exercise Test, Cardiopulmonary; Fatigue; Heart Rate -- Evaluation; Heart Rate Variability -- Diagnosis; Intraclass Correlation Coefficient; Kinetics; Oxygen Consumption -- Evaluation; Respiratory Airflow -- Evaluation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Material and Method. Forty-seven amateur soccer players aged 15-17yrs (U17) (16.21±0.68yrs, 10 center backs, 9 side backs, 10 midfielders, 11 wingers, 7 strikers) were included in the study. COD performance was assessed using the 505 and T-tests. The sit and reach test was used for the assessment of flexibility, the star excursion balance test for dynamic balance and Cooper's test for aerobic endurance. Results. The 505 test was correlated with Anterior (right) balance (p=0.036, r=0.306) and VO2max (p=0.011, r=-0.367), and the T-test was correlated with postero-lateral (left) balance (p=0.009, r=-0.377) and VO2max (p<0.0001, r=-0.564). Postero-medial (right) balance was different in favor of midfielders compared with side backs (p=0.037, 95% -23.12/-0.537). The VO2max (p=0.01) and anterior (right) balance (p=0.03) were found as significant determiners for the 505 test (R²=0.223). The VO2max (p<0.0001) and postero-lateral (left) balance (p=0.01) were found as significant determiners for the T-test (R²=0.414). Conclusions. This study showed that the aerobic endurance was a determiner for the 505 and T-tests in young male soccer players. The relationship between COD performance and dynamic balance was dependent on the COD test. COD, aerobic endurance or flexibility did not differ but dynamic balance could vary depending on the game positions.

METHODS: A total of 40 athletes from 2 sports disciplines (30 track-and-field sprinters and jumpers and 10 rugby union players) participated in this study. Maximum bar-power outputs and their respective bar velocities were assessed in the barbell hip thrust exercise. Athletes were divided, using a median split analysis, into 2 groups according to their bar-power outputs in the barbell hip thrust exercise (""higher"" and ""lower"" power groups). The magnitude-based inferences method was used to analyze the differences between groups in the power and velocity outcomes. To assess the precision of the bar velocities for determining the maximum power values, the coefficient of variation (CV%) was also calculated. RESULTS: Athletes achieved the maximum power outputs at a mean velocity, mean propulsive velocity, and peak velocity of 0.92 (0.04) m·s-1 (CV: 4.1%), 1.02 (0.05) m·s-1 (CV: 4.4%), and 1.72 (0.14) m·s-1 (CV: 8.4%), respectively. No meaningful differences were observed in the optimum bar velocities between higher and lower power groups. CONCLUSIONS: Independent of the athletes' power output and bar-velocity variable, the optimum power loads frequently occur at very close bar velocities.","2019","2020-05-20 00:13:50","2020-05-20 00:13:50","","1-5","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1123/ijspp.2019-0228; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629600556","human; article; elite athlete; rugby; hip; exercise; controlled study; muscle strength; track and field","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The dynamical systems approach, where the complex relationships between players is emphasised, predicts that goal scoring opportunities are preceded by instability in the balance between the two teams' behaviours. The aim was to create operational definitions for determining unstable game states to facilitate the identification of perturbations, that is the causes of instability. Validity tests involving four English Premier League (EPL) football coaches and two performance analysts and subsequent reliability tests established five unstable game states; penalty box possession, counter attack, ratio of attacking to defending players, successful cross and successful shot. Eighteen EPL matches were analysed to present exemplar statistics for three teams of different standard (based on final league position) suggesting that teams create unstable situations differently, likely due to individual player characteristics, with home advantage and opposition strength effects, suggesting this may be a component of what constitutes a performance indicator for a team. Future studies need to consider individual player actions that create instability as well as provide objective measures that substantiate findings.

In this idea, coordination is addressed in the football game of children aged 10-12 through specific tests. Experimental pedagogy took place within a sports club from Braşov city to the age group of 10-12 years, practicing the football game. Through the three tests specifically used in the research, a correlation between football co-ordination (component of proprioception) and the specific football-specific coordination skill (skill) was attempted. The pedagogical experiment included two initial and final tests, through which the subjects were evaluated at three specific control samples adapted to their age. The tasks pursued in the pedagogical experiment, through the three specific tests, focused on the registration of specific indicators of the fieldless ball movement on the one hand, and on the other hand specific aspects of the ball biomechanics, the basic condition of the manifestation of the specific technique of the subjects in the football game. At the end of the scientific research, we validated the experimental hypothesis through the conclusions formulated. This has demonstrated the existence of a direct correlation between the level of subject coordination and the specific skill gaming indices resulting from the applied tests.

In the present study, endogenous steroids were extracted using a Strata-XL polymeric reverse phase cartridge. The isolated steroids were reacted with 2-hydrazino-1- methylpyridine (HMP) at 50 °C for 30 min. A liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used in a positive mode with multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) for the quantification of testosterone (T) and its precursor, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), in saliva samples collected from twenty young Saudi professional soccer players. The analytes were separated on an ACE Ultracore 2.5 Superphenylhexyl column (150 × 3.0 mm id). The extraction recovery during the pre-treatment was >89% and gave <±20% for inter- and intra-assay precision and accuracy. The limits of quantification (LOQ) were found to be 20 pg/mL for (T and DHEA) and 50 pg/mL for Epitestosterone (EPI). The results showed no significant variation in the concentration of T between pre and post training, whereas DHEA was significantly increased after short-term exercise. These results could indicate that there is no correlation between T and its precursor DHEA level following short term physical activity. EPI concentrations could not be detected with a LOQ of 50 pg/mL in the saliva samples.","2019","2020-05-20 00:14:03","2020-05-20 00:14:03","","","","2","87","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002182646; http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/scipharm87020011","adult; human; male; article; soccer player; clinical article; exercise; controlled study; high performance liquid chromatography; sensitivity and specificity; testosterone; comparative study; validation process; process optimization; androgen; prasterone; drug specificity; drug stability; electrospray; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; epitestosterone; G6430A; limit of detection; limit of quantitation; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; mass spectrometer; mass spectrometry; matrix effect; measurement accuracy; measurement precision; multiple reaction monitoring; radioimmunoassay; saliva; saliva analysis; saliva collector; Salivette; tandem mass spectrometry","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Many players (academy and senior) strive to increase muscle mass during the pre-season, however, quantification of changes during this period have not been thoroughly investigated. We therefore assessed changes in body-composition using Dual X-Ray Absorptiometry (DXA) in eleven academy players over three successive pre-seasons and ninety-three senior players from four different European Super League clubs prior to, and at the end of, a pre-season training period. There was no meaningful change in lean mass of the academy players during any of the pre-season periods (year 1 = 72.3 ± 7.1 to 73.2 ± 7.2 kg; ES 0.05, year 2 = 74.4 ± 6.9 to 75.5 ± 6.9 kg; ES 0.07, year 3 = 75.9 ± 6.7 to 76.8 ± 6.6 kg; ES 0.06) with small changes only occurring over the three-year study period (72.3 to 75.9 kg; ES = 0.22). Senior players showed trivial changes in all characteristics during the pre-season period (total mass = 95.1 to 95.0 kg; ES -0.01, lean mass = 74.6 to 75.1 kg; ES 0.07, fat mass = 13.6 to 12.9 kg; ES -0.17, body fat percentage = 14.8 to 14.1%; ES -0.19). These data suggest that academy players need time to develop towards profiles congruent with senior players. Moreover, once players reach senior level, body-composition changes are trivial during the pre-season and therefore teams may need to individualise training for players striving to gain muscle mass by reducing other training loads.","2019","2020-05-20 00:14:05","2020-05-20 00:14:05","","1-27","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17461391.2019.1695953; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629969531","human; article; rugby; season; team sport; muscle mass; body fat; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; fat mass; nutrition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For laboratory validation, data from the mouthpiece sensor was compared to standard sensors mounted in a headform at the center of gravity as the headform was struck with a swinging pendulum. Linear regression between peak kinematics measured from the mouthpiece and headform showed strong correlation, with r2 values of 0.95 (slope = 1.02) for linear acceleration, 1.00 (slope = 1.00) for angular velocity, and 0.97 (slope = 0.96) for angular acceleration.

The average age of the participants was 21 ± 5 years, the average height was 167.5 ± 5 cm, and the average body mass was 62.53 ± 9.8 kg. The average energy expenditure of the participants was 2811 ± 493 kcal/day, and their average energy intake was 1476 ± 434 kcal/day. The average consumption of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins was 199 ± 20.6, 47.3 ± 20.7, and 72.3 ± 24.2 g/day, respectively. There was a prevalence of inadequate intake of potassium, calcium, magnesium, iodine, vitamins D, E and B1, and folate in the diet of the examined group. The remaining micronutrients were consumed in the prescribed amounts by at least 50% of the examined group. The participants demonstrated low energy intakes, and consequently, low consumption of macronutrients and a large number of micronutrients.","2019","2020-05-20 00:14:14","2020-05-20 00:14:14","","","","7","16","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph16071134; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2001813586","adult; female; human; article; soccer player; controlled study; adolescent; body mass; prevalence; body height; alpha tocopherol; calcium; caloric intake; carbohydrate intake; energy expenditure; fat intake; magnesium; protein intake; trace element; vitamin D; clinical evaluation; dietary intake; folic acid; iodine; nutritional assessment; nutritional requirement; Polish citizen; potassium; thiamine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In some cases, this includes modifying body composition through weight gain or fat loss. This study aimed to describe the macronutrient intakes of professional rugby union players during pre-season training. It was hypothesized that players required to gain weight would have a higher energy, carbohydrate and protein intake compared to those needing to lose weight. Twenty-three professional rugby players completed 3 days of dietary assessment and their sum of eight skinfolds were assessed. Players were divided into three groups by the team coaches and medical staff: weight gain, weight maintain and weight loss. Mean energy intakes were 3,875 ± 907 kcal·d-1 (15,965 ± 3,737 kJ·d-1) (weight gain 4,532 ± 804 kcal·d-1; weight maintain 3,825 ± 803 kcal·d-1; weight loss 3,066 ± 407 kcal·d-1) and carbohydrate intakes were 3.7 ± 1.2 g·kg-1·d-1 (weight gain 4.8 ± 0.9 g.kg-1·d-1; weight maintain 2.8 ± 0.7 g·kg-1·d-1; weight loss 2. 6 ± 0.7 g·kg-1·d-1). The energy and carbohydrate intakes are similar to published intakes among rugby union players. There were significant differences in energy intake and the percent of energy from protein between the weight gain and the weight loss group.","2019","2020-05-20 00:14:16","2020-05-20 00:14:16","","1557988319891350","","6","13","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1557988319891350; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L630004890","human; article; rugby; clinical article; observational study; controlled study; season; team sport; medical staff; caloric intake; carbohydrate; carbohydrate intake; protein intake; body weight loss; body composition; skinfold; New Zealand; nutritional assessment; body weight gain; macronutrient; maleic hydrazide","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For this purpose, the internal and external load responses of 10 youth soccer players were analysed during training sessions characterized by 2 small sided games (SSG) based on a 5vs5 with the goalkeeper, performed in three 4-minute sets with 2 minutes of passive recovery, keeping the same pitch area per player (120 m2), but different spatial orientations (30x40 m versus 40x30 m). The results showed that regardless of the orientation of the playing space used, players' performance decreased over the sets, obtaining higher DT, DT> VT2 and accelerations between 2 and 4 m/m·s-2 in the first set compared to the third, with substantially higher values of subjective perception effort in the latter. When both JRs were compared, greater running demands and accelerations were obtained when the depth was prioritized over the width. This study demonstrates the importance of programming adequate recovery times between JR series to maintain the physical demands, as well as it emphasizes the role of game spatial orientation as one of the elements that coaches can use to modify JR physical demands. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR El objetivo de este estudio fue comprobar la influencia de la modificación de la orientación del espacio de juego (mayor anchura o profundidad) en la carga interna y externa de los jugadores de fútbol relativizada en función de su perfil físico. Para ello se analizó la respuesta de carga interna y externa de 10 jugadores juveniles de fútbol durante dos sesiones de entrenamiento donde realizaron 2 juegos reducidos (JR) durante 3 series de 4 minutos con 2 minutos de recuperación en un 5vs5 con portero, con un mismo espacio relativo por jugador (120 m2) pero distinta orientación del espacio (30x40 m vs 40x30 m). Los resultados mostraron como independientemente de la orientación del espacio de juego utilizado, el rendimiento de los jugadores disminuyó a medida que avanzaba el número de series, realizando una mayor DT, DT>VT2 y aceleraciones entre 2 y 4 m/m·s-2 en la primera serie respecto a la tercera, encontrando en esta última substancialmente mayores valores de percepción subjetiva esfuerzo. Cuando se compararon ambos JR se obtuvieron mayores demandas de carrera y aceleraciones cuando se priorizó la profundidad respecto a la anchura.

Differences in change of direction speed and deficit between male and female national rugby sevens players. J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2019-The aims of this study were to assess the change of direction (COD) deficit in different tasks and to investigate the differences in COD ability and COD deficit between male and female rugby sevens players. Thirty-six elite rugby players from the Brazilian National senior sevens teams (18 males and 18 females) completed the following physical assessments: squat and countermovement jumps; drop jump from a 45-cm height; horizontal single and triple jumps; 40-m linear sprint; Pro-agility, L-drill, and Zig-zag COD tests; and 1 repetition maximum test in the squat exercise. The differences between male and female performances were determined using magnitude-based inferences, an independent t test, and effect sizes (ES). Pearson's product-moment correlations were performed to determine the relationships among the different COD velocities and COD deficits. Men demonstrated likely to almost certainly significantly higher performances than women in all speed-power assessments and COD tasks (ES ranging from 0.61 to 2.09; p < 0.05), with the exception of the Zig-zag drill (ES = 0.24; p > 0.05). Furthermore, males displayed significantly greater COD deficits in all tests and higher sprint momentum (ES ranging from 0.78 to 2.95; p < 0.05). Large significant relationships among COD velocities (r ranging from 0.71 to 0.88; p < 0.05) and almost perfect significant correlations among all COD deficits (r ranging from 0.90 to 0.95; p < 0.05) were obtained in both sexes. The present results indicate that male rugby players are less efficient at changing direction, relative to their maximum sprint velocity. In addition, the correlations between the different COD deficits and COD speeds suggest that elite rugby players demonstrate similar ability to change direction, independently of the angle of directional change. From a practical perspective, this implies that a more comprehensive training strategy including eccentric exercises, acceleration-deceleration drills, and directional change technique is warranted to improve the COD ability (and reduce the COD deficit) of faster and more powerful rugby sevens players.","2019","2020-05-20 00:14:19","2020-05-20 00:14:19","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1519/JSC.0000000000003195; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628131961","adult; female; human; human experiment; male; article; rugby; case report; clinical article; exercise; deceleration; height; agility; effect size","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One hundred fifty-two professional (3rd league: n = 78; 4th league: n = 74) male soccer players (mean ± SD; age: 24.7 ± 4.37 years, body mass: 80.8 ± 7.33 kg, body height: 1.83 ± 0.06 m) volunteered for the investigation. Players were categorized as goalkeepers, central defenders, central midfielders, wings and forward. Players completed a treadmill test, at incremental speeds, to determine running velocity at different blood lactate concentrations (v2 = 2 mmol/l; v4 = 4 mmol/l; and v6 = 6 mmol/l). In addition, the largest difference between positions for running velocity was found at the lactate threshold v2 (p = 0.005). The running data revealed that only goalkeepers had significantly lower velocities at the lactate thresholds compared to outfield players. The central midfielders showed the highest average performance level at the lactate thresholds (v2: 12.5 ± 1.20 km/h; v4: 15.2 ± 1.14 km/h; and v6: 16.6 ± 1.14 km/h). In conclusion, this study provides soccer and position-specific reference data for the running performance of male professional German soccer players to evaluate the endurance performance in a standardized way. In this context, future research should extend the database for the first and second leagues. Further research assessing running performance during competition matches over the entire season is required to validate the endurance test performance data.","2019","2020-05-20 00:14:22","2020-05-20 00:14:22","","","","JUL","10","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2019.00886; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628686296","adult; human; male; article; soccer player; team sport; athlete; body mass; young adult; running; velocity; athletic performance; treadmill test; anthropometry; lactic acid; lactate blood level; endurance training; German (citizen); program evaluation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A secondary aim was, within each sport, to study the differences in sprint mechanical F-V profile between sexes and players of different levels. METHODS: A total of 102 soccer players (63 men) and 77 futsal players (49 men) who were competing from the elite to amateur levels in the Spanish league participated in this investigation. The testing procedure consisted of 3 unloaded maximal 40-m sprints. The velocity-time data recorded by a radar device were used to calculate the variables of the sprint acceleration F-V profile (maximal theoretical force [F0], maximal theoretical velocity [V0], maximal power [Pmax], decrease in the ratio of horizontal to resultant force [DRF], and maximal ratio of horizontal to resultant force [RFpeak]). RESULTS: Futsal players showed a higher F0 than soccer players (effect size [ES] range: 0.11-0.74), while V0 (ES range: -0.48 to -1.15) and DRF (ES range: -0.75 to -1.45) was higher for soccer players. No significant differences were observed between soccer and futsal players for Pmax (ES range: -0.43 to 0.19) and RFpeak (ES range: -0.49 to 0.30). Men and high-level players presented an overall enhanced F-V profile compared with women and their lower-level counterparts, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The higher F0 and lower V0 of futsal players could be caused by the game's specific demands (larger number of accelerations but over shorter distances than in soccer). These results show that the sprint mechanical F-V profile is able to distinguish between soccer and futsal players.","2019","2020-05-20 00:14:25","2020-05-20 00:14:25","","478-485","","4","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1123/ijspp.2018-0402; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L626898499","adult; female; human; male; soccer; acceleration; biomechanics; exercise; physiology; running; cross-sectional study; procedures; athletic performance; competitive behavior; sex factor","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Evidence indicates that Polynesians have greater stores of absolute and relative abdominal fat mass and this is known to confer cardiometabolic risk. The aims of this study were to 1) explore the relationship between ethnicity, visceral adipose tissue (VAT), and cardiometabolic disease risk markers in elite Caucasian and Polynesian rugby union athletes, and 2) assess the impact of a pre-season training program on these markers. Twenty-two professional rugby union athletes of Caucasian (n = 11) and Polynesian (n = 11) descent underwent physique assessment via surface anthropometry, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and magnetic resonance imaging before and after an 11-week pre-season. A fasted blood test was undertaken at both time points. Compared to Caucasians, at baseline Polynesians displayed significantly higher VAT (771 ± 609 cm3 vs 424 ± 235 cm3; p = 0.043), triglycerides (1.0 ± 0.9 mmol/L vs 0.6 ± 0.2 mmol/L; p = 0.050), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (3.1 ± 0.9 mmol/L vs 2.3 ± 0.7 mmol/L; p = 0.019). Similar changes were observed in both groups over the pre-season period in VAT and blood biochemical markers. Polynesian rugby union athletes were more likely than Caucasians to exhibit risk factors associated with cardiometabolic disease, such as elevated VAT and unfavourable lipid profiles. Further longitudinal research is required to identify and explain the short- and long-term risk of cardiometabolic disease in athletes of Polynesian descent.","2019","2020-05-20 00:14:30","2020-05-20 00:14:30","","1-36","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17461391.2019.1656291; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629078161","human; article; rugby; Caucasian; Polynesian; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; clinical article; controlled study; season; training; ethnicity; risk assessment; lipid fingerprinting; triacylglycerol; risk factor; anthropometry; body fat; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; intra-abdominal fat; cardiometabolic risk; low density lipoprotein cholesterol","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The lateral ankle sprain is induced by sport gestures involving changes of direction and landing manoeuvres and constitutes a risk factor for the occurrence of chronic ankle instability. Although cleat models and performance have been already explored, no study has evaluated this relationship in athletes with chronic ankle instability. Therefore, the purpose of the study was to analyse the influence of different soccer cleat models on Side Hop Test performance of athletes with and without chronic ankle instability. Thirty-nine athletes were divided into two groups, a chronic ankle instability group (n = 20) and a healthy group (n = 19). Each participant performed the Side Hop Test, executing 10 consecutive jumps on dry artificial grass with 4 cleat models. The Qualisys System and two force platforms were used to analyse the test runtime, the distance travelled and the mean velocity. No statistically significant interaction was observed between the group and the cleat model for all variables evaluated. In addition, no differences were observed between models or groups. In this specific test, performance does not seem to be influenced by different cleat models on dry artificial grass in athletes with and without chronic ankle instability.

Nevertheless, the appropriate intensity during EOT remains unknown. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of the inertial load used during an EOT program on performance adaptations in rugby union players. METHODS: Fifteen rugby players were divided into a low (0.025 kg⋅m²; G 0.025) or a high (0.075 kg⋅m²; G 0.075) inertial load for training. Both groups trained using the flywheel half squat exercise twice a week during the seven-week EOT. Athletic performance was evaluated by testing the half squat maximum repetition (IRM), countermovement jump (CMJ), 40 m linear sprint, the modified agility T-Test, and power output in the flywheel squat exercise. Data were analysed using magnitude-based inferences. RESULTS: Both groups improved their IRM and CMJ to a similar extent. Nevertheless, the G 0.025 showed likely trivial changes in linear sprint (ES=-0.02), and possibly positive effects on the agility T-Test (ES=0.16), while the G 0.075 showed possibly negative effects on 40 m linear sprint (ES=-0.23) and likely trivial effects on the T-Test (ES=0.07).

Linear and angular accelerations of all segments within a multi-linked system can be expressed as the sum of contributions from a joint torque term, gravitational force term and motion-dependent term (MDT), where the MDT is a nonlinear term consisting of centrifugal force, Coriolis force and gyroscopic effect moment components. Direct effects result from angular accelerations induced by a joint torque at a given instant, whereas indirect effects arise through the MDT induced by joint torques exerted in the past. These two effects were quantified for the kicking-side leg during a rugby place kick. The MDT was the largest contributor to the foot centre of gravity (CG)’s speed at ball contact. Of the factors responsible for generating the MDT, the direct and indirect effects of the hip flexion-extension torque during both the flight phase (from the final kicking foot take-off to support foot contact) and the subsequent support phase (from support foot contact to ball contact) were important contributors to the foot CG's speed at ball contact. The indirect effect of the ankle plantar-dorsal flexion torque and the direct effect of the knee flexion-extension torque during the support phase showed the largest positive and negative contributions to the foot CG's speed at ball contact, respectively. The proposed method allows the identification of which individual joint torque axes are crucial and the timings of joint torque exertion that are used to generate a high speed of the distal point of a multi-linked system.","2019","2020-05-20 00:14:37","2020-05-20 00:14:37","","8-16","","","86","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiomech.2019.01.032; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2001544753","article; rugby; hip; acceleration; exercise; controlled study; ankle; knee function; foot; quantitative analysis; torque; gravity; Coriolis phenomenon","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The goal of the present study was to determine whether retired Canadian Football League (CFL) athletes with a history of concussions exhibit alterations in neurocognitive functioning, along with changes in physical, social, and psychological health. Methods: Our study compared nineteen retired CFL athletes’ concussion histories to eighteen healthy age-matched controls with no history of concussion. Self-report inventories were used to assess depression, memory, attention, and general health. Neurophysiological markers of cognitive function were evaluated with event-related brain potentials (ERPs) as measured in two protocols: (1) A Mismatch Negativity (MMN) protocol for assessing the automatic early attentional brain mechanism; and, (2) a P300 auditory oddball task for assessing consciously controlled attention. Results: Relative to controls, CFL players exhibited: response delays and reduced amplitudes in neurophysiological responses; overall decreases in cognitive function; and poorer scores on self-reports of physical, social, and psychological health; reflecting problems in all three categories. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that multiple concussions sustained over several years can lead to altered cognitive and psychosocial function. Significance: Neurophysiological markers of conscious and pre-conscious attention provide an objective assessment for evaluating long-term cognitive consequences of concussion.","2019","2020-05-20 00:14:44","2020-05-20 00:14:44","","111-121","","1","130","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clinph.2018.10.013; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2001347191","adult; football player; human; article; clinical article; priority journal; controlled study; concussion; velocity; cognition; attention; cognitive defect; reaction time; verbal memory; visual memory; middle aged; demography; self report; nervous system parameters; aged; motor speed; Short Form 36; Beck Depression Inventory; cognitive efficiency index; electroencephalogram; event related potential; impulse control; mismatch negativity; neurologic disease assessment; neurophysiology; Post Concussion Syndrome Scale","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The study examined 50 healthy male professional football players (age 18.8±0.8yr; height 176.8 ±6.9cm; weight 71.3±5.7kg) belonging to 3 of the reserve squads of three Spanish La-Liga clubs divided in 2 intervention teams [Nordic-Group1 (NG-1) and Nordic-Group2 (NG-2, extensive experience in NHE)] and 1 team as a control-group (CG). NHEs and linear sprint (T5, T10, T20-m) were evaluated at the beginning of the season and at the end of an intervention period of conditioning and football training, supplemented with a NHE protocol (24 sessions for NG-1 and 22 sessions for NG-2) or without using the NHE at all (CG). Sprint times were substantially improved in all groups (ES from -2.24±0.75 to -0.60±0.37). NHEs was enhanced absolute and relative to body-mass only in NG-1 after the training period (ES from 0.84±0.32 to 0.74±0.26), while in the NG-2 there were only improvements in average NHEs relative to body-mass (ES = 0.39±0.36). The improvements in T20-m were substantially greater in NG-2 vs. NG-1, and there were no differences in sprint performance changes between NG-1 and CG. Changes in sprinting performance and NHEs were unrelated. NHEs was largely correlated with the body-mass of the players. Results indicate that the improvements in sprint are not dependent on the NHEs changes, with no relationships between NHEs and sprint performance, and between sprint changes and changes in NHEs.","2019","2020-05-20 00:14:45","2020-05-20 00:14:45","","","","3","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0213375; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2001700798","adult; football player; human; male; article; hamstring muscle; clinical article; exercise; controlled study; season; young adult; body weight; height; dissociation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2019-The aim of this study was to use global position systems to analyze the external loads of the 3 different acquisition training sessions (ATS) with competitive matches in professional soccer players over a 6-week period. Sixteen professional soccer players participated in the study, which analyzed the distribution of external load during the training microcycle of a professional soccer team. The 3 types of ATS undertaken by the players were as follows: ATS1 (strength), ATS2 (endurance), and ATS3 (speed). The total distance covered, the distance covered at above 14 km·h, the distance covered >21 km·h, the number of high accelerations (>3 m·s), and player load were recorded. The results showed that external loads were consistently higher during matches when compared with all training sessions (range of effect sizes: 1.06-3.38). Between training session comparisons revealed higher external loads during ATS1 and ATS2, when compared with ATS3 (range of effect sizes: 0.60-2.41). The only external load variable that differed between ATS1 and ATS2 was the distance covered >21 km·h, which was higher for ATS1. Our findings suggest that technical staff should consider the physical demands of weekly periodization to understand the training process regarding optimizing player physical performance.","2019","2020-05-20 00:14:47","2020-05-20 00:14:47","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1519/JSC.0000000000003363; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629202413","human; article; soccer player; acceleration; controlled study; physical performance; endurance; effect size","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

I football players predicts development of lower extremity (LE) injuries during a season and whether implementing an ankle strength/proprioception program for those with elevated BESS can diminish this risk. Methods: This study was a retrospective review of pre-season BESS scores and injury reports from the 2014 and 2015 football seasons with the primary outcome of interest being LE injuries. A secondary analysis was performed with data from the 2016, 2017 and 2018 seasons in which a prophylactic proprioception and ankle strengthening program was implemented for players with BESS scores $15. Results: In the control group (2014 and 2015 seasons), the odds of lower extremity injury during the season in players with BESS scores $15 was 0.74 [95% Confidence Interval (CI), 0.31-1.73]. A secondary intention to treat analysis of the relative risk of having a LE injury in players with elevated BESS scores in the 2016, 2017 and 2018 seasons who were given an ankle proprioception and strengthening program versus those who did not receive the rehabilitative program was 1.68 (95% CI, 1.01-2.79), which is statistically significant. Conclusions: Elevated pre-season BESS scores ($15) were not predictive of a significantly increased risk of sustaining a LE injury during the following season. However, the implementation of an ankle strengthening and proprioceptive program for players with BESS scores of $15 during the 2016-2018 seasons significantly increased the incidence of LE injury during the season in those athletes compared to those who did not receive the rehab program. Significance: BESS scores are not predictive of LE injury risk, but an ankle rehab program may increase the risk of LE injury in football athletes. Providers should continue to search for modifiable risk factors to decrease LE injury risk in athletes.","2019","2020-05-20 00:14:48","2020-05-20 00:14:48","","117","","2","29","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/JSM.0000000000000724; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629860522","conference abstract; football player; human; controlled study; incidence; season; scoring system; outcome assessment; retrospective study; ankle; proprioception; risk factor; leg injury; secondary analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An Analysis of Social Media Responses to the Recent FIFA Scandal","Journal of Global Sport Management","","24704067","","","Given the fact that the governing body of world football, FIFA, has managed to survive major failures in sports governance, this paper addresses the role of football consumers as potential principals. By characterizing FIFA as a 'political machine' and using 'digital trace data' from Twitter to analyze responses to the most recent FIFA corruption scandal, this paper introduces a new methodological approach to the realm of research on sports governance. Key events of FIFA's corruption scandal trigger significant activities, but the attention is ephemeral as it decreases over time. In addition, there is little evidence that the corruption scandal has a detrimental effect on FIFA's legitimacy among users. Ultimately, online activism striving to change FIFA's governance seems to have only rudimentarily developed and is sparsely popular among individual football fans. The paper casts further doubts on the ability of football consumers to act as effective principals in football governance.

Emotional intelligence could participate to promote soccer referees' better adjustment. The relations between emotional intelligence and coping could also discriminate soccer referees according to their level of expertise. Thus, the aim of this study is to explore the influences of emotional intelligence among soccer officials, by analyzing the relations between emotional intelligence, the level of expertise level, and the use of coping strategies. Two studies were conducted in which 116 and 75 soccer referees participated. They completed two inventories related to emotional intelligence and coping. Results indicated the presence of two profiles of emotional intelligence. In comparison to the moderate emotional intelligence cluster, most of the high-skilled referees belonged to the moderately high emotional intelligence profile. Furthermore, the dimensions of emotional intelligence predicted significantly and positively the use of task-oriented coping. These results provide a new contribution to the literature in sport psychology on emotional intelligence and coping and propose further perspectives for sport officials' psychological preparation. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR L'arbitrage en sport est une fonction particulièrement stressante qui demande de faire face efficacement à de nombreuses pressions interpersonnelles. L'intelligence émotionnelle permettrait ainsi de favoriser un meilleur ajustement des arbitres de football. Les relations entre l'intelligence émotionnelle et le coping pourraient également permettre de discriminer les arbitres selon leur niveau d'expertise. Le but de cette étude est donc d'explorer les influences de l'intelligence émotionnelle chez des arbitres de football en analysant ses relations avec le niveau d'expertise et l'utilisation des stratégies de coping. Deux études ont été conduites auprès d'arbitres de football de différents niveaux (étude 1, n = 116 ; étude 2, n = 75), ayant complété deux échelles mesurant l'intelligence émotionnelle et les stratégies de coping. Les résultats indiquent la présence de deux profils distincts d'intelligence émotionnelle. Les arbitres officiant sur des rencontres de haut niveau appartiennent majoritairement au cluster modérément élevé en intelligence émotionnelle comparativement aux arbitres évoluant sur des rencontres de moins bon niveau qui constituent principalement un second profil dans lequel le degré d'intelligence émotionnelle est plus bas. De plus, les dimensions constitutives de l'intelligence émotionnelle prédisent toutes significativement l'utilisation du coping orienté sur la tâche. Ces résultats offrent une contribution nouvelle à la littérature en psychologie du sport sur l'intelligence émotionnelle et le coping ainsi que de futures perspectives pour la préparation psychologiques des officiels en sport.

Sport organizations that host events are pulsating organizations because they gain an influx of workers for a short duration. The influx often consists of atypical workers including independent contractors, seasonal workers, temporary workers, interns, prison workers, and volunteers. Atypical workers have fewer rights and protections compared with standard employees. So, when sport organizations swell to include these underprotected workers, they may create situations where worker exploitation or litigation are likely. The authors used an exploratory doctrinal-comparative analysis to examine the legal employment relations established between sport event workers and pulsating organizations. A doctrinal analysis of US Federal labor law revealed 13 worker categories, with distinct rights and protections, which may be found at sport events. The authors used exploratory methods to apply the categories to a season of college football home games at an FBS Division I University. Workers belonging to every category except one (prison labor) were observed. The findings confirmed that, when sport organizations swell, they tend to gain workers belonging to categories with fewer legal protections. It is also estimated that at least 28 percent of workers on any given game day misclassified themselves as volunteers. Subsequently, there is evidence that sport events, because of the influx of atypical workers, may create exploitive and sometimes litigious situations.

Investigating skill patterns in Australian football","Science & Medicine in Football","","24734446","","","Objectives: To examine the frequency of task-constraints between game-scenario training drills and competition games for all disposals, by considering, temporal, distance, pressure and related situational factors. Methods: The skill patterns of elite-level Australian football players (n = 33) were compared relative to playing environment (training/games), disposal type (handballs/kicks), and further categorised by 'state of play' factors. Results: Game measures relating to high-intensity pressure applied to the ball-carrier and receiving players were significantly under-represented during training, particularly for kicks (all p < 0.001). Physical pressure acts such as tackling were more frequent in games (p < 0.001). Further, kicks executed in 0-1 s also occurred more frequently in games compared to training (p < 0.001). For handballs, most (8/9) constraint frequencies were higher at training than in games (p < 0.03–0.001). Conclusion: It is likely that for training to more closely resemble games, ball-disposals (especially kicking) must be produced under highly contested conditions and executed within minimal time. These findings may enhance current training practices in the Australian football league, as well as assist in the development and prescription of innovative training drills to better prepare players for the specific game demands they experience.

During a play, he was struck on the superior left head causing axial compression, extension, right side bending and rotation. Patient collapsed motionless in prone position. He reported a brief loss of consciousness, severe neck pain and could not move or feel his arms or legs. Two minutes after the impact the patient regained minimal movements of his lower extremities. Cervical spine precautions were initiated with prone log roll, facemask removal and cervical stabilization with pads and helmet in place utilizing the athletic tape method. He was carted off the field and into the training room awaiting transport to the nearest trauma center. The patient continued to have slow improvements in sensation and strength post injury before the patient was transported via EMS. Physical Exam: Primary Survey. Airway: Patent with no apparent obstruction. No audible wheezing or stridor. Cervical spine stabilized with athletic tape across helmet and secured to spine board. Breathing: Patient actively ventilating unassisted. Minimally tachypneic with no signs of fatigue. Able to speak full sentences without difficulty. Circulation: No bleeding apparent. Patient fully conscious. Disability: Mental status A and O x4. Initial complete quadriparesis and GCS = 9. Positive tenderness to palpation of mid-line cervical spine at approximately C4-C7 region. Environment/Exposure: Patient laying prone on turf with forearms crossed underneath chest. Full football protective gear in place. Differential Diagnosis: Acute Cervical Disc Herniation Cervical Spine Fracture Cervical Spine Dislocation Spinal Cord Injury Cervical Longitudinal Ligament Disruption Test Results: MRI Cervical Spine w/o Contrast-C3 to C4 3 mm broad based disk bulge w/thecal sac effacement. Thecal sac = 11 mm. C4-C5 4 to 5 mm broad based disk bulge with complete effacement of anterior thecal sac with impression on the cord. C4-C5 neuroforaminal narrowing. C7 focal hydro-syringomelia. Cervical Spine CT w/o Contrast-2 mm ante-rolisthesis of C4 on C5. Bilateral laminar C4 fracture with left inferior facet fracture extending into pars interarticularis. C4-C5 left perched interfacetal dislocation. Final Diagnosis: Transient Quadriplegia due to spinal cord injury secondary to unstable cervical bilateral laminar fractures of C4-C5 with left C4 inferior facet fracture/dislocation and pars interarticularis fracture. Discussion: Although infrequent, cervical spine injuries can produce catastrophic morbidity and mortality. The sideline physician thus needs to be aware of the signs and symptoms in order to initiate cervical spine conditions early in management to avoid secondary neurological injury. Multiple guidelines within the literature suggest that when symptoms occur bilaterally, immobilization and evaluation must be initiated. This should occur regardless if patient has symptomatic improvement. A well-coordinated and rehearsed multidisci-plinary approach was necessary in the appropriate sideline management of this injury. Post-injury debriefing also resulted in multiple emergency action plan improvements. Outcome: Patient underwent emergent C4-C5 ORIF, C4-C5 discectomy with anterior single level fusion, C4-C5 bilateral foraminotomies and C4-C5 spinal cord decompression. Surgery was tolerated well with no complications. Patient was discharged from the hospital on day #9 with decreased right grip strength and dizziness. He then completed 6 weeks outpatient rehabilitation and is doing well. Follow-up: Patient did not participate for the rest of the season and rested at home with family while undergoing rehabilitation.

G.","Does a bounding exercise program prevent hamstring injuries in adult male soccer players? - A cluster-RCT","Scandinavian journal of medicine & science in sports","","1600-0838","10.1111/sms.13353","","BACKGROUND: Although the Nordic Hamstring Exercise (NHE) prevents hamstring injury in soccer players effectively, the annual incidence of these injuries still increases. This may be because of poor long-term compliance with the program. Furthermore, the timing and amplitude of gluteal and core muscle activation seem to play an important role in hamstring injury prevention, the NHE program was not designed to improve activation of these muscles. Therefore, we propose plyometric training as an alternative to reduce hamstring injuries in soccer players. PURPOSE: To determine the preventive effect of the Bounding Exercise Program (BEP) on hamstring injury incidence and severity in adult male amateur soccer players. STUDY DESIGN: A cluster-Randomized Controlled Trial. METHODS: Thirty-two soccer teams competing in the first-class amateur league were cluster-randomized into the intervention or control group. Both groups were instructed to perform their regular training program, and the intervention group additionally performed BEP. Information about player characteristics was gathered at baseline and exposure, hamstring injuries and BEP compliance were weekly registered during one season (2016-2017). RESULTS: The data of 400 players were analyzed. In total, 57 players sustained 65 hamstring injuries. The injury incidence was 1.12/1000 hours in the intervention group and 1.39/1000 hours in the control group. There were no statistically significant differences in hamstring injury incidence (OR = 0.89, 95% CI 0.46-1.75) or severity between the groups (P > 0.48). CONCLUSION: In this large cluster-randomized controlled trial, no evidence was found for plyometric training in its current form to reduce hamstring injuries in amateur soccer players.","2019","2020-05-20 00:14:58","2020-05-20 00:14:58","","515-523","","4","29","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L626759622; http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/sms.13353","adult; human; male; soccer; hamstring muscle; injury; controlled study; adolescent; athlete; young adult; randomized controlled trial; plyometrics; soft tissue injury; leg injury","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Rooney Rule, first piloted by English Football League (EFL) clubs during the 2016-17 season, makes it compulsory for all 72 EFL clubs to interview at least one black, Asian or minority ethnic (BAME) candidate (if an application has been received) for all managerial and first-team coaching roles. And, on 9 January 2018, the Football Association revealed that they had also adopted the Rooney Rule for all coaching jobs relating to the England national team. Because English football harbours so few BAME coaches, calls for the Rooney Rule to be introduced in English football had started to increase in volume, and led to its trial inception. But, is this policy welcomed or opposed among British Asian coaches? What fundamental barriers does this policy overlook? Is English football ready for the Rooney Rule? And, do British Asian coaches, a group believed to benefit from this positive action policy, deem that this rule is the answer to help facilitate positive change? With the aid of empirical research, this article critically examines and assesses the potential impact of the Rooney Rule and recommends additional inclusionary practices.

Method: Data from 42 matches of 9 outfields, professional football players were collected in temperatures ranging from 13°C to 37°C and relative humidity ranging from 11% to 83%. Individual player data were only included if a player had played a full match (>90+ min) and had completed at least one full match in each of the four available environmental heat stress risk conditions of low, moderate, high and excessive. Results: Significant effects were observed for run speed (p =.001), high speed run (p =.041), high intensity (p =.023) and explosive (p =.001) distance covered, with run speed and explosive distance significantly decreasing in excessive compared to low environmental heat stress conditions. Similarly, the number of balls lost (p =.002) significantly decreased in excessive compared to low climatic conditions. Total and sprint distances were unaffected. Conclusion: Excessive environmental conditions may impact physical and to some degree technical match-play characteristics. A rational may be due to professional players employing pacing strategies to modulate their physical exertion in an attempt to control thermal strain and physical fatigue.

In this paper, the authors empirically analyze the influence of the gender of the coach on team performance in women's soccer leagues. Moreover, the authors examine the role of initial experience of coaches (as professional players) as an attribute that converges with gender diversity and influence performance. The sample includes the top divisions in France, Germany, and Norway from 2004 to 2017. The results from the regression model show that the gender of the coach is not a significant determinant of team performance (points per game). In addition, the initial experience of coaches does not alter the results. Therefore, managerial decisions of clubs with regard to the employment of coaches should not rely on gender.

Eleven soccer players performed a Yo-Yo Intermittent Recovery Test Level-1 in polluted area (PA) and non-polluted area (NPA). Participants are invited to drink 500 ml of red orange or placebo (PLA) juice 2.5 h before the test. Blood samples were collected at rest and 3 min after each session to assess creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase, malondialdehyde (MDA) and total antioxidant status. Our results showed that, VO2max, heart rate and systolic blood pressure post-exercise were significantly altered by pollution with both supplements, but the damage was lowered more with ROJS than PLA. Concerning muscle damage and oxidative stress markers, orange juice supplementation blunted the effect of pollution on CK levels post-exercise (p > 0.05) and decreases significantly (p < 0.05) the MDA levels post-exercise in PA and NPA compared to PLA supplementation. In conclusion, ROJS seemed to be an appropriate strategy to reduce the risk of exposure to pollution especially on muscle damage and oxidative stress markers.","2019","2020-05-20 00:15:04","2020-05-20 00:15:04","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09603123.2019.1614155; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L627721361","adult; human; article; soccer player; aerobic capacity; exercise; heart rate; controlled study; air pollution; antioxidant; creatine kinase; malonaldehyde; muscle injury; oxidative stress; rest; systolic blood pressure; endogenous compound; protein expression; gene expression; lactate dehydrogenase; orange juice; placebo; protein function","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A controlled study in 126 games","British journal of sports medicine","","1473-0480","10.1136/bjsports-2019-101557","","OBJECTIVES: Most concussions in rugby union occur during tackles. We investigated whether legislating to lower maximum tackle height would change tackle behaviour, and reduce concussion incidence rate. METHODS: In a single group intervention, 12 elite men's teams played in two competitions during the 2019/2020 season. The Championship (control, 90 games) retained standard Laws of Rugby for the tackle; the Championship Cup (intervention, 36 games) used revised laws-the maximum tackle height was lowered from the line of the shoulders on the ball carrier to the line of the armpits. Videos of tackles were analysed for ball carrier and tackler behaviour. Injury data were collected using standardised methods. RESULTS: In the intervention setting, there was a significantly lower proportion of tackles; (1) in which ball carriers (rate ratio (RR) 0.83, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.86) and tacklers (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.84) were upright, (2) in which the tackler's initial contact was to the ball carrier's head or neck (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.84) and (3) in which initial contact was above the line of the ball carrier's armpit (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.88). Concussion incidence rate did not differ between conditions (RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.85 to 2.01). Unexpectedly, compared with the control setting, tacklers in the intervention setting were themselves concussed at a higher rate as measured by; (1) incidence (RR 1.90, 95% CI 1.05 to 3.45) and (2) concussions per 1000 tackles (2.09, 95% CI 1.15 to 3.80) than in the control setting. CONCLUSIONS: Legislating to lower the height of the tackle meant that tacklers made contact with the ball carrier's head and neck 30% less often. This did not influence concussion incidence rates. Tacklers in the intervention setting-who were aiming to tackle lower-suffered more concussions than did tacklers in the control setting.","2019","2020-05-20 00:15:05","2020-05-20 00:15:05","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bjsports-2019-101557; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L630374996","adult; human; male; article; rugby; clinical article; controlled study; incidence; season; competition; concussion; videorecording; accident prevention; shoulder; England; axilla; neck","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: For this descriptive epidemiological study, data was obtained from official NFL gamebooks. In-game injuries were queried for all regular season games from all 32 teams over the course of four seasons (2013 to 2016). Only injuries which resulted in a stoppage of time during gameplay were included. Player position and injured body part were taken from the following week's injury report. Rest periods between games were classified as short (4 days), regular (6-8 days), or long (10+ days) rest. Positions were categorized into Quarterback, Skill (wide receiver, running back and defensive backs), Lineman, and Other (fullback, linebacker and tightend). Overall observed injury rates, as well as injury rates specific to anatomic location and player position, were analyzed in correlation to different rest periods. Statistical significance was determined using the ANOVAprocedure of observed mean injuries per game. Pairwise analysis, through 2 sample T-test, was conducted to assess statistical significance between short, regular and long rest. Results: A total of 2,846 injuries were identified throughout the four seasons. ANOVA testing of all 3 cohorts taken together demonstrated a statistically significant difference between injuries/game between short, regular, and long rest (p = 0.012). With short rest, a mean of 1.26 injuries/game were observed (95% CI 1.046, 1.470), which was statistically significantly different when compared to the 1.53 observed injuries/game with regular rest (95% CI 1.463, 1.601; p = 0.029). Games with short rest were not found to be significantly different when compared to the 1.34 observed injuries/game associated with long rest (95% CI 1.186, 1.486; p = 0.555). Regarding player positions, only the Other cohort achieved statistically significantly less observed injuries/game with games played on Thursday compared to regular (p=0.0002) and long (p = 0.026). The quarterback position was the only position which sustained more injuries than expected with games played on Thursday compared to both regular and long rest; however, these results did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.09). No statistical difference was found regarding injury location in correlation to differences in rest periods. Conclusion: Our data suggests that there is a significant association between the amount of rest between games and observed injuries in the NFL. Interestingly, Thursday night games were found to have fewer injuries per game when compared to games played on regular rest. Subgroup analysis revealed fewer observed injuries with short rest for linebackers, fullbacks, and tightends. Although quarterbacks were observed to have more injuries than expected on short rest, this did not reach statistical significance. The results of this study do not support that less rest associated with Thursday night games leads to higher injury rates; however, quarterback injury rates may potentially be impacted with shortened rest.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine whether headgear reduces the incidence or severity (days out from soccer) of SRCs in soccer players. METHODS: 2766 participants (67% female, age 15.6±1.2) (who undertook 3050 participant years) participated in this cluster randomised trial. Athletes in the headgear (HG) group wore headgear during the season, while those in the no headgear (NoHG) group did not. Staff recorded SRC and non-SRC injuries and soccer exposures. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine time-to-SRC between groups, while severity was compared with a Wilcoxon rank-sum test. RESULTS: 130 participants (5.3% female, 2.2% male) sustained an SRC.

Twenty-six Male and 2 Female participants recruited from 2 high schools between 14 and 18 years of age were followed throughout an entire soccer season. Before the first game and then on 2 separate occasions throughout the season, Osteopathic Examinations took place by 2 Osteopathic physicians to determine specific areas and patterns of somatic dysfunction. Results: Both female participants suffered ankle injuries, while 5 of the male participants suffered knee injuries. Right on Right Sacral Torsion and Posterior Fibular Head demonstrated a statistically significant relationship with lower extremity injuries. Anterior and Posterior rotation of the pelvis as well as Superior Shear of the pelvis did not have a statistically significant relationship. Compensated and Uncompensated Patterns of the Spine, Anterior Fibular head, Left on Left Sacral Torsion, Unilateral Sacral Flexion and Unilateral Sacral Extension were the other somatic dysfunction findings that did not have a statistically significant relationship with lower extremity injuries. Conclusions: Right on Right Sacral Torsion and Posterior Fibular Head were 2 specific somatic dysfunction diagnoses that were significantly associated with lower extremity injuries in the high school soccer player.

Some previous imaging studies have suggested the relationship between presence of scar tissue and risk of re-injury but those are still conflicting evidence. Altered muscle function could be a re-injury risk factor for HSI, and the presence of scar tissue affects muscle function. However, no studies have classified how the size of scar tissue affects muscle function. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to compare the muscle strength between athletes with the larger or smaller size of scar tissue in the hamstring muscles. Methods: Twelve male professional rugby players (age/ height/ weight, 31.33 ± 3.9/181.2 ± 10.5/101 ± 12.46) who have a history of MRI confirmed HSI were selected. The subjects were divided into two groups as follows. Group A; (n = 4) the length of scar tissue was below 100 mm, and group B; (n = 8) length of scar tissue was above 100 mm. Muscle strength was measured using BIODEX System (Biodex Medical Systems, Inc.).The measurements were taken at 60 and 180 degrees(isokinetic), 60, 90, and 180 degrees (isometric) for both hamstring and quadriceps muscle. Strength ratios of affected to unaffected legs and hamstring to quadriceps were calculated. Statistical analysis involved Fisher's exact test, unpaired T test, and Mann-Whitney U test. Results: In our study, the only statistically significant difference was the ratio for the affected to unaffected leg in 180 degrees isokinetic contraction in which the Group A was fewer than the Group B, (97.6Nm ± 5.6:88.3Nm ± 6.2), p = 0.024. However, all other measurements showed that the size of scar tissue was not related to muscle strength between Group A and B, p = 0.54. Discussion: Overall examination shows that the size of scar tissue is not statistically related to muscle strength. However, according to previous biomechanical studies HSI occurs especially in late swing phase. In addition, hamstring muscles are the most lengthened position as an eccentric contraction in this phase. Therefore, even though overall muscle strength is recovered, weakened 180 degrees muscle strength may be considered clinically important and modifiable risk factor of recurrent HSI. All in all, the larger scar tissue affects more on muscle strength only in the lengthened position of hamstring muscle.

However, support limb behavior when shooting in a futsal context was not previously investigated, and its potential role on such discrepant motor outputs is still unclear. Thus, the study aimed to compare kinematic features of the support limb and approach run between kicking a stationary and a rolling ball using dominant and non-dominant limbs. METHODS: Ten futsal players participated (21.88±2.86 years-old, 73.66±4.17 kg and 1.75±0.04 m) and performed kicks (five per limb per condition) with the dominant and non-dominant limbs in stationary and rolling ball conditions. Kinematic analysis comprised determination of support limb angular joint (hip, knee and ankle) displacement and velocity, approach run distance, angle, linear velocity, step length and width, support foot-to-ball distance, ball velocity (120 Hz) and accuracy (60 Hz). RESULTS: Hip adjustments (greater extension) in the support limb when kicking a rolling ball contributed in maintaining similar performance (e.g., ball velocity) to kicking a stationary ball, compensating for the lower approach run velocity and longer support foot to ball distance. Kicking with the non-dominant limb demonstrated a lower approach run velocity and the non-dominant support limb presented different angular motion compared to the dominant support limb in hip (< internal rotation), knee (< flexion), and ankle joints (< plantar flexion), being harmful to performance in both kicking stationary and rolling balls. CONCLUSIONS: Kicking a stationary and rolling ball presented similar performance, but compared to the dominant side, futsal instep kicks performed with the non-dominant support limb induces lower approach run velocity and inefficient angular joint motion, either harmful to performance output.","2019","2020-05-20 00:15:19","2020-05-20 00:15:19","","1852-1860","","11","59","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L627710581; http://dx.doi.org/10.23736/S0022-4707.19.09654-3","adult; human; male; lower limb; hip; knee; biomechanics; sport; athlete; young adult; physiology; ankle; rotation; athletic performance; joint characteristics and functions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Dose-response relationship between internal training load and changes in performance during the preseason in youth soccer players. J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2019-The aim of this study was to describe training intensity distribution based on the session rating of perceived exertion (sRPE) and heart rate (HR) methods and examine the dose-response relation between internal training load (ITL) and change in performance of 16 youth soccer players (mean ± SD age: 18.75 ± 0.68 years, height: 175.3 ± 5.5 cm, body mass: 68.7 ± 6.5 kg, and body fat: 10.7 ± 1.2%) belonging to a Brazilian first division team during a 3-week preseason. The sRPE and HR data were registered daily to calculate the ITL and the training intensity distribution, in 3 intensity zones (low, moderate, and high). The Yo-yo Intermittent Recovery Level 1 (Yo-yo IR1) was evaluated before and after experimental period. The total time spent in the low-intensity zone (HR method) was greater (p < 0.01) compared with the moderate- and high-intensity zones. No difference was observed between training intensity zones determined by the sRPE method (p > 0.05). Negative correlations were observed between weekly mean sRPE-TL (r = -0.69), Edward's-TL (r = -0.50), and change in Yo-yo IR1. Linear regression indicated that weekly mean sRPE-TL (F1;14 = 13.3; p < 0.01) and Edward's-TL (F1;14 = 4.8; p < 0.05) predicted 48.7 and 25.5% of the variance in performance change, respectively. Stepwise linear regression revealed that these 2-predictor variables (F2;13 = 18.9; p < 0.001) explained 74.5% of the variance in performance change. The results suggest that the sRPE and HR methods cannot be used interchangeably to determine training intensity distribution. Moreover, sRPE-TL seems to be more effective than the HR-based TL method to predict changes in performance in youth soccer players.","2019","2020-05-20 00:15:22","2020-05-20 00:15:22","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1519/JSC.0000000000003126; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L627504671","adult; human; article; soccer player; exercise; heart rate; controlled study; young adult; juvenile; height; body fat; dose response; linear regression analysis; predictor variable","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Twenty-five male players were recruited from the Londrina Junior Team Football Academy in Brazil and asked to either dribble the ball or sprint through five custom circuits that varied in average curvature (0-1.37 radians.m-1). These measures were then validated using a realistic one vs. one competition in which each player acted as attacker or defender in turn (N = 1330 bouts). Sprinting (ICC = 0.96) and dribbling (ICC = 0.97) performances were highly repeatable for individual players. Average dribbling speed decreased non-linearly with increasing circuit curvature (F = 239.5; P < 0.001) from 5.19 ± 0.11 ms-1 on the straightest path to 2.13 ± 0.03 ms-1 on the curviest. Overall, dribbling but not sprinting performance predicted attacking success in the one vs. one competition, explaining more than 50% of the variation in attacking success alone (rp = 0.70; P < 0.001). In conclusion, our new closed-skill dribbling assessment is a valid and reliable protocol to predict a soccer player's success in attacking performance in one vs. one situation, and can be used to identify talented players.","2019","2020-05-20 00:15:23","2020-05-20 00:15:23","","1072-1079","","9","37","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02640414.2018.1544110; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L627118930","human; male; soccer; adolescent; running; aptitude; athletic performance; task performance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A total of 32,083 impacts were recorded across 2 years of practices. Precise tracking of instrumented athletes, head impacts, and drill participation allowed quantification of hits sustained per person per minute (H/P/M) for each specific drill. We found significant H/P/M variability between 14 drills and player position, ranging from 0.02 to 0.41 H/P/M for Linemen and 0.01 to 0.15 H/P/M for Non-Linemen. Impact magnitude data are also reported for practice term (Spring, Training Camp, In-Season) and dress-type (Helmets Only, Spyders, Shells, Full Pads). Recommendations for shortening high-risk drills, based on H/P/M drill impact frequencies, suggest possible “friendly fire” reductions of 1000 impacts for Linemen and 300 impacts for Non-Linemen over their collegiate career. Over 80% of potentially avoidable head impacts were attributable to just three drills—“Team Run,” “Move the Field,” and “Team.” Recommending drill-specific modifications based on practical considerations (the drill’s impact frequency, dress-types when performing the drill, and duration) could improve acceptance from coaches and efficiently reduce head impact exposure without drastically altering overall practice structure.","2019","2020-05-20 00:15:24","2020-05-20 00:15:24","","2094-2108","","10","47","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L622976613; http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10439-018-2088-5","adult; football player; human; article; football; biomechanics; priority journal; controlled study; training; concussion; helmet; student athlete; head; spring; high risk behavior; telemetry; exposure; frequency; head impact telemetry system; risk reduction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Forty-five Australian rules footballers underwent six DXA scans across a 12-month period (off-season [OS, Week 0-13], early [PS1, Week 13-22] and late pre-season [PS2, Week 22-31] and early [IS1, Week 31-42) and late in-season [IS2, Week 42-51]). EB (kcal·day-1) was estimated from changes in fat free soft tissue mass (FFSTM) and fat mass (FM) between scans according to a validated formula. An EB threshold of ±123 kcal·day-1 for >60 days demonstrated a very likely (>95% probability) change in FFSTM (>1.0 kg) and FM (>0.7 kg). There were small to almost perfect relationships between EB and changes in FM (r=0.97, 95% CI, 0.96 to 0.98), FFSTM (r=-0.41, -0.92 to -0.52) and body mass (r=0.27, 0.14 to 0.40). EB was lowest during PS1 compared to all other phases (range, -265 to -142 kcal·day-1), with no other changes at any time. Increases in FFSTM were higher during OS compared to PS2 (1.6 ±0.4 kg), and higher during PS1 compared to PS2, IS1, and IS2 (range, 1.6 to 2.1 kg). There were no changes during in-season (-0.1 to 0.05 kg). FM decreased only in PS1 compared to all other seasonal phases (-1.8 to -1.0 kg).

The primary purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between dynamic postural stability as measured by the Star Excursion Balance Test (SEBT) and static postural sway assessment as measured by the TechnoBody™ Pro-Kin in female soccer players. A secondary purpose was to determine side-to-side symmetry in this cohort. Methods: A total of 18 female soccer players completed testing on the SEBT and Technobody™ Pro-Kin balance device. Outcome measures were anterior, posterior medial, and posterior lateral reaches from the SEBT and center of pressure in the x- and y-axes as well as SD of movement in the forward/backward and medial/lateral directions from the force plate on left and right legs. Bivariate correlations were determined between the 8 measures. In addition, paired Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were performed to determine similarity between limb scores. Results: All measures on both the SEBT and postural sway assessment were significantly correlated when comparing dominant with nondominant lower-extremities with the exception of SD of movement in both x- and y-axes. When correlating results of the SEBT with postural sway assessment, a significant correlation was found between the SEBT right lower-extremity posterior lateral reach (r = .567, P < .05) and summed SEBT (r = .486, P < .05) and the center of pressure in the y-axis. A significant correlation was also found on the left lower-extremity, with SD of forward/backward movement and SEBT posterior medial reach (r = -.511, P < .05).

Post-hoc analysis demonstrated that backs had a longer normalised reach distance, with medium-large and small-medium effect sizes for the under-20 and senior cohorts respectively. The one-way ANCOVA analysis suggests that this difference is likely due to the larger differences in player body mass between forward and back playing positions.

Research question: What effect does the use of differing static and functional knee axis orientation methods have on the observed knee angle outputs for the activities of gait, overhead squatting and a hurdle step? Methods: A pre-existing dataset collected from one season (September 2015–May 2016) as part of a prospective observational longitudinal study was used. A secondary analysis of data for 24 male footballers, from a single British University football team, was conducted in order to evaluate the effect of static (conventional gait model) and dynamic (constrained and unconstrained mDynaKAD) methods on knee joint kinematics for flexion-extension and valgus-varus angles. Results: No single calibration method consistently achieved both the highest flexion and lowest valgus angle for all tests. The constrained and unconstrained mDynaKAD methods achieved superior alignment of the knee medio-lateral axis compared to the conventional gait model, when the movement activity served as its own calibration. The largest mean difference between methods for sagittal and coronal plane kinematics was less than 4° and 14° respectively. Cross-talk could not account for all variation within the results, highlighting that soft tissue artefact, associated with larger muscle volumes and movements, can influence kinematics results. Significance: When considering the trade-off between achieving maximum flexion and minimal valgus angle, the results indicate that the mDynaKAD methods performed best when the selected movement activity served as its own calibration method for all activities. Clinical decision making processes obtained through use of these methods should be considered in light of the model errors associated with cross-talk and effect of soft tissue artefact.","2019","2020-05-20 00:15:32","2020-05-20 00:15:32","","298-304","","","70","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gaitpost.2019.03.006; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2001733826","football player; human; male; article; clinical article; observational study; priority journal; adolescent; longitudinal study; knee function; muscle mass; soft tissue; secondary analysis; kinematics; gait; movement (physiology); valgus knee; artifact; calibration; dynamic knee valgus; hurdle step; overhead squat; screening test","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Nineteen male soccer players (age: 18±0.88 years, body-mass: 69.85±7.68 kg, body-height: 1.75±0.07 m, body-mass-index: 22.87±2.23 kg·m-2 and body-fat-percentage: 12.53±2.59 %), completed the following loaded warm-up protocols in a randomized, counterbalanced cross-over, within participants order and on separate days: weighted-vest with a loading of 5% (WUV5%), 10% (WUV10%), 15% (WUV15%) body-mass, and an unloaded condition (control). RCOD performance (total time, peak time and fatigue index) was collected during the pre-intervention phase (5 min after the dynamic stretching sequence) for baseline values and immediately (at 15ths), at the 4th and 8th min post-warm-up intervention. RESULTS: For each post-warm-up tested, recovery-times (i.e., 15-s, 4-min, and 8-min), both total, and peak times were faster following WUV5%, WUV10%, and WUV15%, compared to the unloaded condition (P [<0.001-0.031], d [1.28-2.31] [large]). There were no significant differences (P [0.09-1.00], d [0.03-0.72] [trivial-moderate]) in-between recovery times in both total and peak times following WUV5%, WUV10% and WUV15%. However, baseline fatigue index score was significantly worse than all other scores (P [<0.001-0.002], d [1.35-2.46] [large]) following the loaded conditions. CONCLUSIONS: The findings demonstrated that a dynamic loaded warm-up increases an athlete's initial RCOD performance up to the 8th min post-warm-up intervention. Therefore, strength coaches need to consider using weighted-vests during the warm-up for trained athletes in order to acutely optimize RCODs.","2019","2020-05-20 00:15:35","2020-05-20 00:15:35","","1-28","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1123/ijspp.2018-0800; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L627870692","adult; human; human experiment; male; article; soccer player; controlled study; body mass; young adult; randomized controlled trial; warm up; agility; fatigue; body height; body fat","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of the research was to provide a comparative characteristic of the dynamics of psychophysiological functions and indicators of physical and technical readiness of young footballers aged 12-13 and 15-16 years during 3 months of training. Methods. The study involved 24 football players; 12 were 12-13 years old, 12 were 15-16 years old. Parameters characteristic of determining the psychophysiological status, indicators of the nervous system work capacity, and attention indicators were analysed with the help of computer programs for psychophysiological testing. Also, the level of physical preparedness (60-m running, 1000-m running, shuttle running, pull-ups, standing long jump), and of technical preparedness (juggling, running throw) were established. Testing was carried out at the beginning of the preparatory period and at the beginning of the competition period of an annual training process cycle. The gap between the tests was 3 months. Results. Changes of psychophysiological indicators and indicators of physical and technical fitness that occurred in the observed period were more expressed among the 12-13 years old football players than in those aged 15-16 years. Conclusions. At the age of 12-13 years, emphasis should be put on the development of psychophysiological functions since at an older age the level of these functions is more difficult to influence, which can be decisive for the perfection of the athlete in football.","2019","2020-05-20 00:15:36","2020-05-20 00:15:36","","20-27","","3","27","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.5114/pq.2019.86464; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2003284958","football player; human; article; competition; adolescent; running; attention; child; school child; aged; software; nervous system","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Eight male soccer players (21-39 years) completed an incremental exercise test (40 W every 4 minutes) to exhaustion on a cycle ergometer. VO2 and the VCO2 were measured for each single workload. Additionally, pCO2, pO2, pH and lactate were measured by blood gas analysis from the hyperemized ear lobe, allowing the calculation of the bicarbonate concentration and of the total volume of CO2 dissolved in one liter of plasma at the end of each workload. Taking into account a CO2 distribution volume of 25% of the bodyweight, the CO2 solved in the extracellular compartment (CO2ECS) of the body could be calculated. Changes of the volume of CO2ECS were subtracted from the VO2. Thus a corrected RER could be obtained. RESULTS: While RER showed the typical increase when the load was increased, corrected RER did not show any significant change up to maximal load. CONCLUSIONS: The total amount of fatty acids oxidized increases continuously up to the maximal load. Results from others, who interpret the increased volume of VCO2 seen, when the load is augmented, as a result of a decreased oxidation of fatty acids are due to a neglect of the volume of VCO2, which results from buffering lactate.","2019","2020-05-20 00:15:39","2020-05-20 00:15:39","","729-735","","10","178","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2004835905; http://dx.doi.org/10.23736/S0393-3660.18.03820-2","adult; human; human experiment; male; article; soccer player; oxygen consumption; workload; blood sampling; normal human; exercise test; respiratory tract parameters; energy expenditure; lactic acid; lactate blood level; arterial gas; bicarbonate; bicarbonate blood level; bicycle ergometer; bicycle ergometry; blood gas analysis; breathing rate; calorie; carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide release; Corival; corrected respiratory exchange ratio; ear lobe; ergometer; fatty acid oxidation; glucose oxidation; indirect calorimetry; lung gas exchange; metabolic acidosis; Metamax; oxygen tension; pH; spiroergometer; spiroergometry","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Case-control. Elite ARF Women's competition. Eighty-four elite female ARF players (mean age, 25 ± 4.9 years; height, 1.71 ± 0.73 m; weight, 67 kg ± 7.4 kg) with (n = 12) and without (n = 72) a history of unilateral ACLR in the previous 10 years. Peak eccentric knee flexor force during the Nordic hamstring exercise (NHE). Players with a history of unilateral ACLR displayed lower levels of eccentric knee flexor strength in their surgically reconstructed limb than their uninjured contralateral limb (mean difference −53.77 N, 95% CI = −85.06 to −24.27, d = −0.51) and compared to the limbs of players with no history of injury (mean difference = −46.32 N, 95% CI = −86.65 to −11.13, d = −0.73). Elite female ARF players with a history of unilateral ACLR display deficits in eccentric knee flexor strength in their surgically reconstructed limb for up to 10 years following surgery. • Elite female ARF players display deficits in eccentric knee flexor strength 1-10 years post-ACLR compared to uninjured limbs. • Conventional rehabilitation may not adequately restore knee flexor strength to the ACLR limb. • Future research should explore if hamstring strength deficits are a risk factor for ACL re-injury.

However, the learning curve for practicing physicians remains an area of concern & the ECG patterns that are typically classified as Not Normal by physicians have not been systematically analyzed. Methods: 1,314 athletes from 2012-15 underwent ECG screening prior to participation in the National Football League combine. Formal interpretation standards were evolving over this period & criteria used were at the discretion of the physician. ECGs were retrospectively reviewed by 2 cardiologists with expertise in sports cardiology using the IC. “Common themes” of ECG patterns were identified upon application of IC that resulted in a change from initial read. Results: Applying the IC reduced the number of participants with abnormal ECG findings from 198 (15.1%) to 69 (5.3%). 16 “common themes” (Table) were identified that contributed to reclassification of the initial interpretation. Some form of T-wave abnormality accounted for 35% of those “common themes”. Conclusion: Modern athlete ECG interpretation criteria have evolved rapidly & physician education is important. Compared to using the IC, this real-world analysis revealed a high initial abnormal rate & identified “common themes” leading to Not Normal ECGs. These provide a potential opportunity to design more specific educational programs to improve athlete ECG interpretation.

Due to a large diagnostic grey-zone, Left Ventricular Non-Compaction Cardiomyopathy (LVNC) is an entity quite challenging to diagnose, particularly in athletes from Afro-Caribbean descent. Purpose: The aim of the study was to assess the currently established echocardiographic diagnostic criteria for LVNC in a cohort of adolescent African football players of relatively homogenous ethnic descent. Methods: The study took place in the West-African sub-Saharan country of Gabon were the ethnic background of its population is relatively homogenous. The competitive football players underwent cardiac screening, including personal and family history, physical examination, 12-lead resting ECG and transthoracic echocardiography, that particularly assessed the three currently established diagnostic echocardiographic criteria to diagnose LVNC (Jenni-, Chin- and Stollberger-Criteria). Results: The mean age of the 210 male athletes was 18.6 years (range 18-22). Family history revealed sudden or unexplained death in 17%. Most of the cases concerned athletes without an echocardiographic LVNC pattern. Clearly suspicious ECG findings were unexpectedly rare, with Twave inversions in 7 athletes (3.3%) and ST-segment depression in 1 athlete (0.5%). All ECG changes but two were seen in athletes with positive echocardiographic criteria for LVNC. The number of athletes exhibiting at least one of the established echocardiographic criteria for LVNC was very high (n=83, 39.5%). All of these 83 athletes were positive for the Chin criteria (100%), while 41 athletes showed positive criteria for Stollberger (49.3%, 19.5% overall) and 21 for Jenni (25.3%, 4.8% overall) criteria. In not less than 17 athletes all three currently established diagnostic criteria were positive (20.5%, 8.1% overall). The LV systolic function was normal in all athletes. Conclusions: In adolescent African football players from relatively homogenous ethnic background, the prevalence of positive echocardiographic diagnostic criteria for LVNC is unexpectedly high. Almost 40% of the athletes fulfill at least one of the established diagnostic criteria. Thus, these established criteria should not be used routinely for a population of black athletes. The estimation, which of the three diagnostic sets may be the most accurate is not conclusive, however, it is remarkable that the 'Chin' criteria were positive in all players with LVNC pattern, while the 'Jenni' criteria were positive in only 25%. In 8.1% of the overall cohort all three diagnostic criteria were positive, making these athletes most likely to have the definite diagnosis. At a nine year follow-up there were no adverse or fatal events reported. More studies, which should integrate cardiac MRI, are needed to improve diagnostic accuracy of these morphologic findings.","2019","2020-05-20 00:15:44","2020-05-20 00:15:44","","104","","","40","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehz747.0141; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L630050936","conference abstract; football player; human; male; major clinical study; adolescent; cohort analysis; follow up; prevalence; diagnostic test accuracy study; sudden cardiac death; transthoracic echocardiography; physical examination; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; ventricular noncompaction; fatality; diagnosis; family history; chin; diagnostic accuracy; Gabon; ST segment depression","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We aimed to asses gender differences in cardiac remodeling of elite male and female soccer players before seasonal training; athletes were homogenous for lifestyle, load and type of training. We also studied its temporal progression in male athletes over a regular season. METHODS: A cross-sectional study examined gender differences in cardiac remodeling of 55 professional soccer players compared to 39 paired controls at baseline conditions. A 6-month longitudinal study aimed to asses the impact of training on athletes’ heart of 17 male players. Athletes were examined with 2D and speckle tracking echocardiography before and during the regular season. RESULTS: All subjects showed values within the normal range. Male and female athletes showed a significant increase, compared to controls, of wall thickness (WT: 10.44±0.96 vs 9.29±0.66, p<0.001; 8.78±0.84 vs 8.29±0.57, p=0.04), indexed cardiac mass (iCM: 95.93±14.62 vs 82.82±9.73, p<0.001; 123.67±21.97 vs 98.62±11.82, p<0.001), and ejection fraction (EF; 60.69±5.59 vs 56.68±3.54, p=0.01; 62.06±6.33 vs 57.32±5.52, p=0.02); male athletes showed a significant increase in left ventricular diastolic volume (122.50 ±21.41 vs 102.99±22.08; p<0,001), while female athletes had higher global longitudinal strain (GLS) compared to female controls (-26.52±4.1 vs -23.5±2.8, p=0.01) and global male study population. No significant differences were observed in right ventricle remodeling and GLS. Multiple linear regression showed a correlation between both sex and training, and cardiac remodeling. Athletes followed up for 6-month showed significant reduction in EF (60.69±5.59 vs 55.59±7.20, p=0.005) and in GLS (-24.27±3.4 vs -20.78±2.21, p<0.001) compared to basal measurements, but no significant differences in WT, iCM and ventricular volumes. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac remodeling in athletes is a balanced physiological phenomenon occurring in both sexes and is more pronounced in males; however, women seem to have higher GLS independently of training. Seasonal training is associated with normal cardiac function, increased mass and volumes, and reduced EF and GLS. These findings suggest that exercise-induced cardiac remodeling is complex and classic cardiac hypertrophy is not the only feature happening: athlete's heart adapts to exercise decreasing basal function to be more efficient during effort.","2019","2020-05-20 00:15:46","2020-05-20 00:15:46","","B76","","6","32","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.echo.2019.04.414; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2003682807","adult; conference abstract; female; human; male; soccer player; exercise; controlled study; season; sex difference; body weight; cross-sectional study; longitudinal study; heart left ventricle; heart right ventricle; heart ventricle remodeling; thickness; heart ejection fraction; heart hypertrophy; lifestyle; physiological process; speckle tracking echocardiography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Twenty-eight young male outfield soccer players (age 11.1 ± 0.9 years, height 142 ± 4.4 cm, body mass 37.0 ± 5.9 kg) with at least 2 years of experience in soccer competitions were tested twice using YYIR1C and an age-adapted competitive small-sided game (i.e., 9v9), 7 days apart in a random order. The YYIR1C performance showed an excellent relative (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.94) and a good absolute reliability (typical error of measurement as percentage of the coefficient of variation = 5.1%). Very large and significant associations were found between YYIR1C performance and match high-intensity activity (r = 0.53). Large correlations were found between YYIR1C and match sprinting (r = 0.42) and high-intensity metabolic power (r = 0.46) distances. Match total distance was largely associated with YYIR1C (r = 0.30). The results of this study showed that YYIR1C may be considered a valid and reliable field test for assessing intermittent high-intensity endurance in young male soccer players.

Youth soccer players (n = 16) were the participants of the study. To assess anxiety state, participants completed the Sport Competition Anxiety Test. The EEG was recorded using single-channel mobile EEG system on the prefrontal cortex. Regression model was used to analyze EEG rhythms as predictor of anxiety by cross-sectional study. Regression analyses revealed that the indicator of eyes-open condition based on delta rhythm is the predictor with positive slope to the prediction of the level of competitive anxiety (P ≤ 0.01). The indicator of eyes-closed condition based on theta rhythm is the predictor with negative slope to the prediction of the level of competitive anxiety (P ≤ 0.03). The findings are interpreted to suggest that delta and theta rhythms are a plausible neurobiological index of anxiety and can distinguish anxiety in sport competition. A slow EEG oscillation predicts formation of competitive anxiety in soccer players and appears to reflect the mechanism of the defensive inhibition in prefrontal cortex to competitive anxiety. Application of the portable EEG system may provide an efficient and valid predictor of emotional state of soccer players.","2019","2020-05-20 00:15:49","2020-05-20 00:15:49","","203-208","","4","2","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L627061229; http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/tsm2.72","human; article; soccer player; clinical article; controlled study; sport; competition; prediction; juvenile; cross-sectional study; anxiety; eye; delta rhythm; oscillation; prefrontal cortex; regression analysis; theta rhythm","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Revista Internacional de Ciencias del Deporte","","18853137","","","Soccer refereeing demand a high neuromuscular implication which it could produce accumulative fatigue and keep down the physical performance of soccer referees. The aims of this study were 1) to describe the performance in an incremental maximum test and in the bilateral and unilateral vertical jump (VJ) capacity in soccer referees, and 2) to analyze the variation on the VJ capacity after performing a maximum incremental test. Before and after performing a cardiovascular incremental test, VJ capacity was measured in 12 high-level soccer referees who officiated at high Spanish competitive-level. On one side, post activation potentiation (PAP) effect was not produced because the improvement of VJ was trivial-small (p > 0,05; Δ = 0,10-2,19%; d = 0,01-0,21). On the other side, due to the associations between VJ variation and maximum values on the incremental test were small in many cases (r=- 0,25/0,24), it could happen that the fatigue induced by the incremental maximum test is not associated to a loss of performance in the vertical jump capacity in high-level soccer referees. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR El arbitraje en el fútbol demanda una elevada implicación neuromuscular que puede producir un importante acúmulo de fatiga y limitar el rendimiento físico de los árbitros. Los objetivos de este estudio fueron: 1) describir el rendimiento en un test incremental en tapiz y en la capacidad de salto vertical (SV) bilateral y unilateral de árbitros de fútbol y 2) analizar la variación en la capacidad de SV, después de realizar un test incremental máximo de resistencia con respecto a los valores iniciales. Antes y después de la realización de una prueba incremental en tapiz de laboratorio, se midió la capacidad de SV de 12 árbitros de fútbol de alto nivel que arbitraban en las categorías de mayor nivel del futbol español. Por un lado, no se produjo el efecto potenciación post activación (PAP) ya que la mejora de la capacidad de SV fue trivial-baja (p > 0,05; Δ = 0,10-2,19%; d = 0,01-0,21). Por otro lado, debido a que las asociaciones entre la variación de SV y los valores máximos en el test incremental fueron en la mayor parte de los casos bajas (r=-0,25/0,24), no parece evidenciarse que la fatiga producida en el test máximo incremental esté asociada a una pérdida de rendimiento en la capacidad de salto en los árbitros de fútbol de alto nivel.

The occurrence of injuries has a negative impact not only on individual athletes but also on the whole team and is a burden to society. The level of prevention is directly proportional to the education of coaches, who are the key persons in delivering preventive programmes to players. Objective: The aim of the paper was to identify the effect of a one-day workshop on the attitudes of amateur-level youth football coaches to the injury prevention programme, its implementation in the training process, and its sustainability over time. Methods: A ""RE-AIM"" questionnaire was developed to assess the views of coaches 6 months after attending an injury prevention workshop. A total of 112 coaches were addressed, 22 of whom completed the questionnaire. Results: A positive effect of a one-day workshop on coaches' attitudes on injury prevention was observed. All coaches have incorporated prevention programs into the training process. More than half of the coaches use prevention programs at least once a week. The use of injury prevention features was maintained even six months after the seminar. Conclusions: A workshop consisting of a theoretical and practical part can be considered an effective tool in coach education in the context of injury prevention.

Sixty-seven soccer players (mean age ± SD 23.4 ± 5.2 years) that were following a supervised training program participated in this study. Players were tested twice: immediately after the conclusion of the competition period, and following the detraining period, for the determination of bone-turnover rates, ergometrics, and components of the HPG-axis. The detraining period resulted in significant reduction in osteocalcin [OC] (p < 0.001), C-terminal propeptide of collagen type-I [CICP] (p = 0.002), and bone-alkaline-phosphatase [b-ALP] (p < 0.001) values, while C-terminal telopeptide [CTX] was increased (p < 0.001). No significant relationships were apparent between bone biomarkers and body weight, body-fat %, total testosterone, free testosterone, estradiol, follicle-stimulating hormone, and luteinizing hormone in both experimental sessions (p > 0.05). Similarly, despite the deterioration in ergometrics after detraining (all p < 0.001), no significant correlations were evident (p > 0.05) between bone biomarkers and maximal oxygen consumption, squat jump, countermovement jump, and 20 m sprint performance, and also between % change of bone biomarkers and ergometrics, apart from a weak relationship (p = 0.041) between OC and VO2max of questionable value. Our results suggest that the 6-week soccer off-season detraining period in our study negatively affected bone physiology as reflected by the suppression of bone-formation rate and a parallel induction of bone resorption. The cause of this acute alteration of bone-turnover rates is not related to the examined components of the HPG-axis, although parallels is not associated with the changes in ergometrics.","2019","2020-05-20 00:15:54","2020-05-20 00:15:54","","512-519","","3","37","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","","","","https://gateway.library.qut.edu.au/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=c8h&AN=136187735&site=ehost-live&scope=site","Adult; Male; Soccer; Adolescence; Athletes; Body Composition; Bone and Bones -- Metabolism; Bone Remodeling; Ergometry; Gonads -- Metabolism; Hypothalamus -- Metabolism; Sex Hormones -- Metabolism; Young Adult","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Alison; Hetzel, Scott; McGuine, Timothy A.","Effect of a New Rule Limiting Full Contact Practice on the Incidence of Sport-Related Concussion in High School Football Players","American Journal of Sports Medicine","","03635465","","","Background: Sport-related concussion (SRC) has been associated with cognitive impairment, depression, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy. American football is the most popular sport among males in the United States and has one of the highest concussion rates among high school sports. Measured head impacts and concussions are approximately 4 times more common in contact practices compared with noncontact practices. The Wisconsin Interscholastic Athletic Association passed new rules defining and limiting contact during practice before the 2014 football season. Purpose: To determine if the SRC rate is lower after a rule change that limited the amount and duration of full-contact activities during high school football practice sessions. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: A total of 2081 high school football athletes enrolled and participated in the study in 2012-2013 (before the rule change), and 945 players participated in the study in 2014 (after the rule change). Players self-reported previous concussion and demographic information. Athletic trainers recorded athlete exposures (AEs), concussion incidence, and days lost for each SRC. Chi-square tests were used to compare the incidence of SRC in prerule 2012-2013 seasons with the incidence in the postrule 2014 season. Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used to determine differences in days lost because of SRC. Results: A total of 67 players (7.1%) sustained 70 SRCs in 2014. The overall rate of SRC per 1000 AEs was 1.28 in 2014 as compared with 1.58 in 2012-2013 (P =.139). The rate of SRC sustained overall in practice was significantly lower (P =.003) after the rule change in 2014 (15 SRCs, 0.33 per 1000 AEs) as compared with prerule 2012-2013 (86 SRCs, 0.76 per 1000 AEs). There was no difference (P =.999) in the rate of SRC sustained in games before (5.81 per 1000 AEs) and after (5.74 per 1000 AEs) the rule change. There was no difference (P =.967) in days lost from SRC before (13 days lost [interquartile range, 10-18]) and after (14 days lost [interquartile range, 10-16]) the rule change. Conclusion: The rate of SRC sustained in high school football practice decreased by 57% after a rule change limiting the amount and duration of full-contact activities, with no change in competition concussion rate. Limitations on contact during high school football practice may be one effective measure to reduce the incidence of SRC.

This study aimed to investigate whether RF strain injury affected the region-specific functional role of the muscle. We studied seven soccer players with a history of unilateral RF strain injury. Injury data were obtained from a questionnaire survey and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Multichannel surface electromyographic (SEMG) signals were recorded from the proximal to distal regions of the RF with 24 electrodes during isometric knee extension and hip flexion. The SEMG signals of each channel during hip flexion were normalised by those during knee extension for the injured and non-injured RF (HF/KE), and compared among the proximal, middle, and distal regions. Six RF strain injuries showed a low signal area in MRI. There was no significant difference in muscle strength between the injured and non-injured RF. While the HF/KE in the proximal region was significantly higher than those in the middle and distal regions in the non-injured RF, a difference in the HF/KE was seen only between the proximal and distal regions of the injured RF. Furthermore, the HF/KE of the most proximal channel in the injured RF was significantly lower than that in the non-injured RF. However, there was no significant difference between injured and non-injured areas in the HF/KE. Our findings suggest that the region-specific functional role of the RF muscle is partly affected by RF strain injury.

The current study aimed to determine the effect of a skills specific coaching education programme on the skill level of mini-rugby players in the Western Province Rugby Union. The participants of this study consisted of coaches (N=6) and players (N=181) from different primary schools in Cape Town, Western Cape Province, South Africa. The schools were selected based on the mini-rugby structure at the schools, to ensure a uniform environment between the experimental and control groups. Two of the four schools were randomly allocated to the experimental group (n=84) and the other two schools were randomly allocated to the control group (n=97). After being exposed to the 16-week skills programme, the experimental group, when compared to the control group, showed significant improvements (p<0.05) in five of the six skills (passing, catching, picking up the ball, tackling and taking the ball into contact). Although the control group improved in three of the skills, the improvements were not significant (p>0.05).

Aim: The aim of this study is to determine the effect of acute L-arginine supplementation on repeated sprint ability performance in football players aged between 18-21 years. Methods: The study was conducted on 20 volunteer healthy male football players playing in the under-21 football team in the 1st league of Turkey. General characteristics of football players were questioned and their anthropometric measurements were taken. The study was performed as a double-blind placebo-controlled design. Players were randomly given 0.15 g/kg/day relative dosage L-arginine or placebo with 500 ml of water 1 hour before repeated sprint ability test (RSAT). The 12x20m RSAT protocol was applied in the synthetic turf football field with a recovery interval of 30 seconds between each sprint and the photocell system was used to determine running time. Results: The mean age of the arginine group is 18.30±0.48 years and the mean age of placebo group is 18.33±0.50 years. 85% of the players never used L-arginine, and any dietary supplements. Only the ninth sprint time of the 12 sprints performed after the supplementation was 5.24% faster than the placebo group in the arginine group (p<0.05). However, no difference was detected between the groups in terms of sprint decrement score, total sprint time, blood pressure and heart rate (HR) (p>0.05). Conclusion: In this study, the supplementation of acute L-arginine administered to players had no significant effect on HR, blood pressure and RSAT total sprint time and sprint decrement score.","2019","2020-05-20 00:16:01","2020-05-20 00:16:01","","5-11","","1","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.23751/pn.v21i1.7497; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2001687305","adult; football player; human; human experiment; male; article; heart rate; controlled study; running; blood pressure; normal human; dietary supplement; placebo; anthropometric parameters; arginine; Turkey (republic)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Risk factors and modifiers of the clinical and pathological expression of CTE are not well understood. African American (AA) race increases risk for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AA race may have similar effects in the setting of CTE. This study compared AA and Caucasian symptomatic former National Football League (NFL) players on neurobehavioral outcomes, structural MRI indices, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of total tau (t-tau), phosphorylated tau (p=tau), and Aβ. Methods: Ninety-five symptomatic former NFL players (ages 40-69; n=42 AA, n=53 Caucasians) underwent neurobehavioral testing, structural MRI, and lumbar puncture to quantify CSF t-tau, and p-tau181, Aβ1-42using immunoassays. Principal component analysis generated behavior/mood, psychomotor speed/executive function, and verbal and visual memory factor scores. FreeSurfer derived volumetric output. The cumulative head impact index (CHII) estimated RHI. Linear regressions examined the effect of AA on each neurobehavioral, structural MRI, and CSF variable, controlling for age, BMI, and the CHII (and intracranial volume for structural MRI, and education for neurobehavioral analyses). Sample sizes varied due to missing data (n=84-86). Results: Compared to Caucasians, AA had a higher BMI (p=0.017) and were three years younger (p=0.025). There were no differences in education or years of play. Compared to Caucasians, AA exhibited worse psychomotor speed/executive function (t=-4.33, p<0.001), had greater white matter hypointensity burden (t=2.96, p=0.004), and smaller volume of the right hippocampus (t=2.97, p=0.004), cortical white matter (t=-2.69, p=0.009), and total gray matter (t=4.51, p<0.001). AA had a higher p-tau181/t-tau ratio (t = 3.09, p = 0.003) and lower Aβ1-42(t=-2.48, p=0.015). Conclusions: In this sample of former NFL players, AA race was associated with worse executive function, greater structural brain alterations, and lower Aβ1-42concentrations and higherp-tau181/t-tau ratio levels. These findings coincide with the extant literature on the differential race effects on neurobehavioral and neurologic outcomes in the general population. AA make up a large proportion of the football population, particularly at the professional level, and studies examining neurologic outcomes in this population should account for race.","2019","2020-05-20 00:16:04","2020-05-20 00:16:04","","P690-P691","","7","15","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jalz.2019.06.2678; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2003374875","conference abstract; human; human experiment; football; Caucasian; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; controlled study; major clinical study; body mass; velocity; visual memory; white matter; mood; African American; endogenous compound; education; quantitative analysis; gray matter; chronic traumatic encephalopathy; tau protein; right hippocampus; Alzheimer disease; sample size; linear regression analysis; imaging software; amyloid beta protein[1-42]; cerebrospinal fluid; executive function; immunoassay; lumbar puncture; principal component analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Players were classified into six groups according to their age: G1 (≤22.5 years), G2 (22.6-25.1 years), G3 (25.2-27.5 years), G4 (27.6-30.1 years), G5 (30.2-33.1 years) and G6 (≥33.2 years). Coefficients of variation (CVs) were calculated individually for each player and performance variable: total distance, low- intensity, medium-intensity, high-intensity running (HIR), sprinting, number of HIR, number of sprints, average speed and maximal speed. The main finding of this study was that players under 25.2 years (G1 and G2) showed lower CVs for high-intensity activities (HIR and sprinting) in comparison with players over 33.1 years (G6). These findings provide useful information for soccer coaches, who could put extra attention on physical performance of the oldest players when they have to play an entire match, because their performance is more variable and uncertain in comparison with the youngest.","2019","2020-05-20 00:16:05","2020-05-20 00:16:05","","1-9","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15438627.2019.1680985; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629645611","human; article; football; soccer player; season; physical performance; running; velocity; attention; cell cycle G1 phase","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the majority of research to date has focussed on responses to endurance exercise, with little understanding of the potential impact of contact-based sports on gastrointestinal damage. The high intensity nature of rugby, combined with trauma from collisions, suggests that this may cause considerable increases in gastrointestinal damage and permeability. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a standardised rugby training session on plasma concentrations of iFABP as a marker of gastrointestinal damage. Nineteen male academy level rugby players ((mean ± SD) age 20 ± 2 years, weight; 100.1 ± 13.9 kg) completed a standardised rugby training session at the beginning of the pre-season period. Participants arrived after an overnight fast after abstaining from spicy food, alcohol, caffeine and exercise in the previous 24-hours. All participants were declared fit to play and reported no gastrointestinal illness or disturbances. A venous blood sample and gastrointestinal symptoms were collected immediately before and after the exercise test. The exercise session was based on a four-person rugbybased situational practice, with an emphasis on evasion skills, collision and within-contact exertion (contact-based conditioning). Each group of participants rotated through four different roles; one attacking, one defending, and two as supporting defenders. Each block was approximately 8 minutes in duration and was repeated 3 times for a total of 24 minutes. Plasma concentrations of iFABP increased significantly from 2024 ± 913 before the training session to 3624 ± 1790 μg/ml after the training session (p = 0.003). However, there were minimal gastrointestinal symptoms reported before or after exercise. In conclusion, a standardised rugby training session as part of pre-season training significantly increased plasma concentrations of iFABP, which is indicative of gastrointestinal damage. Further research is required to establish whether this damage is sufficient to increase gastrointestinal permeability as this may have consequences for bacterial translocation, inflammation and nutrient absorption during recovery.","2019","2020-05-20 00:16:07","2020-05-20 00:16:07","","11-12","","","29","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1123/ijsnem.2019-0057; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628159942","adult; conference abstract; human; male; rugby; case report; clinical article; season; young adult; exercise test; human tissue; skill; human cell; venous blood; protein blood level; endogenous compound; alcohol; plasma; bacterial translocation; caffeine; fatty acid binding protein 2; gastrointestinal disease; gastrointestinal symptom; inflammation; nutrient; stomach injury","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Initial differences between the maturity groups were found in anthropometrical (weight and height) and physical performance variables (One Repetition Maximum (RM), Peak Power output (PP), 30-m sprint and T-test). The strength-training programme was beneficial for the three maturity groups (p< 0.05) with general greater improvements for the Pre- and Mid-PHV groups, with large effects in RM, PP and T-test, than for the Post-PHV group (moderate effects). The strength-training programme proposed in the present study seems to be positive for the strength-related development in young soccer players especially for Pre- and Mid-PHV players. The differences in the training adaptations for players with different maturity status suggest the individualization of the training stimulus for the correct long-term development of the players.","2019","2020-05-20 00:16:09","2020-05-20 00:16:09","","","","7","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0219355; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002381201","human; male; article; soccer player; exercise intensity; controlled study; physical performance; training; adolescent; body weight; child; school child; body height; maturation; strength; adaptation; maturity; stimulus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Carbohydrates (CHO) are the main fuel for intense training sessions and matches. Previous studies have shown a reduction of fatigue alongside a retention of cognitive performance in football players ingesting CHO during trials conducted in laboratory settings. However, little work has examined female players or whether taking CHO during matches can have similar effects in an applied setting. The current study aimed to determine if a 12%CHO beverage taken before and at half time in a football match could aid retention of cognitive function and reduce fatigue, in female football players. 6 Spanish players played 2 football matches on separate days. The players ingested 250 ml during the warm-up and 250 ml at halftime of either a non-caloric placebo beverage (PLA) or a 12% maltodextrin beverage (CHO). Both beverages were matched for taste, odor and color. Gastric distress and gut fullness (GD, GF), session rate of perceived exertion (S-RPE;), fatigue () and mood (MS) were recorded before the match, during half-time, and at the end of the match. Urine color (UC) and body mass were assessed before the warm up and at the end of the match. Ball possession (BP) and sprints were recorded during matches. Players completed the Stroop Color cognitive function test and a mental concentration test at the end of the match. All data were analyzed by Wilcoxon signed-rank test. S-RPE was higher in CHO than in PLA at half-time (p = 0.03) and at the end of the match (p = 0.03). Fatigue increased between the half-time and the end of the match when players took PLA (p = 0.04). Mass loss over the match was significantly higher in CHO trial (p = 0.04). No differences were found for GD, GF, MS, BP, S, or cognitive function and mental concentration. In conclusion, taking 250 ml of a 12% CHO beverage during warm up and at half-time of football matches with similar game analysis aspects did not impact upon gastrointestinal symptoms, cognitive function, or mental concentration in professional female soccer players, which could be related with the different S-RPE of each match that cannot be controlled during an ecological valid setting.","2019","2020-05-20 00:16:10","2020-05-20 00:16:10","","2","","","29","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1123/ijsnem.2019-0057; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628159694","adult; conference abstract; female; football player; human; soccer player; controlled study; body weight; warm up; fatigue; mood; carbohydrate intake; drug therapy; cognitive function test; beverage; placebo; Wilcoxon signed ranks test; gastrointestinal symptom; gastrointestinal tract; maltodextrin; mental concentration; odor; urine color","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, there are few reports on the prevalence and persistence of LVH in elite athletes following retirement. Methods: Former professional football players (n = 1172) were sampled for demographics, blood pressure, anthropometry, and 2D echocardiogram. Left ventricle mass was indexed to body surface area to obtain left ventricle mass index (LVMI). Subjects were stratified by age and playing position group. Statistical analysis included ANOVA, T-test, and Chi-square where appropriate. Results: The population prevalence of LVH was 12.3%. Age and position group contrasts are reported in Table 1. There was a significant effect of playing position (p = 0.0388) but not age (p = 0.0846) on LVH prevalence (Table 1). Blood pressure was higher in subjects with severe LVH versus normal LVMI (p = 0.0059), and subjects with hypertension (HTN) tended to have a higher prevalence of LVH (p = 0.0753). Detraining time had no effect on the prevalence (p = 0.1443) or type (p = 0.2152) of LVH. Conclusion: Despite considerable time detrained, LVH appears to persist in some former players and is likely the result of various factors including body size, HTN, and age. Position-specific training may also play a role in the development, type, and persistence of LVH. Further research is warranted to understand the clinical consequences of this factor on potential cardiovascular risk later in life.

Cold water immersion can help for more efficient recovery in athletes. This study was conducted to investigate the effect of cold water immersion applied after exercise on cardiac troponin T and myoglobin levels. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The experimental group comprised of a total of 23 male football players, of which 12 comprised the study group (age 22.4±3.16 years, height 176.9±6.08 cm, BMI 22.61±1.27 kg/m2) and 11 comprised the control group (age 21.3±2.21 years, height 175.8±5.52 cm, BMI 21.24±3.15 kg/m2).The athletes provided blood samples before exercise (BE) for troponin T (cTnT) and myoglobin (Mb) measurement. Consequently, muscle damage exercise protocol consisting of depth jump, and immediately after this, cold-water immersion at 15°C was applied to experimental group for 10 minutes. The athletes provided blood samples after 2 (2h) and 24 (24h) hours from cold water immersion. Athletes in the control group underwent the same measurements except application of cold-water immersion. RESULTS: While there was a significant difference (p<0.05) between the experimental and the control groups regarding troponin values, no significant difference was found for the myoglobin values (p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, cTnT level, which is regarded as one of the most specific markers of cardiac injury, was found to be lower in the athletes who underwent cold water immersion. These results indicate that the recovery time may be shorter in athletes undergoing cold-water immersion.","2019","2020-05-20 00:16:13","2020-05-20 00:16:13","","22-28","","1","40","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628432911","adult; football player; human; human experiment; male; article; exercise; exercise intensity; controlled study; body mass; young adult; blood sampling; body weight; normal human; body height; protein blood level; body composition; descriptive research; heart injury; myoglobin; protein analysis; troponin T; water immersion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

K.","The Effect of Concussive Injury on Individual Game Performance in Professional Collision-Sport Athletes","Journal of sport rehabilitation","","1543-3072","10.1123/jsr.2018-0168","","Clinical Scenario: Collision sports are often at higher risk of concussion due to the physical nature and style of play. Typically, initial clinical recovery occurs within 7 to 10 days; however, even this time frame may result in significant time lost from play. Little has been done in previous research to analyze how individual game performance may be affected upon return to play postconcussion. Focused Clinical Question: Upon return-to-play clearance, how does sport-related concussion affect game performance of professional athletes in collision sports? Summary of Key Findings: All 3 studies included found no significant change in individual performance of professional collision-sport athletes upon returning to play from concussive injury. One of the studies indicated that there was no difference in performance for NFL athletes who did not miss a single game (returned within 7 d) and those who missed at least 1 game. One study indicated that although there was no change in performance of NFL players upon returning to play from sustained concussion, there was a decline in performance in the 2 weeks before the diagnosed injury and appearing on the injury report. The final study indicated that there was no difference in performance or style of play of NHL athletes who missed time due to concussive injury when compared with athletes who missed games for a noninjury factor. Clinical Bottom Line: There was no change in performance upon return from concussive injury suggesting that players appear to be acutely recovered from the respective concussion before returning to play. This suggests that current policies and management properly evaluate and treat concussed athletes of these professional sports. Strength of Recommendation: Grade C evidence exists that there is no change in individual game performance in professional collision-sport athletes before and after suffering a concussion.","2019","2020-05-20 00:16:15","2020-05-20 00:16:15","","769-773","","7","28","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1123/jsr.2018-0168; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629225690","human; football; sport injury; brain concussion; return to sport; athlete; hockey; athletic performance; complication","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recovery is required to maximize training and competition performance; fatigue should be minimized by recovering as fast as possible. This study aimed to assess effects of contrast water therapy on blood lactate concentration after high-intensity interval training (HiiT) in elite futsal players. Methods. A total of 30 male futsal athletes volunteered to be subjects in this study. The test session consisted of repeated sprints at the distance of 25 m (3 series of two 1-min repetitions at 90% of maximum heart rate). After HiiT, the participants were randomized into 2 groups; 15 received contrast water therapy (CWT), and 15 were given slow jogging recovery (SJR). The recovery for the CWT group consisted of periodic immersions in cold water (18°C) for 1 min and then in hot water (37°C) for 2 min, with accumulating 15 min in the water. The recovery for the SJR group included 8 min of slow jogging (6.8 km · h−1) around a field. Results. After 30-min recovery, lactate concentration was significantly greater (p = 0.001) in the SJR group (7.67 mmol/l) than in the CWT group (6.82 mmol/l) and remained significantly different 60 min after recovery (p = 0.0001; 6.80 mmol/l and 5.01 mmol/l, respectively). Conclusions. We demonstrated that CWT after HiiT had an effect on the recovery of elite futsal players by decreasing the lactate concentration and rapid recovery of heart rate.","2019","2020-05-20 00:16:19","2020-05-20 00:16:19","","12-19","","3","27","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.5114/pq.2019.86463; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2003284957","adult; human; male; article; heart rate; oxygen consumption; controlled study; jogging; warm up; high intensity interval training; normal human; anthropometry; lactic acid; lactate blood level; pretest posttest design; therapy effect; ball sports athlete; water immersion; cold; contrast water therapy; hot water","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2019-Lower and between-limb asymmetrical eccentric hamstring isokinetic strength may be associated with hamstring injuries, which mainly affect the biceps femoris. The 45° hip extension exercise (HEE) strengthens the hamstrings in the lengthened position where the biceps femoris experiences greatest loading during high-speed running. However, the effect of an HEE program on eccentric hamstring isokinetic strength has not been investigated or compared with the Nordic Hamstring Exercise (NHE) program. Twenty-four male, varsity, Gaelic footballers (22.4 ± 2.7 years; 182.1 ± 6.0 cm; 84.4 ± 7.9 kg) were randomly allocated to an HEE or NHE 4-week program. Isokinetic (60°·s) eccentric peak torque, functional hamstring-to-quadriceps ratio, and between-limb eccentric strength (absolute and percentage) asymmetries were recorded before and after intervention. Muscle soreness scores were reported after exercise using a visual analogue scale. A mixed between-within analysis of variance investigated group (HEE vs. NHE) by time (pre vs. post) interaction effects, and any main effects. An independent-samples t-test compared muscle soreness scores between the NHE and HEE groups. No interaction or group main effects were found. Main effects for time were observed on dominant and nondominant limbs for eccentric peak torque (p < 0.001, η = 0.21, p = 0.01, η = 0.51, respectively) and functional hamstring quadriceps ratio (p = 0.03, η = 0.59, p < 0.0001, η = 0.26, respectively). There were no main effects for time between-limb eccentric peak torque or percentage asymmetries (p = 0.41, η = 0.03, p = 0.20, η = 0.07, respectively), or differences in muscle soreness scores (p > 0.05). A 4-week HEE program increases eccentric hamstring isokinetic strength similar to a NHE program, which may be useful as part of a hamstring injury prevention program.","2019","2020-05-20 00:16:28","2020-05-20 00:16:28","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1519/JSC.0000000000003220; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628965794","adult; football player; human; male; article; hip; exercise; controlled study; analysis of variance; running; velocity; randomized controlled trial; accident prevention; visual analog scale; biceps femoris muscle; torque; quadriceps femoris muscle","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: 33 Tunisian highly trained soccer players [19 men (age: 17 ± 0.3 years, BMI: 21.9 ± 1.4 kg m− 2) and 14 women (age: 17 ± 0.2 years, BMI: 21.3 ± 3.5 kg m− 2)] took part in two experimental sessions with or without listening to music during warming-up. High-tempo music (> 130–140 bpm) was chosen. The players then performed a repeated-sprint test (six 40-m sprints with 180° direction change interspersed with a 20-s passive recovery period). Best and mean sprint times, performance decrement, as well as affective load scores were measured. Results: The analysis of variance for repeated measures revealed a significant improvement in best and mean time only in females (P < 0.05). Moreover, no significant effect of music was observed on performance decrement and affective load in both males and females (all P > 0.05). Conclusions: Female academy soccer players seemed to derive the greatest benefit from motivational music during repeated-sprint exercise compared to their male counterparts.

Effect of match play on shoulder strength in amateur rugby union players. J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2019-The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of match play on shoulder internal rotation (IR) and external rotation (ER) strength in amateur Australian rugby union players. Maximal isometric shoulder IR and ER strength was measured in 18 male players using hand-held dynamometry before match, at half-time, after match, and 1, 3, and 7 days after match. Match stress was measured intrinsically (rating of perceived exertion) and extrinsically (number of shoulder events). Linear mixed regression modeling determined differences in strength measures while exploring possible confounders, including history of pain, pain on testing, player position, exposure, height, body mass, and body mass index. From the models, IR strength decreased from before match to after match (adjusted mean difference 1.96 kg; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.63-3.29, p = 0.004), 1 day after match (2.47; 1.14-3.80, p < 0.001), and 3 days after match (1.75; 0.42-3.09, p = 0.010). External rotation strength decreased from before match to half-time (adjusted mean difference 1.54 kg, 95% CI: 0.65-2.42, p = 0.001), but no other time points demonstrated significant changes in ER strength compared with before match. None of the possible confounding variables significantly affected strength changes over time. Rugby union match play is associated with reduced shoulder strength, particularly IR. Future research is required to establish whether strength changes are associated with shoulder pain and injury.","2019","2020-05-20 00:16:34","2020-05-20 00:16:34","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1519/JSC.0000000000003208; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L630136732","adult; human; male; article; rugby; injury; exercise; controlled study; body mass; rotation; dynamometry; stress; confounding variable; disease simulation; shoulder pain","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

J Strength Cond Res 33(5): 1222-1231,2019—This study evaluates the weekly natural log of the root-mean-square difference of successive R-R intervals (lnRMSSDmean), its coefficient of variation (lnRMSSDcv), training load (TL), stress tolerance (ST), and changes in intermittent running performance in response to a 2-week overload (OL) followed by a 1 -week taper (TP) during a preseason. Additionally, we determined the relationships between these variables. Ultra-short InRMSSD, psychometric responses, and ratings of perceived exertion were evaluated daily among 16 under-19 soccer players. At the end of each training phase, the athletes performed the Yo- Yo Intermittent Recovery test level 1 (Yo-Yo). Group analysis showed a decrease in lnRMSSDmean and ST, increases in lnRMSSDcv, and decreases in the Yo-Yo during OL, with a return to baseline levels and a trivial increase in the Yo-Yo during TP. Small to very large correlations were found between lnRMSSDmean and lnRMSSDcv values, with changes in Yo-Yo, TL, monotony, and strain during the preseason (rvalues ranging from -0 .2 7 to 0.82). No correlation was found between InRMSSD responses and ST. During OL, athletes with decreases in lnRMSSDmean and increases in lnRMSSDcv accumulated higher perceived TL, with higher monotony and overall stress, and presented a decrease in ST and intermittent running performance, interpreted as a negative adaptation in response to the maintenance of higher TL. During TP, these responses were reversed, leading to an increase in intermittent running performance. In addition, subjective measures of ST may be used to provide early indicators of training adaptation in soccer players.

The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of donning lower-body garments fitted with cooled phase change material (PCM) on recovery of neuromuscular function following competitive soccer match-play. Methods: Using a randomized, crossover design, 11 male semi-professional soccer players wore PCM cooled to 15°C (PCMcold) or left at ambient temperature (PCMamb; sham control) for 3 h following soccer match-play. Pre-, and 24, 48, and 72 h post-match, participants completed a battery of neuromuscular, physical, and perceptual tests. Maximal voluntary contraction force (MVC) and twitch responses to electrical (femoral nerve) and magnetic (motor cortex) stimulation (TMS) during isometric knee-extension and at rest were measured to assess central nervous system (CNS) (voluntary activation, VA) and muscle contractile (quadriceps potentiated twitch force, Qtw,pot) function. Fatigue and perceptions of muscle soreness were assessed via visual analog scales, and physical function was assessed through measures of jump [countermovement jump (CMJ) height and reactive strength index (RSI)] performance. A belief questionnaire was completed pre- and post-intervention to determine the perceived effectiveness of each garment. Results: Competitive soccer match-play elicited persistent decrements in MVC, VA measured with femoral nerve stimulation, Qtw,pot, as well as reactive strength, fatigue and muscle soreness (P < 0.05). Both MVC and VA were higher at 48 h post-match after wearing PCMcold compared with PCMamb (P < 0.05). However, there was no effect of PCM on the magnitude or time-course of recovery for any other neuromuscular, physical function, or perceptual indices studied (P > 0.05). The belief questionnaire revealed that players perceived that both PCMcold and PCMamb were moderately effective in improving recovery, with no difference between the two interventions (P = 0.56). Conclusion: Although wearing cooled PCM garments improved MVC and VA 48 h following match-play, the lack of effect on measures of physical function or perceptual responses to match-play suggest that PCM offers a limited benefit to the recovery process. The lack of effect could have been due to the relatively small magnitude of change in most of the outcome measures studied.","2019","2020-05-20 00:16:39","2020-05-20 00:16:39","","","","JUN","10","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2019.00647; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628533047","human; male; article; soccer; soccer player; controlled study; randomized controlled trial; muscle contraction; fatigue; muscle disease; physical examination; rest; visual analog scale; clinical effectiveness; crossover procedure; neuromuscular function; central nervous system; central nervous system function; cryotherapy device; environmental temperature; femoral nerve; maximal voluntary contraction; motor cortex; musculoskeletal system parameters; nerve stimulation; perception test; phase change material; transcranial magnetic stimulation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Twenty-one male university football players were randomly assigned into the FIFA 11+ (N.=10) or control group (conventional dynamic WU exercise, N.=11). The participants performed static, drop jump, and maximal voluntary muscle contraction (MVC) tests before and after the WU protocol in four different occasions with 0, 10, 20 or 30 min resting interval. Static balance with 4 sensory conditions (stable surface with eyes open, stable surface with eyes closed, unstable surface with eyes open, and unstable surface with eyes closed), drop jump (30 and 50 cm heights), and MVC of knee extension and flexion were examined. The electromyography (EMG) of rectus femoris, vastus medialis, biceps femoris were recorded during the drop jump and MVC measurements.

C.; Tamulevicius, N.","The effect of sleep on explosive strength gains in female collegiate soccer players during off-season training: a pilot study","International Journal of Sports Physical Therapy","","21592896","","","Objective: In athletes, sleep quantity and quality are imperative to effective physiological and cognitive functioning. In addition, sleep quantity and quality may affect the outcome of an offseason resistance training program. This study aimed to investigate the effect of sleep quantity and quality on explosive strength in NCAA D1 female collegiate soccer players during an off-season training program. Methods: Eleven female collegiate soccer players (19.8±0.8 years) participated in an off-season resistance training program three days per week for five weeks. A jump mat and associated software was used to measure explosive strength (ES), defined as the maximum vertical jump height inches (in) in over three trials, prior to the start of the training program and at the end of a 5-week training program. Sleep quantity, in hours (h), was reported by each athlete at the initiation of the study and before the start of each resistance training session. Each athlete also reported sleep quality on a 5-point scale (1 = poor quality and 5 = great quality) at the same times as sleep quantity. Results: No difference in ES was observed as a result of the 5-week resistance training program (initial = 17.8±2.3 vs final = 18.3±2.4). Initial average sleep quantity was 6.7±0.6 while at study conclusion was 6.8±0.9. The median sleep quality at the start of the program was 3.2±0.5, and 3.8±0.4 at study conclusion. A weak correlation between sleep quantity and ES (r = 0.11) was observed, while a moderate correlation between sleep quality and ES was noted (r = -0.37). Conclusion: A weak correlation between sleep quantity and ES was observed, yet sleep quantity reported is more than one hour less than that recommended for college athletes. The moderate correlation between sleep quality and ES suggests improved sleep quality may benefit ES development. Clinical implications: Practitioners should consider that sleep quality may mediate the development of ES during off-season resistance training.

Methods: Fourteen male rugby players (age = 25.9 [2.5] y, height = 186.1 [6.7] cm, and body mass = 104.1 [12.7] kg) participated in this study. Testing occurred across 2 d on 2 separate occasions (week 1 and week 2). On day 1 of both weeks, participants completed an SPS training session. On day 2 of both weeks, participants undertook a field-based rugby training session. In week 2, participants underwent an additional treatment in the form of a motivational presentation given by a respected former player before the rugby session. Saliva was collected before and after SPS training and before and after the rugby session and was assayed for testosterone and cortisol. Results: No differences were found between weeks for sal-T at any time point, but sal-C was higher in week 2 before and after SPS and before rugby on day 2 (P <.05). In both weeks, T:C increased following SPS (P <.02, ES > 0.91 [0.13, 1.69]). T:C increased when the motivational presentation accompanied rugby training (P =.07, ES = 1.06 [0.27, 1.85]). Sal-C, not sal-T, drove changes in T:C (P <.001). Conclusions: Physical or psychosocial treatments may affect sal-T, sal-C, and T:C, and individual variation in responses to treatments may exist.

A major argument to convince coaches to use this exercise-based injury prevention programme, is a potential performance enhancement of the players. Therefore, this study investigated the effects of the ""11+ Kids"" programme on isokinetic strength. METHODS: Two teams were randomly assigned to the intervention and control group. The intervention group replaced their warm-up by the ""11+ Kids"" and the control group warmed-up as usual. Two days before and after the 10-week intervention, isokinetic strength of the hip adductors and abductors, knee flexors and extensors, and ankle invertors and evertors was tested. RESULTS: Thirty-one players (mean age 11.5 ± 0.8 years) completed the study. The intervention group showed large improvements in all isokinetic strength measures (p < 0.001 for all measures, Cohen's d 0.8 to 1.4), whereas the control group only showed negligible to medium positive effects (p-values from 0.006 to 0.718, Cohen's d -0.1 to 0.7). The intervention was beneficial compared to the control group regarding isokinetic strength of the hip adductors (p < 0.001), knee flexors (p = 0.002), as well as ankle evertors (p < 0.001) and invertors (p = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Given the relatively short intervention period of 10 weeks, the observed improvements relate to a practically meaningful effect of the intervention. The gain in strength may improve players' performance and may contribute to a reduction of injury risk in the long-term application.","2019","2020-05-20 00:16:59","2020-05-20 00:16:59","","1-19","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1123/ijspp.2018-0827; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L627286285","football player; human; article; soccer; hip; knee; controlled study; juvenile; randomized controlled trial; warm up; child; school child; ankle; accident prevention; statistical significance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of the FIFA 11+ program on landing patterns in soccer players classified as at low or high risk for noncontact anterior cruciate ligament injuries. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Field-based functional movement screening performed at the soccer field. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 24 elite male youth soccer players participated in this study. INTERVENTION: The intervention group performed the FIFA 11+ program 3 times per week for 8 weeks, whereas the control group performed their regular warm-up program. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Before and after the intervention, all participants were assessed for landing mechanics using the Landing Error Scoring System. Pretraining Landing Error Scoring System scores were used to determine risk groups. RESULTS: The FIFA 11+ group had greater improvement than the control group in terms of improving the landing pattern; there was a significant intergroup difference (F1,20 = 28.86, P < .001, ηp2=.591). Soccer players categorized as being at high risk displayed greater improvement from the FIFA 11+ program than those at low risk (P = .03). However, there was no significant difference in the proportion of risk category following the routine warm-up program (P = 1.000). CONCLUSIONS: The present study provides evidence of the usefulness of the FIFA 11+ program for reducing risk factors associated with noncontact anterior cruciate ligament injuries. The authors' results also suggest that soccer players with the higher risk profile would benefit more than those with lower risk profiles and that targeting them may improve the efficacy of the FIFA 11+ program.","2019","2020-05-20 00:17:01","2020-05-20 00:17:01","","1-8","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1123/jsr.2018-0374; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629636872","human; male; article; soccer player; biomechanics; controlled study; scoring system; adolescent; juvenile; warm up; anterior cruciate ligament injury; risk factor; high risk population; drug efficacy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The study was conducted at the training facility of a community soccer association in the Ottawa area. Participants: A convenience sample of 83 soccer players between the ages of 10 to 14 was recruited over 4 consecutive weeks of summer soccer camp. Main outcome measures: Concussion knowledge and attitudes were measured using the Concussion Knowledge and Attitude Questionnaire (CKAT) before, after and at one-month post education. Objectif : Un essai contrôlé randomisé par groupe a servi à comparer l'efficacité de la présentation par diapositives du cours de ParachuteMC intitulé «Sensibilisation aux commotions cérébrales pour les sportifs» (SCCS) (groupe d'intervention), comparativement au fait de fournir uniquement les informations écrites de ParachuteMC sur les commotions cérébrales (groupe témoin). Cette étude a été menée au centre d'entraînement d'une association communautaire de soccer de la région d'Ottawa. Participants : Un échantillon de commodité de 83 joueurs de soccer âgés de 10 à 14 ans a été recruté au cours des 4 semaines consécutives d'un camp d'été de soccer. Mesures principales des résultats : Les connaissances et les attitudes vis-à-vis des commotions cérébrales ont été mesurées à l'aide du Concussion Knowledge and Attitude Questionnaire (CKAT) avant et après la formation, ainsi qu'un mois suivant cette dernière. Results: The provision of the standardized PCAP concussion education program resulted in a statistically significant increase in mean knowledge scores (p=0.004) compared to the provision of standardized written material. A significant effect of time (p<0.001) was noted in both the intervention and control groups demonstrating a higher attitude score after the education. Conclusions: The provision of standardized core curriculum to children improved their ability to appropriately identify concussion symptoms. Regardless of how standardized education was provided, improvement in concussion attitude scores was noted. Increasing children's general attitude toward concussion may empower them to report their symptoms to a parent or coach. Résultats : La mise en œuvre du programme éducatif normalisé sur les commotions cérébrales SCCS de ParachuteMC a entraîné une augmentation statistique considérable des scores de connaissances moyens (p=0,004) par rapport à la présentation de matériel écrit normalisé.

Conclusions : La mise en œuvre d'un programme éducatif de base normalisé chez les enfants a amélioré leurs capacités à reconnaître les symptômes d'une commotion cérébrale. La formation, peu importe la méthode utilisée, a permis d'augmenter les scores d'attitude vis-à-vis des commotions cérébrales.

Current evidence suggests that band flossing results in performance improvements and may also be an effective method in injury prevention. Objective: Previous research has shown that tissue flossing may result in increased ankle range of motion, jump, and sprinting performance in recreational athletes. The present study aims to extend on this research, within an elite athlete sample. Design: Counterbalanced, cross-over design with experimental and control trials, separated by 1 week. Setting: University laboratory. Participants: Fourteen professional male rugby union athletes (mean [SD]: age 23.9 [2.7] y). Intervention: Application of a floss band to both ankles (FLOSS) for 2 minutes or without flossing of the ankle joints (CON) on 2 separate occasions. Main Outcome Measures: A weight-bearing lunge test, a countermovement jump test, and a 20-m sprint test at pre and at 5 and 30 minutes post application of the floss band or control. Results: There were no statistically significant interactions between treatment (FLOSS/CON) and time for any of the measured variables (P > .05). Effect size analysis revealed small benefits for FLOSS in comparison with CON for countermovement performance 5 minutes post (d = 0.28) and for 10-m (d = -0.45) and 15-m (d = -0.24) sprint time 30 minutes post. Conclusion: Findings from the current study suggest minimal benefits of tissue flossing when applied to the ankle joint in elite athletes for up to 30 minutes following their application.","2019","2020-05-20 00:17:06","2020-05-20 00:17:06","","1-5","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1123/jsr.2018-0302; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628268348","adult; human; male; article; rugby; clinical article; controlled study; athlete; outcome assessment; ischemic preconditioning; effect size; ankle; range of motion; weight bearing; blood vessel occlusion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between TL measurements during a small-sided soccer game and the subsequent increase in cTn in young players. Twenty male soccer players (age 11.9 ± 2 years, height 151 ± 13 cm, weight 43 ± 13 kg) were monitored during a 5 × 5 small-sided game and had blood samples drawn before, immediately after, and 3 h after exercise for a posterior analysis of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT). Internal, external, and mixed metrics of TL were obtained from the rating of perceived exertion (RPE), heart rate (HR), and GPS player tracking. The results show that the concentration of hs-cTnT peaked at 3 h post-exercise in all participants. The magnitude of hs-cTnT elevation was mainly explained by the exercise duration in the maximal heart rate zone (Maximum Probability of Effect (MPE) = 92.5%), time in the high-speed zone (MPE = 90.4 %), and distance in the high-speed zone (MPE = 90.45%). Our results support the idea that common metrics of TL in soccer, easily obtained using player tracking systems, are strongly associated with the release of hs-cTnT in children and adolescents.","2019","2020-05-20 00:17:07","2020-05-20 00:17:07","","","","23","16","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph16234853; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2003265136","human; human experiment; male; article; soccer; soccer player; exercise; heart rate; physical performance; velocity; child; normal human; global positioning system; protein blood level; physical parameters; troponin T; high sensitivity cardiac troponin T; rating of perceived exertion; training load; unclassified drug","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

High levels of HRV are associated with improved stress management and sport performance. This study examined the effectiveness of athletes' (N = 20 collegiate male soccer players) existing mental strategies in maintaining high HRV following three separate stressors. A brief (12-minute) athlete-specific adaptation of a physiological assessment protocol was administered to all athletes. Findings suggest that athletes significantly improved HRV following a cognitive and sport-specific stressor (p <.05); however, athletes were unable to increase HRV following a physical stressor (p >.05). Results suggest athletes were less equipped to cope with physical pain. The process of providing assessment feedback to coaches and athletes is discussed. Finally, clinical and research applications for this brief assessment are introduced and explored.

Players with dysfunctional movement patterns, measured by the Functional Movement Screen (FMSTM), are more likely to suffer an injury compared than those who have higher scores on the FMSTM. The purpose of our study was to assess the effectiveness of 8-weeks of functional movement-based training on fundamental movement patterns. Two groups of Professional male soccer players (experimental, N=15, and control N=15), aged between 18 and 28, of an Italian second division team were compared using the pre-post FMSTM scores after intervention. RM-MANOVA 2 Groups (experimental and control) X 2 Test (pre and post) on the FMS scores revealed a significant a difference for the interaction between Groups and Tests (Wilk's lamba .712, F(3,26) = 3.50, p =.029 Eta2 = .288 Power .713). Following Univariate results on the three subscales of the FMSTM revealed significant interaction between group and test on advanced movement (F(1,28) = 5.19, p = .03, eta2 =.157, observed power .595) and mobility (F(1,28) = 3.89, p = .050, eta2 =.122, observed power .478) but not on stability (p = .305). The results of this study suggest that an 8- week intervention program was an effective way for improving FMSTM scores in a group of male professional soccer players, particularly for advanced movement and mobility subscales. From an applied point of view this findings provide more evidence on the efficacy of qualitative intervention on functional movement pattern improvement that is related to the injury prevention and suggest the importance of specific movement-based intervention with soccer players.

The objective was to assess the general and sport nutrition knowledge of adolescent soccer players before and after a nutrition education intervention. Nutrition knowledge of youthacademy soccer players (n=65) from four teams (U19, U17, U15, U14) was assessed using the validated General and Sport Nutrition Knowledge Questionnaire before and after the players participated in a 5-month nutrition education intervention of monthly nutrition education newsletters, electronic handouts and nutrition lesson/workshop for players and parents. The assessment consisted of 64 general and 34 sports nutrition questions; each had a single correct answer. Total correct score and subscores were calculated for macronutrient, micronutrient, general nutrition, and sport nutrition. The intervention was analyzed using a knowledge profile distinguishing <33rd percentile as low, 33rd-66th percentile as medium, and >66th as high. Total correct score for all participants before/after the intervention was 32%/37% (with increases in all subscores); for teams was U19 (39%/42%), U17 (28%/ 32%), U15 (3156/41%) and U14 (31%/36%). In looking at knowledge profiles, the total scores and scores for U15 and U14 teams moved from low knowledge profile to medium knowledge profile. The total score for all participants for micronutrient knowledge did not move out of low knowledge profile (25.06%/32.18%). The intervention was beneficial for select questions about salt, iron and sports nutrition knowledge but no other questions. The nutrition intervention was effective in increasing knowledge levels with a need to concentrate in areas of micronutrients.

Materials and Methods: Ten, moderately trained, females (Mean [SD]; age 22.6 [2.7] y; stature 165.3 [6.2] cm; body mass 61.5 [8.7] kg; (Formula presented.) 43.9 [8.6] mL⋅kg–1⋅min–1) participated. The HST (31.0°C; 50%RH) was 9 × 5 min (45-min) of intermittent exercise, based on exercise intensities of female soccer players, using a motorized treadmill and Wattbike. Participants completed HST1 vs. HST2 as a control (C) trial. Followed by 90 min, STHA (no fluid intake), for five consecutive days in 39.5°C; 60%RH, using controlled-hyperthermia (∼rectal temperature [Tre] 38.5°C). The HST3 occurred within 1 week after STHA. The HST2 vs HST3 trials were in the luteal phase, using self-reported menstrual questionnaire and plasma 17β-estradiol. Results: Pre (HST2) vs post (HST3) STHA there was a reduction at 45-min in Tre by 0.20°C (95%CI −0.30 to −0.10°C; d = 0.77); (Formula presented.)

The GPET instrument was used to analyse the decision-making and execution of 3442 actions measured during competitive matches (pass, dribbling and shooting). Both variables were analysed with regard to the three tactical principles of attack: keep the ball possession, progression towards the goal and shooting at goal with the lowest level of opposition. With respect to the pass, results showed significantly higher values in decision-making and execution in the first and second principles, but not in the third one. In the dribbling action, results showed significantly higher values in decision-making in the second and third principle, but not in the first one.

Better understanding this during popular sports activities such as football may influence exercise habits. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to examine the effects of playing one single versus three consecutive days of 60-min small-sided football matches on postprandial lipemia. Methods: Fifteen males performed either one (1FOOT; n = 7) or three 60-min football (3FOOT; n = 8) sessions across an 8-day trial period. On day 1, a blood sample was collected at fasted (0 min) and 0.75, 2, 4, 6 h after a high-fat meal. Participants were then randomly allocated to the 1FOOT (day 7) or 3FOOT (days 5, 6, 7) condition. On day 8, they repeated the high-fat meal and blood sampling for 6 h following the meal. Postprandial total and incremental area under the curve (AUC, iAUC, respectively) were calculated. Results: The postprandial triglyceride iAUC was 41% lower from pre- to post-measures for the 1FOOT (p < 0.05; ES = 1.02) and 15.7% lower for the 3FOOT (ns; ES = 0.41). Total triglyceride AUC was lower (26%) post-football matches in the 3FOOT group only (p < 0.01; ES = 1.23). In 3FOOT, insulin concentration was lower for post- compared to pre-measures at 0.75 and 2 h, respectively (p < 0.001). Conclusion: One single 60-min small-sided football match lowered postprandial TG incremental area under the curve while performing three consecutive days of football matches did not result in a greater attenuation.

In addition, we analyzed relationships between training load, hematological parameters and players’ physical fitness. Methods Eighteen elite players were evaluated before (T1) and after (T2) a six-week in-season period interspersed with 10 soccer matches. At T1 and T2, players performed the Yo-Yo intermittent recovery test level 1 (YYIR1), the repeated shuttle sprint ability test (RSSA), the countermovement jump test (CMJ), and the squat jump test (SJ). In addition, PV and hematological parameters (erythrocytes [M/mm3], hematocrit [%], hemoglobin [g/dl], mean corpuscular volume [fl], mean corpuscular hemoglobin content [pg], and mean hemoglobin concentration [%]) were assessed. Daily ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) were monitored in order to quantify the internal training load. Results From T1 to T2, significant performance declines were found for the YYIR1 (p<0.001, effect size [ES] = 0.5), RSSA (p<0.01, ES = 0.6) and SJ tests (p< 0.046, ES = 0.7). However, no significant changes were found for the CMJ (p = 0.86, ES = 0.1). Post-exercise, RSSA blood lactate (p<0.012, ES = 0.2) and PV (p<0.01, ES = 0.7) increased significantly from T1 to T2. A significant decrease was found from T1 to T2 for the erythrocyte value (p<0.002, ES = 0.5) and the hemoglobin concentration (p<0.018, ES = 0.8). The hematocrit percentage rate was also significantly lower (p<0.001, ES = 0.6) at T2. The mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin content and the mean hemoglobin content values were not statistically different from T1 to T2. No significant relationships were detected between training load parameters and percentage changes of hematological parameters. However, a significant relationship was observed between training load and changes in RSSA performance (r = -0.60; p<0.003). Conclusions An intensive period of “congested match play” over 6 weeks significantly compromised players’ physical fitness. These changes were not related to hematological parameters, even though significant alterations were detected for selected measures.","2019","2020-05-20 00:17:37","2020-05-20 00:17:37","","","","7","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0219692; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002411700","adult; human; human experiment; male; article; soccer player; exercise intensity; training; body mass; blood sampling; hematocrit; hematological parameters; mean corpuscular volume; normal human; fitness; body height; lactate blood level; plasma volume; erythrocyte count; physical capacity; hemoglobin determination; mean corpuscular hemoglobin","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Effects of adding vertical or horizontal force-vector exercises to in-season general strength training on jumping and sprinting performance of youth football players. J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2019-Football is characterized by short-term high-intensity triaxial activities that require optimized neuromuscular capacity. Thus, training routines must consider the direction of force application, particularly when strength exercises are performed. This study aimed to explore the effects of adding vertical or horizontal force-vector exercises to a 20-week in-season general strength training program on jumping and sprinting performance of youth football players. Twenty-four well-trained male under-17 players participated in this study and were randomly assigned to a control, vertical, or horizontal training group. Control group performed a general strength training program (free weights, eccentric-overload, and body mass exercises) once a week during 20 weeks. Vertical and horizontal groups additionally performed back-half-squat or barbell hip-thrust, respectively. Vertical group improved vertical jump (VJ) (squat jump, likely 4.5; ±4.4% and countermovement jump, likely 4.9; ±4.1%), horizontal jump (HJ) (most likely 7.5; ±2.7%), and sprint (10 m, likely -1.6; ±2.0% and 20 m, very likely -3.3; ±1.6%). The horizontal group showed unclear results in VJ; however, large improvements were observed in HJ (most likely, 13.0; ±4.8%), 10 m and 20 m (very likely -3.0; ±1.8% and most likely -3.8; ±1.0%, respectively). Back-squat and hip-thrust showed an important transference effect to both jumping and sprinting performance. If considering the effects of back-squat on VJ, hip-thrust improved HJ and sprint to a greater extent. This study reinforces the importance of performing both vertical and horizontal force-vector exercises to enhance physical performance during football in-season, even when performed only once a week.","2019","2020-05-20 00:17:39","2020-05-20 00:17:39","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1519/JSC.0000000000003221; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628142485","adult; football player; human; male; article; hip; controlled study; season; physical performance; juvenile; randomized controlled trial; resistance training; jumping; transference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2019-This study aimed to evaluate the effects of age using a large-scale analysis of match physical performance in professional soccer players. A total of 10,739 individual match observations were undertaken on outfield players competing in the first and second divisions of the Spanish soccer professional leagues during the 2017-2018 season, using a computerized tracking system (TRACAB, Chyronhego, New York, USA). The players were classified into five positions and into 5 age groups (<20 years, 20-24.9 years, 25-29.9 years, 30-34.9 years, and ≥35 years). The results showed that (a) professional soccer players aged ≥30 years exhibit a significant decrease (p < 0.01) in the total distance covered, medium-speed running distance, high-speed running (HSR) distance, very HSR (VHSR) distance, sprint distance, and maximum running speed compared with younger players (<30 years); (b) professional soccer players aged ≥35 years exhibit a significant decrease (p < 0.01) in the number of HSR, number of VHSR, and number of sprints compared with younger players (<35 years); and (c) all playing positions reduced their physical performance; however, external midfielders were less affected by age effects. In conclusion, this study demonstrates players' physical match performance reduces with increasing age. Such findings may help coaches and managers to better understand the effects of age on match-related physical performance and may have the potential to assist in decisions regarding recruitment and player list management within professional soccer clubs.","2019","2020-05-20 00:17:41","2020-05-20 00:17:41","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1519/JSC.0000000000003244; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628625081","human; article; soccer player; season; physical performance; running; velocity; groups by age; manager; New York","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2019-Pre-season in soccer training develops the physical requisites for competition and usually consists of a high volume of aerobic and anaerobic conditioning training including friendly games. The purpose of the study was to determine the effects of pre-season training on the aerobic fitness of professional soccer players. Nineteen professional male soccer players (age = 27.37 ± 3.67 years, height = 179.61 ± 5.17 cm, and body fat percentage = 11.3 ± 3.19%) participated in this study performed an incremental cardiopulmonary exercise testing on a treadmill before and after the 8 weeks of pre-season preparation. The results were analyzed using paired t tests, revealing significant differences on several indices. The subjects improved significantly on maximal aerobic capacity (V[Combining Dot Above]O2max) and lasted significantly longer on the treadmill (p < 0.05). The V[Combining Dot Above]O2 at ventilatory threshold (VT) and respiratory compensation point (RCP) increased significantly (p < 0.05). The running velocity at ventilatory thresholds (vVT and vRCP) and at V[Combining Dot Above]O2 max (vVO2max) also increased significantly (p < 0.05). In conclusion, the results of this study, as expected, demonstrated that the proposed 8 weeks of pre-season training program was sufficient to cause significant improvements on the aerobic performance indices of professional soccer players. The study confirms the beneficial changes in the process of adaptations that occur with this type of training and can assist coaches and trainers in planning a successful pre-season training program.","2019","2020-05-20 00:17:42","2020-05-20 00:17:42","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1519/JSC.0000000000003209; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628901207","adult; human; male; article; soccer player; aerobic capacity; controlled study; season; training; height; exercise test; body fat; treadmill; oxygen; respiratory system; compensation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this study was to determine whether supplementation with cholecalciferol would reduce inflammation and muscle damage in soccer players after a simulated soccer match. Methods: Twenty-two soccer players (median age 27 y, interquartile range 5 y) were divided randomly into two groups, as follows: a cholecalciferol group (n = 11) and a placebo group (n = 11). Cholecalciferol supplements (50 000 IU/wk) or placebos were administered to the groups by an independent co-worker. After 8 wk, the athletes participated in a simulated soccer match, and perceived exertion and heart rates were measured during the trial. Blood samples were obtained presupplementation, postsupplementation, immediately after, and 2- and 24-h postexercise for measurement of lactate dehydrogenase, creatine phosphokinase, C-reactive protein (CRP), and interleukin (IL)-6. Results: The intervention group demonstrated a significant increase in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels (53.93, 10.68 ng/mL, P < 0.0001), which is the best indicator of vitamin D levels in the body, with no change in the circulating markers of muscle damage and CRP (P 0.05) but showed increased IL-6 (P = 0.034). In addition, the ratings of perceived exertion and heart rates were not altered by vitamin D compared with placebo ingestion (P = 0.155 versus P = 0.261; P = 0.600 versus P = 0.983).

The present study used a controlled repeated-measures research design to investigate the changes in FFM and FM using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Whole body %FM increased (effect size (ES) = 0.87 ± 0.46) and FFM reduced after DTP (ES = -0.30 ± 0.19), returning to values comparable to the end of the previous season after RTP. At regional levels, arms, legs, and trunk %FM increased (ES = from 0.42 to 1.29) while trunk-FFM was reduced (ES=-0.40±0.26) after DTP, returning to the values observed at the end of the previous season after RTP. Legs-FFM did not change after DTP, with a substantial increase after RTP in comparison with pre-season values (ES = 0.34 ± 0.29 and 0.53 ± 0.36 for the right and left leg, respectively). Despite the small sample size of the present study, the findings indicate that elite soccer players can be allowed 2 weeks of rest during a five-week DTP, since the changes in %FM and FFM were relatively small, and FM and FFM returned to the optimal initial values for competition after the proposed RTP during the pre-season.","2019","2020-05-20 00:17:51","2020-05-20 00:17:51","","","","8","2019","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.7466; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629669372","adult; human; male; article; football; soccer player; controlled study; season; competition; resistance training; leg; effect size; trunk; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; fat free mass; sample size","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Effects of different training interventions on the recovery of physical and neuromuscular performance after a soccer match. J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2019-In competitive soccer, players are frequently required to play in periods with congested fixtures in which they have limited time to recover between matches (3-4 days). Thus, finding the most appropriate intervention strategy to limit players' neuromuscular (muscle function of lower limbs) and physical (running performance) impairments in this short period becomes crucial. The aim of the study was to examine how muscle function of knee extensors and flexors and sprint performance recovered +72 hours after match in relation to different field-based training sessions. Using a crossover design, 9 subelite players (age 17.6 ± 0.5 years, height 1.77 ± 0.02 m, body mass 66.4 ± 5.8 kg) underwent a soccer-specific training (SST) session or an active recovery regime (AR) on the second day after a match. Immediately after (0 hour) and +72 hours after match, 30-m sprint and repeated sprint ability (RSA) were assessed. Maximum isometric voluntary force (MVF) of knee extensors and flexors was determined at 120° and 90° (with 180° being full extension), respectively. SST and AR promoted similar effects on the recovery kinetics of sprint, RSA, and MVF of knee extensors (p > 0.05). However, compared with SST, AR promoted a significantly better restoration of MVF of knee flexors (p < 0.05) after +72 hours from the match. Because muscle fatigue has been related with increased hamstring injury risk, a training based on AR can be a valid intervention to promote the recovery of muscle force production of knee flexors and reduce hamstring injury risk in the postmatch period.","2019","2020-05-20 00:17:52","2020-05-20 00:17:52","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1519/JSC.0000000000003269; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629021359","human; article; soccer; hamstring muscle; injury; knee; controlled study; adolescent; running; height; muscle function; muscle strength; crossover procedure; kinetics; muscle fatigue","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Normal values are defined, showing significant differences from adult athletes. In contrast, there are less data about the diastolic function and the right ventricular (RV) parameters, especially in this age group. There are no specific normal values of these young athletes making differentiation of athlete's heart from pathological conditions challenging. Purpose, methods: The aim of our study was to examine the specific diastolic and RV parameters of peripubertic athletes and compare them to the normal values of adult athletes or healthy non-athletes. We examined 70 children and young adults (athletes, triathletes, soccer players, basketball players) between the age of 9 and 20 years (50 males, 20 females, 16,5 ±2,8 years). 12 leads ECG, specific 2D and tissue Doppler echocardiographic examinations were performed. Results: Examining the left ventricular (LV) structure and function we did not find any significant differences between our results [end-diastolic-diameter (47,1±4,5 mm), end-systolic- diameter (29,4±3,9 mm), LV mass (189,7±60,6 g)] and the latest normal LV values in different age groups. According to the latest studies we also detected a significant positive correlation between the examined LV parameters, age and lean body mass (LBM). We measured significant higher lateral e' (19,8±3,8 cm/s) and septal e' (15,2±2,4 cm/s) values and significant lower E/e' ratio (5,25±1,5) of peripubertic athletes compared to healthy adults, however there were no significant differences between our results and age-matched non-athlete's. Moreover, we found a negative correlation between lateral and septal e' values and age. These results are suggesting that endurance training has no significant impact on the diastolic function in healthy young athletes. Examining the right ventricle we found significant lower structural [RV end-diastolic diameter RVEDD (33,5±3,6 mm)] and functional parameters [ventricular end-diastolic - RVED area (20,5±4,8 cm2), right ventricular end-systolic - RVES area (12,6±3,5 cm2), right ventricular fractional area change (37,8±13%), inferior vena cava diameter [14,5±1,9 mm], tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion - TAPSE (22,7±3,4 mm)] compared to the results of adult athletes. Furthermore, we found significant positive correlations between LBM, RVEDD, RVED area, RVES area and TAPSE. Conclusion: There are no clearly defined normal values of diastolic functional and RV parameters in peripubertic athletes, despite echocardiographic changes could have potentially be found in these population. Well-defined normal ranges can help in daily routine to differentiate physiological changes from pathological heart diseases in young athletes.","2019","2020-05-20 00:17:54","2020-05-20 00:17:54","","S30-S31","","","26","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2047487319860046; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628580982","adult; conference abstract; female; human; male; soccer player; controlled study; major clinical study; young adult; child; electrocardiogram; groups by age; structure activity relation; normal value; heart left ventricle mass; basketball player; heart right ventricle; endurance training; differentiation; heart disease; inferior cava vein; lean body weight; tissue Doppler imaging; triathlete; tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nevertheless, sudden death or medical complications have been reported in SCTc when they are in certain situations such as intense physical exercise. Exercise-induced dehydration is suspected to impair blood rheology in SCTc, which could alter microcirculation. Methods: We 1) compared the effects of dehydration/hydration on blood rheology between SCTc and a control group during a cycling exercise and a soccer game and 2) test the effects of Ramadan on blood rheology in SCTc. Results: Blood viscosity at rest was higher in SCTc than in non-SCTc individuals. In response to cycling exercise, blood viscosity of SCTc remained elevated when they were not allowed to drink. However, when ad libitum water was provided, blood viscosity of SCTc was normalized and comparable to the blood viscosity of non-SCTc. During a soccer game, water deprivation lead SCTc carriers to reach very high values of blood viscosity while adequate hydration caused a decrease in blood viscosity, which was comparable to the one of non-SCTc. We also compared the effect of Ramadan on blood viscosity between SCTc and non-SCTc in the evening and morning. Blood viscosity was not affected by Ramadan in non-SCTc. In contrast, SCTc were characterized by a large increase of blood viscosity in the evening during the Ramadan period. Conclusion: We suspect that dehydration caused by stressful situations could increase the risks for microcirculatory disorders through its impact on blood viscosity. Adequate hydration must be strongly promoted in SCTc during such situations.","2019","2020-05-20 00:17:54","2020-05-20 00:17:54","","","","","227","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/apha.13389; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L631559230","adult; conference abstract; human; soccer; exercise; controlled study; dehydration; water; blood rheology; blood viscosity; sickle cell trait; water deprivation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the effects of ECP on exercise performance and markers of recovery in elite athletes is largely unknown. METHODS: On two separate occasions, 48 h apart, seven elite National Rugby League players performed an identical 60 min field-based conditioning session followed by a 30 min period of either regular ECP treatment or placebo. Power measures during repeated cycle bouts and countermovement jump height and contraction time derivatives were measured at rest, and 5 h post-exercise. Saliva samples and venous blood samples were taken at rest, post-exercise, and 5 h post-exercise to assess stress, inflammation and muscle damage. RESULTS: Post ECP treatment, cycling peak power output (p=0.028; 11%) and accumulated peak power (p=0.027; 14%) increased compared to the placebo condition. Post-exercise plasma Interleukin 1 receptor (IL-1ra) only increased after ECP (p=0.024; 84%) and concentrations of IL-1ra tended to be higher (p=0.093; 76%) 5 h post-exercise. Furthermore, testosterone to cortisol ratio was increased above baseline and placebo 5 hours post-exercise (p=0.017 to 0.029; 24 to 77%). Post-exercise salivary alpha amylase to Immunoglobulin A ratio decreased after treatment (p=0.013; 50%), compared with the placebo control.

In a dog model of compartment syndrome and in a rat contused skeletal muscle injury model, the significant effects of HBO2 therapy on the reduction of edema and muscle necrosis have been reported. In basic research HBO2 therapy stimulated fibroblast activity to improve the healing process. Because of this it expected that HBO2 therapy might improve focal edema and pain in the acute phase and accelerate the healing of injured tissues in athletes with a medial collateral ligament (MCL) injury of the knee. This study aimed to examine the short-term effects of HBO2 application subjectively, and the long-term effects of HBO2 therapy in Japanese professional or semi-professional rugby players with grade 2 MCL injury of the knee. Methods: Thirty-two professional or semi-professional rugby players with grade 2 MCL injury of the knee were investigated. First, in the HBO2 group (n=16), HBO2 therapy was performed during the acute phase. Visual analog scales (VASs) immediately before and after HBO2 therapy on the same day were compared. Next, we retrospectively evaluated the time to return to play in the HBO2 (n=16) and non-HBO2 (n=16) groups. Results: VAS scores for pain while walking immediately before and after HBO2 therapy on the same day were 37.4 ± 20.1 (mean ± standard deviation) and 32.4 ± 21.8, respectively (p⟨0.001). The VAS scores for pain while jogging were 50.7 ± 25.6 and 43.9 ± 25.0, respectively (p⟨0.001). The time to return to play was 31.4 ± 12.2 days in the HBO2 group and 42.1 ± 15.8 days in the non-HBO2 group, indicating a significant difference between the groups (p⟨0.05). Conclusion: HBO2 therapy may reduce pain and accelerate the return to play in athletes with grade 2 MCL injury of the knee in this non-randomized study.","2019","2020-05-20 00:17:56","2020-05-20 00:17:56","","647-654","","5","46","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629762530","adult; human; male; football; injury; return to sport; young adult; physiology; jogging; walking; procedures; classification; case control study; comparative study; wound healing; Asian continental ancestry group; hyperbaric oxygen therapy; Japan; joint instability; knee medial collateral ligament; musculoskeletal pain; pain measurement","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: A total of 27 rugby league players competing in the Super League U19s Championship were randomized to VBT (n = 12) or PBT (n = 15). Both groups completed a 7-wk resistance-training intervention (2×/wk) that involved the back squat. The PBT group used a fixed load based on a percentage of 1-repetition maximum (1-RM), whereas the VBT group used a modifiable load based on individualized velocity thresholds. Biomechanical and perceptual data were collected during each training session. Back-squat 1-RM, countermovement jump, reactive strength index, sprint times, and back-squat velocity at 40-90% 1-RM were assessed pretraining and posttraining. RESULTS: The PBT group showed likely to most likely improvements in 1-RM strength and reactive strength index, whereas the VBT group showed likely to very likely improvements in 1-RM strength, countermovement jump height, and back-squat velocity at 40% and 60% 1-RM. Sessional velocity and power were most likely greater during VBT compared with PBT (standardized mean differences = 1.8-2.4), while time under tension and perceptual training stress were likely lower (standardized mean differences = 0.49-0.66). The improvement in back-squat velocity at 60% 1-RM was likely greater following VBT compared with PBT (standardized mean difference = 0.50). CONCLUSION: VBT can be implemented during the competitive season, instead of traditional PBT, to improve training stimuli, decrease training stress, and promote velocity-specific adaptations.","2019","2020-05-20 00:17:57","2020-05-20 00:17:57","","1-8","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1123/ijspp.2019-0058; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629742631","human; article; rugby; clinical article; controlled study; season; velocity; randomized controlled trial; resistance training; stress; tension","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we examined the results of vitamin D measurements of athletes from different disciplines in different months and aimed to determine if the synthesis of vitamin D decreases or not according to exercise environment and month. Methods: The study was conducted in participants aged 5–52 years. A total of 555 elite-level sportsmen who were admitted to our Sports Medicine Clinic in the study participated in this study. Indoor and outdoor environmental and seasonal effects on the measurements in different months were statistically evaluated. Independent-samples test and definitive statistics were used for statistical analyses and a p-value less than 0.05 has been considered significant. Results: The study group consisted of 229 male and 326 female athletes. The serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration was observed; 120 (21.6%) athletes have severe serum vitamin D deficiency (<11–20 ng/mL). Vitamin D levels were not significantly different from outdoor athletes (393; 70.8%). Winter measurements of vitamin D levels were significantly lower than those measured in autumn (p = 0.000). Conclusion: Increasing vitamin D levels are very important especially in participating athletes and additional supplements are recommended whenever necessary. Gender and indoor/outdoor sports participation showed no statistically significant outcomes on vitamin D levels. However, winter season had a negative effect on vitamin D levels. Therefore, adequate precautions should be taken to increase vitamin D, especially during winter, to maintain the best performance of the athletes.","2019","2020-05-20 00:17:57","2020-05-20 00:17:57","","","","","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2050312119837480; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L626743276","adult; female; human; male; article; football; basketball; priority journal; controlled study; major clinical study; sport; adolescent; athlete; retrospective study; child; volleyball; vitamin D; physical education; 25 hydroxyvitamin D; vitamin blood level; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; mass spectrometer; ballet dancer; indoor sport; outdoor sport; seasonal variation; vitamin D deficiency; Zivak Tandem Gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2019-The first aim of this study was to quantify and compare asymmetries among professional soccer and cricket athletes. The second aim was to examine the association between asymmetries and performance within both groups. Professional soccer (n = 18) and cricket (n = 23) athletes performed single-leg countermovement jumps, single-leg drop jumps (SLDJs), a 10-m sprint, and 505 change of direction speed (CODS) tests. Interlimb asymmetries were calculated as a standard percentage difference, Mann-Whitney U tests conducted to establish systematic bias between groups, and Spearman's r correlations used to establish the relationship between asymmetry scores and speed and CODS performance. Soccer athletes sprinted faster, jumped higher, and had a greater reactive strength index (RSI) score than cricket athletes (p < 0.05). However, cricketers showed reduced ground contact times compared with footballers during the SLDJ (p < 0.05). The cricket group showed significantly greater jump height (asymmetry = 11.49 vs. 6.51%; p = 0.015) and RSI (asymmetry = 10.37 vs. 5.95%; p = 0.014) asymmetries compared with soccer players. These metrics were also associated with slower 505 times in the cricket group only (r = 0.56 -0.74; p < 0.01). These results show that between-limb asymmetries exhibit no association with speed and CODS in elite soccer players but are associated with reduced CODS in elite cricketers. Thus, the reduction of interlimb asymmetries may be of greater consideration when working with cricket vs. soccer athletes.","2019","2020-05-20 00:17:58","2020-05-20 00:17:58","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1519/JSC.0000000000003135; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L627504683","football player; human; article; soccer player; acceleration; clinical article; controlled study; height; leg; contact time; rank sum test; statistical bias","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: 62 volunteer soccer players from Cayyolu Sports Club were included in our study. Players were randomly allocated into two groups; a Kinesio taping (KT) (n=31), and a control group (n = 31). KT application including gastrocnemius and quadriceps femoris muscle facilitation techniques were applied to the first group. The second group was set as the control group and no application was made. Sociodemographic characteristics, postural stability and thermographic assessment were evaluated prior to and after the application of the Kinesio Taping. All the statistical analyses were set a priori at an alpha level of p<0.05. The tests for homogeneity (Levene’s test) and normality (Shapiro-Wilk) were used to determine the appropriate statistical methods to apply for comparison between the groups. According to the test results, the parametric paired sample T-test was used to compare between baseline and post-treatment within a group, while independent sample T-test for equality of means was used for comparison between the groups. Results: No statistically significant differences were observed between the groups at baseline regarding age, body mass index, skin temperature and postural stability (p > 0.05). Statistically significant differences were found in all the assessed parameters in both Kinesio Taping and control groups (all p<0.05) except thermal imaging of dominant gastrocnemius muscle results (p=0.668) after the Kinesio application. Statistically significant differences were found in all parameters across groups (all p<0.05). Conclusions: Kinesio Taping may increase postural stability and decrease the risk of injury. According to thermal imaging assessments, both quadriceps and gastrocnemius muscles may be active in maintaining postural stability. As the decreasing risk of injury is very important for young soccer players, our results may show a preventive measure for sports physiotherapists working on soccer fields.","2019","2020-05-20 00:17:58","2020-05-20 00:17:58","","169-174","","1","35","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.19193/0393-6384_2019_1_27; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L626114978","human; article; soccer player; skin temperature; controlled study; adolescent; body mass; age; double blind procedure; gastrocnemius muscle; quadriceps femoris muscle; pressure; body position; FLIR E5; kinesio taping; NCT02683434; physical medicine; thermographic imaging system; thermography; treatment outcome","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: A total of 19 professional soccer players from the same soccer club (age = 17.1 [0.3] y, height = 1.76 [0.69] m, and body mass = 69.7 [9.4] kg) participated in this study. Players performed 4 × 30-s (150 s recovery) all-out 1-vs-1 SSG considering 300, 200, and 100 m2 per player (48 h apart). Players' external loads were tracked with global positioning technology (20 Hz). Heart rate, blood lactate concentration (BLc), and rating of perceived exertion characterized players' internal load. Peak BLc was assessed with a 30-s all-out test on a nonmotorized treadmill (NMT). RESULTS: SSG300 produced higher BLc than SSG200 (moderate) and SSG100 (large). The SSG300, SSG200, and SSG100 BLc were 97.8% (34.8%), trivial; 74.7% (24.9%), moderate; and 43.4% (15.7%), large, of the NMT30s peak BLc, respectively. Players covered more distance at high intensity during the SSG300 than in other SSG conditions (huge to very large differences). High-intensity deceleration distance was largely lower in SSG200 than in SSG300. SSG100 elicited very large to huge and large to very large lower external load values than SSG300 and SSG200, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The main finding of this study showed an inverse association between ball-drill density and internal/external loads in long sprint ability-oriented SSG. The SSG300 provided BLc closer to individual maximal, thus satisfying the all-out construct assumed for the development of long sprint ability. Further studies using the SSG300 as a training intervention and/or investigating other different SSG formats using the same density are warranted.","2019","2020-05-20 00:17:59","2020-05-20 00:17:59","","1265-1272","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1123/ijspp.2018-0645; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629461808","human; article; football; soccer player; heart rate; controlled study; deceleration; high intensity interval training; endurance; pitch; human tissue; lactate blood level; treadmill; anaerobic capacity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Participants were 7 female collegiate players. Each day, training and match loads were recorded during a 6-day period that included two competitive matches (separated by 66 hours) using a GPS, acceleration, and heart rate monitoring, and perceptual recovery scores. Gait was examined before each training session, during a 400 m run at comfortable pace. Spatiotemporal characteristics were computed using continuous wavelet transform, and gait complexity was assessed with detrended fluctuation analysis. High match load (HML) players played more minutes than the low match load (LML) players (78.6 ± 4.9 vs 15.8 ± 4.9 minutes, P < 0.05) and covered more total distance (TotDist) between the initial and final session (31970.5 ± 13190.9 vs 22905.5 ± 1673.1 m, P < 0.05). During this period, greater accumulated TotDist and recovery scores were associated with decreases in the gait fractal scaling index (r = −0.5 to −0.83), despite little change in spatiotemporal characteristics. This study indicates increased load during a 6-day period of training and matches alters gait complexity. It is possible that some aspect of central and/or peripheral fatigue alters motor control leading to less structured gait variability.","2019","2020-05-20 00:18:00","2020-05-20 00:18:00","","130-137","","3","2","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L626360094; http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/tsm2.67","adult; female; human; article; soccer; soccer player; clinical article; heart rate; priority journal; controlled study; training; warm up; contact time; gait; continuous wavelet transform; cool down; gait complexity; motor control; signal processing; spatiotemporal analysis; step time; stride time","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A controlled and counterbalanced cross-over design was adopted consisting of three visits with a 1-week interval between sessions. Twenty (20) professional soccer male athletes participated in three randomized conditions divided into three visits: control, 15-min Stroop task, and 30-min Stroop task. Inhibitory control was accessed by the Stroop task (accuracy and response time) before and after induced mental fatigue protocol. The athletes played a training match (90-min) following the experimental conditions. The Game Performance Assessment Instrument (GPAI) was used for the passing decision-making analysis. The GPAI analysis showed impaired passing decision-making performance following the 30-min Stroop task compared with the 15-min and control condition (F(2,17) = 6.99, p = .01). Moreover, an increase in response time during the Stroop task was found following 30-min Stroop task condition (F(2,17) = 6.57, p = .03) compared to 15-min of Stroop task and control conditions. Prolonged cognitive tasks may be considered a mediating factor in passing decision-making performance in male professional soccer athletes throughout a full-length training match. Thus, athletes should avoid highly demanding-cognitive tasks before a soccer match. Future studies are required to explore more ecological cognitive tasks to induce mental fatigue (i.e. smartphones and video-games) and their effects on other performance indicators (e.g., physical, technical, tactical) in a full-length training match setting.","2019","2020-05-20 00:18:02","2020-05-20 00:18:02","","1-21","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17461391.2019.1656781; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629109216","adult; human; male; article; soccer; controlled study; athlete; decision making; randomized controlled trial; reaction time; sports psychology; smartphone; dysthymia; Stroop test; video game","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Objectives: The objectives of this study were to determine the effects of a 6-week neuromuscular training program on agility performance, and to determine differences in movement times between the slower and faster turning directions in elite soccer players. Materials and Methods: Twenty male elite soccer players from the Stade Rennais Football Club (Ligue 1, France) participated in this study. The players were randomly assigned to a neuromuscular training group (NTG, n = 10) or an active control (CG, n = 10) according to their playing position. NTG participated in a 6-week, twice per week neuromuscular training program that included CoD, plyometric and dynamic stability exercises. Neuromuscular training replaced the regular warm-up program. Each training session lasted 30 min. CG continued their regular training program. Training volume was similar between groups. Before and after the intervention, the two groups performed a reactive agility test that included 180° left and right body rotations followed by a 5-m linear sprint. The weak side was defined as the left/right turning direction that produced slower overall movement times (MT). Reaction time (RT) was assessed and defined as the time from the first appearance of a visual stimulus until the athlete's first movement. MT corresponded to the time from the first movement until the athlete reached the arrival gate (5 m distance). Results: No significant between-group baseline differences were observed for RT or MT. Significant group x time interactions were found for MT (p = 0.012, effect size = 0.332, small) for the slower and faster directions (p = 0.011, effect size = 0.627, moderate). Significant pre-to post improvements in MT were observed for NTG but not CG (p = 0.011, effect size = 0.877, moderate). For NTG, post hoc analyses revealed significant MT improvements for the slower (p = 0.012, effect size = 0.897, moderate) and faster directions (p = 0.017, effect size = 0.968, moderate). Conclusion: Our results illustrate that 6 weeks of neuromuscular training with two sessions per week included in the warm-up program, significantly enhanced agility performance in elite soccer players. Moreover, improvements were found on both sides during body rotations. Thus, practitioners are advised to focus their training programs on both turning directions.","2019","2020-05-20 00:18:05","2020-05-20 00:18:05","","","","JUL","10","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2019.00947; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628686002","adult; human; male; article; football; soccer player; clinical article; controlled study; team sport; randomized controlled trial; warm up; agility; effect size; reaction time; rotation; physician; post hoc analysis; France; hemispheric dominance; movement time; visual stimulation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Subjects were evaluated in two rounds with normal sleep and deprivation of night sleep (DNS) and between these two rounds was also a recovery week. The evaluations included physical performance and appetite. Results: DNS had a significant effect on appetite (feeling hungry, full, satiate, and eating desire), reaction time, balance (static and dynamic), anaerobic power (peak power, minimum power, average power, and fatigue index), and aerobic performance (p=0.05). Conclusion: DNS may induce disruptions on the appetite and physical performance of elite soccer players. For these, athletes should take into consideration adequate night sleep before performing physical tasks. Amaç: Uyku ve uyanma; fizyolojik fonksiyonlardan, aydınlık ve karanlıktan, çalışma programlarından ve diğer etkinliklerden etkilenen biyolojik bir döngüdür. Vücut fonksiyonlarında ve iştahta uykunun hayati önemi vazgeçilmezdir ve bu özellikle sporcular için önemlidir. Bu arada, futbol oyuncularının şartları uykudan yoksun kalacakları şekildedir ve bu profesyonel bir sporcu için risktir. Bu çalışmada, seçkin kadın futbol oyuncularında gece uyku yoksunluğunun iştah ve fiziksel performans üzerindeki etkilerinin incelenmesi amaçlanmıştır. Gereç ve Yöntem: Araştırmaya, İran birinci liginde 10 yıllık geçmişi olan 12 seçkin kadın futbol oyuncusu seçildi (yaş: 28,50±3,45 yıl, boy: 160,50±4,07 cm, kilo: 55,12±3,52 kg, beden kitle indeksi: 21,38±1,06 kg/m2). Denekler normal uyku ve gece uykusu yoksunluğu ile iki seansta değerlendirildi ve bu iki seans arasında bir iyileşme haftası da vardı. Değerlendirmelere fiziksel performans ve iştah dahil edildi. Bulgular: Gece uykusu yoksunluğunun; iştah (acıkma, doyma, tokluk hissi ve yeme arzusu), reaksiyon süresi, denge (statik ve dinamik), anaerobik güç (tepe güç, minimum güç, ortalama güç ve yorgunluk indeksi) ve aerobik performans üzerinde önemli bir etkiye sahip olduğu gözlendi (p=0,05). Sonuç: Gece uykusu yoksunluğu, seçkin futbol oyuncularının iştahı ve fiziksel performansı üzerinde bozulmalara neden olabilmektedir. Bundan dolayı, sporcular fiziksel görevlerine başlamadan önce yeterli gece uykusunu göz önünde bulundurmalıdırlar.","2019","2020-05-20 00:18:09","2020-05-20 00:18:09","","93-96","","3","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","","","","https://gateway.library.qut.edu.au/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=c8h&AN=138861888&site=ehost-live&scope=site","Adult; Female; Soccer; Human; Descriptive Statistics; Fatigue; Aerobic Capacity; Appetite -- Evaluation; Athletes, Elite -- Psychosocial Factors; Athletes, Female -- Psychosocial Factors; Balance, Postural; Body Height; Body Mass Index; Body Weight; Circadian Rhythm; Hunger; Physical Performance -- Evaluation; Reaction Time; Satiation; Sleep Deprivation -- Complications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the real difference that the respiratory system may present between the two populations has yet to be established. This study aimed at evaluating the effects of physical activity on aerobic capacity, pulmonary function and respiratory muscle strength by determining thecorrelation among athletes and sedentary people. Methods:The study sample consisted of 20 male individuals aged 18-24 years, divided into two groups: Athlete group-AG (n = 10), and Sedentary group-SG(n = 10).Respiratory evaluation was performed through spirometry and manovacuometry. The Bruce treadmill test was used for evaluation of cardiac function. Results:The comparison between AG and SG showed a significant increase (p (0.05) with regards to the following variables: maximum volume (V) of oxygen (O2) (AG = 79.31; SG = 72.40 ml/kg.min); forced vital capacity (AG = 5.76; SG = 4.93L); forced expiratory volume in 1 second (AG = 5.10; SG = 4.41 L); inspiratory muscle strength (AG =-108; SG =-90 cmH2O); positive correlation between maximum oxygen volume and the other variables. Conclusion:The results showed that the football-related physical activities have improved the aerobic capacity, the pulmonary function and the inspiratory muscle strength, demonstrating a positive correlation between these variables.

A validated automatic tracking system (Venatrack) was used to code player actions in real time for passing accuracy, cross accuracy, corner accuracy and free kick accuracy. In total 376 of the 380 games played during the 2011-12 English premier League season were recorded, resulting in activity profiles of 570 players and over 35'000 rows of data. These data were analysed using multi-level modelling. Multi-level regression revealed a ""u"" shaped association between passing accuracy and goal difference (GD) with greater accuracy occurring at extremes of GD e.g., when the score was either positive or negative. The same pattern was seen for corner accuracy away from home e.g., corner accuracy was lowest when the score was close with the lowest accuracy at extremes of GD. Although free kicks were not associated with GD, team ability, playing position and pitch location were found to predict accuracy. No temporal variables were found to predict cross accuracy. A number of score line effects were present across the temporal factors which should be considered by coaches and managers when preparing and selecting teams in order to maximise performance. The current study highlighted the need for more sensitive score line definitions in which to consider score line effects.","2019","2020-05-20 00:18:12","2020-05-20 00:18:12","","","","2","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0211707; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L626232831","human; article; soccer player; season; multilevel analysis; pitch; manager","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Athletes were randomly divided into PT (horizontal and vertical drills) and OPL (squat+hip thrust exercises at the load of maximum power output) interventions, applied over 7 weeks during the in-season period. Squat (SJ) and countermovement (CMJ) jumps, maximal sprint (10 and 30 m) and change of direction (COD; agility T test) were the pre-and post-training measured performance variables. Magnitude-based inference was used for within-and between-group comparisons. RESULTS: OPL training induced moderate improvements in vertical SJ (ES:0.97; 90%CI:0.32-1.61) and CMJ (ES:1.02; 90%CI:0.46-1.57), 30 m sprint speed (ES:1.02; 90%CI:0.09-1.95) and COD performance (ES:0.93; 90%CI:0.50-1.36). After PT training method, vertical SJ (ES:1.08; 90%CI:0.66-1.51) and CMJ (ES:0.62; 90%CI:0.18-1.06) were moderately increased, while small enhancements were noticed for 30 m sprint speed (ES:0.21; 90%CI:-0.02-0.45) and COD performance (ES:0.53; 90%CI:0.24-0.81). The 10 m sprint speed possibly increased after PT intervention (small ES: 0.25; 90%CI:-0.05-0.54), but no substantial change (small ES:0.36; 90%CI:-0.40-1.13) was noticed in OPL. For between-group analyses, the COD ability and 30 m sprint performances were possibly (small ES:0.30; 90%CI:-0.20-0.81; Δ=+1.88%) and likely (moderate ES:0.81; 90%CI:-0.16-1.78; Δ=+2.38%) more improved in the OPL than in the PT intervention, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The two different training programs improved physical performance outcomes during the in-season period. However, the combination of vertically-and horizontally-based training exercises (squat+hip thrust) at optimum power zone led to superior gains in COD and 30 m linear sprint performances.","2019","2020-05-20 00:18:14","2020-05-20 00:18:14","","1-27","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1123/ijspp.2019-0039; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L627865937","adult; human; male; article; soccer player; hip; controlled study; season; physical performance; velocity; randomized controlled trial; agility; jumping; plyometrics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The demands put on players of different positional roles can be manipulated in training through small-sided and conditioned games and so players' tactical behaviours might be stimulated. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of positional role in tactical behaviour of U-17 youth soccer players based on core tactical principles in a four-a-side small-sided and conditioned game. The sample was comprised of 268 U-17 youth Brazilian soccer players. They were of five positional roles: centre backs; fullbacks; defensive midfielders; offensive midfielders; and forwards. The instrument used to collect and analyse data was the System of Tactical Assessment in Soccer (FUT-SAT). Results revealed that players of different positional roles showed no differences in the quantity of tactical actions performed. However, forwards showed lower quality of tactical behaviour in the defensive phase (M=69.1, SD=16.0; p<.05) compared to fullbacks (M=77.0, SD=13.1; p<.05) and performed worse in actions far from the ball that ensured team cohesion in the defensive phase (M=69.7, SD=22.8; p<.05) compared to fullbacks (M=80.1, SD=18.4; p<.05). This study showed that the four-a-side format allows U-17 players to perform a similar quantity of tactical actions regardless of their positional role, but the player's positional role influence quality of their tactical behaviour. Therefore, this structure might be used for trainings that promotes similar tasks and stimuli for players' development that do not focus on specific tactical roles.

Twenty male soccer players (age = 18.9 ± 0.9 years, body mass = 71.8 ± 5.2 kg, height = 178.2 ± 6.3 cm) randomly performed four experimental conditions before RSA test (six sets of 40 m): (I) placebo (PLA) control, (II) CHO mouth rinse (6% maltodextrin), (III) PAP + PLA, and (IV) PAP + CHO. The PAP protocol involved two sets of five repetitions (80% 1RM) of the back squat exercise. A one-way repeated measures analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni post hoc test was used to compare the experimental conditions. Results indicated that PAP + CHO and PAP + PLA had better results for the variables best sprint time, mean sprint time, and total sprint time compared with CHO and PLA (p<0.001; small effect size). No significant interaction between the experimental conditions was observed for the variable RSA performance decrement, and no significant difference between conditions, i.e., PAP + CHO vs. PAP + PLA and CHO vs. PLA control was found. In conclusion, PAP positively affects RSA performance in soccer players; however, the combination of PAP and CHO mouth rinse showed no additional effect.

Methods: Eight elite soccer players (age: 21.0 ± 0.4 years) performed a modified Loughborough Intermittent Shuttle Test protocol (LISTmod) on two occasions: 1 week before (BR) and during the fourth week of Ramadan (End-R). At BR and End-R, soccer players performed squat jump, countermovement jump, maximal voluntary contraction, and 20 m sprint, and creatine kinase, uric acid, and subjective ratings (feelings scale, quality of sleep, fatigue, muscle soreness and stress) were assessed at baseline and 0, 24, 48, and 72 h following LISTmod. Results: Following LISTmod, performance in squat jump (48 and 72 h) (p < 0.05), countermovement jump (48 and 72 h), maximal voluntary contraction (0, 24, 48, and 72 h), and 20 m sprint (0 and 48 h) decreased significantly on both occasions. Decreases were higher at End-R than BR. Creatine kinase levels increased significantly at 24 and 48 h at BR and End-R (p < 0.05). Uric acid increased at 0 and 24 h only on BR. Muscle soreness increased throughout the recovery period at both occasions, with a higher level at End-R. Stress rating increased only at 0 h on End-R, while fatigue rating increased at 24 h at BR and at 0, 24, and 48 h at End-R. Conclusion: Perturbations in physical performance and subjective ratings parameters were higher at the end of Ramadan.

Methods: Seventeen Division-I collegiate soccer players were recruited. Two data collection sessions were conducted. The first data collection occurred prior to the start of the soccer season. Each subject completed a brief questionnaire, had height and weight measured, underwent a clinical assessment of their anterior cruciate ligaments and an eight sequence magnetic resonance imagery of their knees. Contours of the anterior cruciate ligaments were outlined in sagittal T-2 weighted MR images and volumes were calculated using Medical Image Processing, Analysis, and Visualization software. Presence or absence of edema within the ligament was determined in pre and post season scans. All subjects were followed during the season to determine if a lower extremity injury had been sustained. Results: Mean ligament volume significantly increased from preseason to postseason (p=.006). There was a 10% increase in the percentage of knees with edema pre to post season. Conclusions: The physical demand of a competitive soccer season in female collegiate athletes appears to cause an increase in volume of the anterior cruciate ligament. The increase in volume may be related to the accumulation of microscopic tears over the course of the season which induce inflammation and edema. The volumetric changes in the ligament may have significant clinical implications, however further studies must be done to determine the relationship between anterior cruciate ligament volume and risk of injury.","2019","2020-05-20 00:18:34","2020-05-20 00:18:34","","","","1","6","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L627012277; http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40634-019-0182-8","adult; female; human; article; soccer player; knee; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; clinical article; priority journal; training; body mass; young adult; follow up; questionnaire; anterior cruciate ligament injury; clinical assessment; leg injury; image processing; anterior cruciate ligament; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; edema; social participation; Vantage 1.5 Tesla","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A 2 × 2 mixed design was applied, manipulating the level of training in self-regulatory processes between groups and the moment of evaluation within groups. Participants were 13 under-15 year-old male soccer players from Montevideo, Uruguay, with an average of 9.38 years of competitive experience. The experimental group went through 10 individual weekly sessions of training in self-regulatory processes comprising 11 out of 18 self-regulatory processes presented in Zimerman's Multiphasic Cycle of Self Regulatory Processes. Greater improvement on the cognitive representation of tactics was observed in the experimental group, which revealed more functionally organized clustering of offensive and defensive team-specific tactical concepts in long-term memory after the training. Results showed significant differences in the organization of tactical knowledge in long-term memory due to the participation in a training program on self-regulatory processes focusing on tactical actions in soccer. This study extended the effects of self-regulatory processes, previously evidenced in specific situations in other sports, to the organization of tactics mental representation in soccer. The effects are related to the facilitation of learning processes caused by the use of self-regulatory processes. The systematic application of learning strategies adapted to tactical situations seemed to enable participants to organize tactical knowledge in long-term memory. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR La présente étude vise à démontrer la relation entre les variables cognitives et comportementales qui configurent la performance d'un expert en vérifiant si les processus d'autorégulation de l'apprentissage influenceraient l'organisation de la représentation mentale des tactiques au football. Un modèle de type 2 × 2 a été appliqué en manipulant le niveau des processus d'autorégulation de l'apprentissage entre les groupes et le moment de l'évaluation au sein des groupes. Les participants étaient 13 joueurs masculins de moins de 15 ans de Montevideo, Uruguay, avec une moyenne de 9,38 ans d'expérience en compétition. Le groupe expérimental a suivi 10 semaines de séance individuelle d'apprentissage dans les processus d'autorégulation comprenant 11 sur 18 processus d'autorégulation présentés dans le cycle multiphasique de l'autorégulation de Zimmerman. Une grande amélioration sur la représentation cognitive des tactiques du groupe expérimental révélant un regroupement plus fonctionnel et organisé des méthodes tactiques offensives et défensives dans la mémoire à long terme après l'apprentissage a été observée. Les résultats ont montré des différences significatives dans l'organisation des connaissances tactiques dans la mémoire à long terme du fait de la participation à un programme d'apprentissage sur les processus d'autorégulation portant sur les tactiques de football. Cette étude a étendu les effets des processus d'autorégulation, antérieurement prouvés dans des situations spécifiques dans d'autres sports, à l'organisation de la représentation mentale des tactiques de football.

Thirty-four male division I under-19 players (16.64 ± 0.81 years) agreed to participate in the study. They were randomly divided into an experimental group (EG) and a control group (CG). The first group (EG) followed a 6-week supervised slackline training program (3 sessions/week; 5-9 min/session), while the CG performed only regular soccer training. Several variables were assessed in all participants: acceleration (20-m sprint test), agility (90º turns test), jump performance (squat jump, countermovement jump), and postural control (Center of Pressure (CoP) testing: length, area, speed, Xmean, Ymean, Xspeed, Yspeed, Xdeviation, Ydeviation). Ratings of perceived exertion and local muscle ratings of perceived exertions were also recorded after each slackline training session. At post-tests, there was a significant increase only in the EG in acceleration, agility, squat jump and countermovement jump performance, as well as several CoP variables: area in the bipedal support on a firm surface, and length, area and speed in the left leg on a firm surface. The program was rated as ""somewhat hard"" by the players, while quadriceps, gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior were the most exerted muscles while slacklining. In conclusion, slackline training can be an effective training tool for young, high-level soccer players.

METHODS: Football clubs (under-9, under-11 and under-13 age groups) from the Czech Republic, Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland were cluster-randomised (clubs) into an intervention (INT) and a control group (CON). INT replaced their usual warm-up by '11+ Kids' two times a week. CON followed their regular training regime. Match and training exposure and injury characteristics were recorded and injury incidence rates (IRs) and 95% CIs calculated. For the present analysis, only severe injuries (absence from training/match ≥28 days) were considered. Hazard ratios (HR) were calculated using extended Cox models. RESULTS: The overall IR of severe injuries per 1000 football hours was 0.33 (95% CI 0.25 to 0.43) in CON and 0.15 (95% CI 0.10 to 0.23) in INT. There was a reduction of severe overall (HR 0.42, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.72), match (0.41, 0.17 to 0.95) and training injuries (0.42, 0.21 to 0.86) in INT. The injury types that were prevented the most were: other bone injuries 66%, fractures 49% and sprains and ligament injuries 37%. Severe injuries located at the knee (82%), hip/groin (81%), the foot/toe (80%) and the ankle (65%) were reduced tremendously. CONCLUSIONS: '11+ Kids' has a large preventive effect on severe injuries by investing only 15 to 20 min per training session. The present results should motivate coaches to implement effective injury prevention programmes such as the '11+ Kids' in children's football.

This article deals with the issue of the effects of stretching on the level of explosive strength abilities in the lower limbs in warm-up. We know from a large amount of scientific studies that dynamic stretching has a positive effect on most sport performances (especially power and speed sports) rather than static stretching. Dynamically stretched muscles produce more power primarily because of the increased activation of the motor units. Higher performance during fast dynamic exercise is related to higher activation of the central nervous system. Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) seems to be an optimal method of stretching when trying to increase joint mobility in the joint-muscle unit, where muscle contraction is used, followed by a relaxation phase and the subsequent stretching of the muscle. Aim of Study. The aim of this study is to compare the impact of dynamic and PNF stretching on explosive strength abilities of the lower limbs in active hockey players (n = 19, weight 84.7 ± 6.4 kg, height 179.8 ± 3.1 cm) and football (soccer) players (n = 23, weight 77.6 ± 5.1 kg, height 175.5 ± 4.3 cm) ranging in age from 18 to 26. Material and Methods. The PNF method of Sölveborn was used, a method characterized by the physiological knowledge that a muscle significantly decreases its tone after isometric contraction is applied. This was compared in our research to the use of dynamic stretching during warmup. We used the following motor exams for testing the explosive strength of the lower limbs -- a standing long jump (rebound with feet together) and a vertical jump (Sargent test). Results. We can state from the results of the parametric t-test that on the chosen level of significance (p < 0.05) practically significant differences were noted in the application of dynamic and PNF stretching in the hockey players' vertical jump, and in addition to this, that the observed differences were substantively significant. For soccer players there are no statistically different results in the vertical jump test (p < 0.05) and that the participants have similar results after both dynamic and PNF stretching exercises. Conclusions. The impact of the acute application of dynamic stretching on explosive strength abilities in the lower limbs of hockey players was significantly more effective than the application of the PNF stretching technique in the vertical jump test performances. The experiment confirmed the short-term effect of the application of dynamic stretching on the explosive strength of the lower limbs of hockey players.

The purpose of this study was to assess the short and long-term effects of the FIFA 11+ on knee strength, and muscle latency after sudden inversion of amateur futsal players. METHODS: Seventy-one male futsal players were recruited and randomized to a FIFA 11+ (n = 37, age: 27.0 ± 5.1 years) and a control group (n = 34, age: 26.0 ± 5.1 years). The FIFA 11+ programme was executed twice a week, for 10 weeks, followed-up after 10 weeks where both groups executed regular warm-ups. Concentric and eccentric isokinetic knee muscle strength was tested and latency time of the evertor muscles after sudden inversion of the ankle was executed with a trapdoor mechanism following an EMG protocol of selected leg muscles (peroneus brevis and peroneus longus). RESULTS: No significant difference were observed between groups for short-term changes in isokinetic strength after adjustment for baseline differences. At long-term, significant gains were obtained after adjustment for baseline differences in eccentric strength for both lower limbs as for the H/Q ratios for the dominant limb. No changes between groups were observed in the peroneus brevis and peroneus longus latency time. CONCLUSIONS: Performing FIFA 11+ did not have short-term effects on knee strength and muscle latency after sudden inversion in amateur futsal players. However, significant long-term benefits were observed for eccentric strength and H/Q ratios.  Highlights The FIFA 11+ induced significant long-term benefits in eccentric strength in amateur futsal players. The FIFA 11+ also improved long-term benefits in H/Q conventional and functional ratios of the knee of amateur futsal players The enhancements observed with the application of the FIFA 11+ in amateur futsal players may bring benefits in injury reduction.","2019","2020-05-20 00:18:48","2020-05-20 00:18:48","","1-11","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17461391.2019.1609588; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L627867650","adult; human; article; injury; knee; clinical article; controlled study; muscle training; randomized controlled trial; warm up; muscle strength; ankle; leg muscle; latent period","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A total of 280 youth players from 11 Spanish under 12 football teams participated in 22 games. The players' positional data were gathered and several pitch position-derived variables were computed for the team in possession. The level of the players (i.e. regional vs. local), age group (under 11 vs. under 12) and game format were used as factors. The results showed that most skilled and older players were more efficient in covering the available space in both game scenarios while in the offensive phase, what may suggest higher tactical awareness. These findings show that players may face different tactical problems during 7- and 8-a-side formats promoting adaptations in their dynamical positioning. Overall, specific features of these factors need to be considered to better design football learning programmes.

Male football players (n = 29, age 16.51 ± 0.7 years) in a regional professional league and male healthy control subjects (n = 30, age 17.1 ± 1 years) participated to the study. Blood cortisol, testosterone, and growth hormone (hGH) concentrations were assayed before the beginning of the training period (T0), just after the training period (T1), at the middle of the season (T2), and at the end of the season (T3). In each period physical tests and anthropometric measurements were also performed. Results showed significant differences in basal values of cortisol, testosterone, and growth hormone (hGH) in the four time points evaluated (P < 0.01). In addition, the concentrations of hGH were higher in the soccer players group than in control subjects (P < 0.001). Between the start of the training period and the end of the football season significant differences were observed in the anthropometric characteristics and in the physical form of the football players. Furthermore, the hormonal status was significantly correlated with the indicators of the lower limb power (squat-jump [SqJ], and counter-movement-jump [CMJ]) and those of aerobic performance (Yo–Yo intermittent recovery test level 1 (YYIRT1) and maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max)).These data underscore the importance of establishing training protocols that present the potential to promote positive adaptations without, at the same time, provoking overtraining of young players.","2019","2020-05-20 00:18:51","2020-05-20 00:18:51","","20685-20693","","11","234","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jcp.28673; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628694471","football player; human; male; article; lower limb; soccer player; oxygen consumption; priority journal; controlled study; physical performance; adolescent; fitness; Italy; testosterone; hydrocortisone; hydrocortisone blood level; movement (physiology); endurance training; anthropometric parameters; physical capacity; seasonal variation; concentration process; hormonal regulation; hormone metabolism; human growth hormone; overexertion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The observed neural adaptions are specific to the sport and manifested in those brain regions which are associated with neuronal processing of sport-specific skills. Techniques of non-invasive brain stimulation have been shown to induce neuroplastic changes and thereby also facilitate task performance. In the present study, we investigated the influence of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the leg area of the primary motor cortex (M1) on simple reaction time tasks (RTT) and tapping tasks (TT) as a comparison between trained football (FB) and handball players (HB) and non-athletes (NA). We hypothesized that anodal tDCS over M1 (leg area) would lead to specific behavioral gains in RTT and TT performance of the lower extremity as compared to sham condition. On an exploratory level, we aimed at revealing if trained athletes would show stronger tDCS-induced behavioral gains as compared to NA, and, furthermore, if there are any differential effects between FB and HB. A total number of 46 participants were enrolled in a sham-controlled, double-blinded, cross-over study. A test block consisting of RTT and TT was performed before, during, after as well as 30 min after a 20-min tDCS application. Additionally, the specificity of tDCS-induced changes was examined by testing upper extremity using the same experimental design as a control condition. Our data showed no group- or sport-specific tDCS-induced effects (online and offline) on RTT and TT neither for lower nor upper extremities. These findings indicate that neither athletes nor NA seems to benefit from a brief period of tDCS application in speed-related motor tasks. However, more knowledge on neuronal processing of RTT and TT performance in trained athletes, the influence of tDCS parameters including stimulation sites, and the effect of inter-individual differences are required in order to draw a comprehensive picture of whether tDCS can help to enhance motor abilities on a high-performance level.","2019","2020-05-20 00:18:53","2020-05-20 00:18:53","","","","","13","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00103; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002235083","adult; female; human; human experiment; male; article; football; upper limb; clinical article; controlled study; athlete; velocity; leg; motor performance; experimental design; double blind procedure; transcranial direct current stimulation; exploratory research; primary motor cortex; simple reaction time","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Twenty-four female soccer players (age, 15.08 ± .88 yrs) participated in 4 randomly ordered experimental conditions: (a) control containing 5-min jog; (b) 5-min jog and 6 repetitions of DS (DS-6); (c) 5-min jog and 12 repetitions of DS (DS-12); and (d) 5-min jog and 18 repetitions of DS (DS-18). ROM, RT, and MT were measured following all conditions. Flexibility increased following all DS conditions compared to the control. Moreover, MT was significantly improved after DS-6 and DS-12 compared to the control values, but there were no significant differences between DS-18 and control. In relation to RT, there were no significant differences between the experimental conditions. These results suggest that a DS protocol of 6 repetitions results in similar increases in ROM compared to 12 and 18 repetitions. In addition, dynamic stretch volumes with more than 18 repetitions may impair MT. According to the results of the study, the optimal volume of DS to improve active ROM and MT seems to be between 6 to 12 repetitions.

However, to date, only Beato and collaborators have examined the effects of once-a-week RS on physical fitness, even though this frequency is widespread among participants. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the effect of weekly performed RS intervention on components of physical fitness in sedentary young men. Twenty-healthy men aged 20-27 years were randomly assigned to a soccer (n=10) group or a control (n=10) group. Participants in the soccer group played a 60-min. small-sided soccer game once-a-week for eight weeks. Before and aft er the intervention period, body composition, aerobic fitness, blood pressure, anaerobic performance and isokinetic leg strength were assessed. Aft er eight weeks of the once-a-week intervention period, in the soccer group, body fat and thickness of skinfolds were significantly decreased (p<0.05). Peak oxygen uptake, running distance, squat and countermovement jump (p<0.01), concentric quadriceps and eccentric hamstring strength were also improved only in the soccer group (p<0.05). In contrast, other variables, including body mass (BM), body mass index (BMI), fat-free mass (FFM), heart rate responses, blood pressure, and anaerobic performance remained the same as before the intervention period (p>0.05). Participating in weekly RS programme can lead to some health and performance benefits. However, the people who wish to further improve their health status and performance level should increase the frequency of RS activity.

The relationship has been identified in both epidemiology and laboratory research. It has been shown that a warm up program including neck strengthening can reduce concussion incidence, however no strength measures were reported. This study looks to identify if a isometric, field based warm up can improve neck strength in an Australian football cohort. Methods: Two adolescent, semi-elite Australian football teams, each consisting of 26 players were cluster randomised to an intervention and control arm. Participants performed isometric neck strength and anthropometry measures before and after an 11-week neck strengthening program performed during the competition season. Neck strength was assessed using hand-held dynamometry (Lafayette, Model 01163, USA) in flexion, extension and left and right lateral flexion as well as left and right axial rotation. The program consisted of progressive, self-resisted isometric neck exercises conducted as part of the teams standard training warm-ups. Changes in neck strength and girth were assessed using a linear mixed model with session and intervention as the fixed effects and club and subject as the random effects Results: There was a significant interaction effect for time and group. Post hoc analysis found the intervention group showed a significant increase in mean peak force in flexion (Δx̅ = 4.56kg, p < 0.001), extension (Δx̅ = 3.88kg, p < 0.001, right lateral flexion (Δx̅ = 4.69kg, p < 0.001), left lateral flexion (Δx̅ = 3.26kg, p < 0.001), right axial rotation (Δx̅=4.66kg, p < 0.001) and left axial rotation (Δx̅ ̅=3.64kg, p < 0.001) following the intervention. There was no morphological differences observed in neck girth in both groups. Discussion: The ecologically valid, isometric neck strengthening intervention produced significantly increased isomeric neck strength in all directions in an adolescent Australian football population. However it is not know if this increase in strength was associated with reduction in concussion risk in the population. Previous work has suggested this link but further research is needed to investigate if an intervention targeting neck strength can both increase strength and reduce concussion risk.","2019","2020-05-20 00:19:00","2020-05-20 00:19:00","","S47","","","22","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsams.2019.08.229; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002914910","conference abstract; female; human; male; football; case report; clinical article; incidence; season; competition; adolescent; concussion; randomized controlled trial; warm up; rotation; anthropometry; dynamometry; post hoc analysis; neck; isomerization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Visual analog scale (VAS) was used for pain evaluation and the Nirschl Pain Phase Scale (NPPS) used for the evaluation of functional impairment due to pain. RESULTS All VAS and NPPS scores were significantly better after each injection compared with baseline (P<0.05). The VAS score reduced from 51.7±1.82 to 2.83±1.29. In addition, NPPS score was reduced from 4.44±0.92 to 2.01±0.84. CONCLUSIONS This study showed that DPT can be an effective method for reducing pain and functional improvement of patients with OP.","2019","2020-05-20 00:19:01","2020-05-20 00:19:01","","438-443","","6","178","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002136689; http://dx.doi.org/10.23736/S0393-3660.18.03838-X","sports medicine; adult; human; male; article; soccer player; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; clinical article; exercise; scoring system; athlete; questionnaire; retrospective study; physiotherapy; physician; visual analog scale; glucose; inguinal pain; musculoskeletal disease assessment; function test; palpation; thigh muscle; rectus abdominis muscle; 23 gauge needle; adductor magnus muscle; bilateral adductor contraction test; chronic osteitis pubis; gracilis muscle; isometric adductor contraction test; lateral compression test; leg length inequality; needle; Nirschl Pain Phase Scale; osteitis; pain assessment; paracetamol plus tramadol; pes cavus; prolotherapy; pubic symphysis gap test; pubis symphysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

De la concepción teórica al diseño práctico. / Game models in soccer. From theoretical conception to practical design","Retos: Nuevas Perspectivas de Educación Física, Deporte y Recreación","","15791726","","","In recent years, we have identified a trend towards a change in the concepts and methodologies of soccer training. The traditional paradigm has given way to new proposals that understand the game from a holistic perspective. This break has led to the emergence of new ways of conceiving training. These training methods are close to each sport’s specificity. One of the methods that has raised more interest, due to its repercussions in professional soccer thanks to successful coaches, is the Tactical Periodization. This idea is based on the conception of game model as a fundamental element from which different game patterns grow, each of them needing to be reproduced later in the training. On account of a lack of practical proposals showing clear guidelines for the development of a game model, we try to present a personal design starting from i) a conceptual analysis of the game model, ii) the identification of the elements that this model needs to show, and iii) a practical development of each element, which serves as route map for those professionals who wish to delve into this training approach in soccer. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR En los últimos años hemos visto una tendencia hacia un cambio en los conceptos y metodologías de entrenamiento de fútbol. El paradigma tradicional ha dado paso a nuevas propuestas que entienden el juego desde un plano holístico. Esta ruptura ha supuesto la aparición de nuevas formas de concebir el entrenamiento, emergiendo métodos de entrenamiento que se acercan a la especificidad del deporte. A día de hoy, contamos con diversos métodos de trabajo, entre los cuales podríamos citar el microciclo estructurado y la periodización táctica como lo que mayor interés y repercusión han suscitado debido a su utilización por entrenadores de éxito. En este sentido, la periodización táctica se fundamenta en la concepción del modelo de juego como elemento fundamental de donde parten los diferentes patrones de juego que deben ser reproducidos posteriormente en el entrenamiento. Debido a la falta de propuesta prácticas que manifiesten pautas claras para el desarrollo de un modelo de juego, en este trabajo trataremos de llevar a cabo un diseño propio a partir de i) un análisis conceptual sobre el modelo de juego, ii) identificación de los elementos que este debe de contener y iii) desarrollo práctico de cada uno de los elementos que sirva como hoja de ruta para aquellos profesionales que quieran profundizar en esta forma de concebir el entrenamiento en fútbol.

Purpose: To describe the epidemiological patterns of elbow injuries in NCAA athletes during 5 seasons over the academic years 2009 through 2014 using the NCAA Injury Surveillance Program (NCAA-ISP) database. Study Design: Descriptive epidemiology study. Methods: A voluntary convenience sample of NCAA varsity teams from 11 sports was examined to determine the rates and patterns of elbow injuries. Rates and distributions of elbow injuries were identified within the context of sport, event type, time in season, mechanism, time lost from sport, surgical treatment, and injury type. Rates of injury were calculated as the number of injuries divided by the total number of athlete-exposures (AEs). An AE was defined as any student participation in 1 NCAA-sanctioned practice or competition with an inherent risk of exposure to potential injury. Injury rate ratios (IRRs) and injury proportion ratios (IPRs) were then calculated to compare the rates within and between sports by event type, season, sex, mechanism, surgical treatment, and time lost from sport. Comparisons between sexes were made using only sports data that had both male and female samples. Results: Overall, 373 elbow injuries were reported in the NCAA-ISP data set during the 2009-2010 through 2013-2014 academic years among 11 varsity sports. The overall rate of injury was 1.76 per 10,000 AEs. The rate of elbow injuries in men was 0.74 per 10,000 AEs, while women experienced injuries at a rate of 0.63 per 10,000 AEs. In sex-comparable sports, men were 1.17 times more likely to experience an elbow injury compared with women. Men’s wrestling (6.00/10,000 AEs) and women’s tennis (1.86/10,000 AEs) were the sports with the highest rates of elbow injuries by sex, respectively. The top 3 highest injury rates overall occurred in men’s wrestling, baseball, and tennis. Elbow injuries were 3.5 times more likely to occur during competition compared with practice. Athletes were 0.76 times less likely to sustain an elbow injury during the preseason compared with in-season. Contact events were the most common mechanism of injury (67%). For sex-comparable sports, men were 2.41 times more likely than women to have contact as their injury mechanism (95% CI, 0.78-7.38). The majority of athletes missed less than 24 hours of participation time (67%), and only a minority (3%) of patients with elbow injuries went on to have surgical intervention. Elbow ulnar collateral ligament injuries were most common (26% of total injuries). Conclusion: Analysis of the study data demonstrated a significant rate of elbow injuries, 1.76 injuries per 10,000 AEs in NCAA collegiate athletes. Higher injury rates can be expected in males within sex-comparable sports. Elbow injuries are most common in the setting of competitions and most commonly occur secondary to contact-type mechanisms. Injuries were more likely to occur during in-season play. The majority of injuries required less than 24 hours of time away from sport and did not require surgical intervention.","2019","2020-05-20 00:19:07","2020-05-20 00:19:07","","","","8","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2325967119861959; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628852934","female; human; male; article; football; sport injury; priority journal; tennis; major clinical study; prospective study; competition; athlete; body weight; recurrent disease; wrestling; sporting event; baseball; lacrosse (sport); athletic trainer; sex ratio; seasonal variation; social participation; disease surveillance; elbow injury","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of our study was to investigate the prevalence of cardiac abnormalities in a population of young male soccer players undergoing pre-participation screening through electrocardiogram and trans-thoracic echocardiography. Methods: All consecutive male football players undergoing pre-participation screening comprehensive of medical history, physical examination, 12-lead electrocardiogram and trans-thoracic echocardiography at the FMSI Sport Medicine Institute in Rome between January 2008–March 2009 were enrolled in the study. Results: Overall, 2261 consecutive young athletes aged 12.4 ± 2.6 years were evaluated. Training-unrelated electrocardiogram abnormalities were observed in 65 (2.9%) athletes. Abnormal trans-thoracic echocardiography was observed in 102 athletes (4.5%), including two cases of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, eight of mild left ventricular hypertrophy, six of mild left ventricular dilation and 17 of bicuspid aortic valve. An abnormal electrocardiogram was associated with anomalous trans-thoracic echocardiography in 11/65 (16.9%) cases. All athletes requiring sport disqualification were identified by electrocardiogram. Notably, among 2216 athletes with a normal electrocardiogram, 91 had abnormal trans-thoracic echocardiography, including six cases of left ventricular dilation and six of ventricular hypertrophy. Conclusions: In a wide population of peri-pubertal male athletes, evaluation of the electrocardiogram identified all cardiac diseases requiring sport disqualification. Trans-thoracic echocardiography alone allowed the identification of cardiac abnormalities potentially leading to cardiomyopathies or major cardiovascular events over time.","2019","2020-05-20 00:19:09","2020-05-20 00:19:09","","1444-1455","","13","26","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2047487319826312; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L626236936","sports medicine; football player; human; male; article; soccer player; priority journal; body mass; race; child; blood pressure; electrocardiogram; prevalence; fatigue; bicuspid aortic valve; transthoracic echocardiography; physical examination; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; echocardiography; heart left ventricle hypertrophy; medical history; screening; dyspnea; cardiovascular disease; family history; heart palpitation; thorax pain; hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; electrocardiography; heart disease; cardiomyopathy; funnel chest; heart atrium septum defect; heart death; heart murmur; heart sound; heart ventricle extrasystole; heart ventricle hypertrophy; heat syncope; Marfan syndrome; patent ductus arteriosus; presyncope; pulmonary vascular disease; single photon emission computed tomography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DESIGN: A cross-sectional study of ECGs and ECHOs conducted as part of precompetition medical assessment for national male soccer teams preparing for various Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) tournaments in 2016 and 2017. SETTING: Ghana National Football Association. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred fifty-nine players playing for the National male soccer teams preparing for tournaments in 2016 and 2017. INTERVENTIONS: Precompetition medical assessment using ECGs and ECHOs. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Number of athletes with abnormal ECGs and ECHO findings. RESULTS: Twenty-three percent of the players had abnormal ECGs. Nine percent of the participants had T-wave inversions in lateral leads (V5-V6). Sokolow-Lyon criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy were present in 64% of participants. Thirty-six (23%) players had left ventricular wall thickness (LVWT) ≥13 mm, with no player exceeding 16 mm.

METHODS Sixteen varsity high-school football athletes underwent baseline neurocognitive testing and blood sampling for the biomarkers tau, ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCH-L1), neurofilament light protein (NF-L), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and spectrin breakdown products (SBDPs). All athletes wore helmet-based accelerometers to measure and record head impact data during all practices and games. At various time points during the season, 6 of these athletes met the criteria for HHI (linear acceleration > 95g and rotational acceleration > 3760 rad/sec2); in these athletes a second blood sample was drawn at the end of the athletic event during which the HHI occurred. Five athletes who did not meet the criteria for HHI underwent repeat blood sampling following the final game of the season. In a separate analysis, all athletes who did not receive a diagnosis of concussion during the season (n = 12) underwent repeat neurocognitive testing and blood sampling after the end of the season. RESULTS Total tau levels increased 492.6% ± 109.8% from baseline to postsession values in athletes who received an HHI, compared with 164% ± 35% in athletes who did not receive an HHI (p = 0.03). Similarly, UCH-L1 levels increased 738.2% ± 163.3% in athletes following an HHI, compared with 237.7% ± 71.9% in athletes in whom there was no HHI (p = 0.03). At the end of the season, researchers found that tau levels had increased 0.6 ± 0.2 pg/ml (p = 0.003) and UCH-L1 levels had increased 144.3 ± 56 pg/ml (p = 0.002). No significant elevations in serum NF-L, GFAP, or SBDPs were seen between baseline and end-of–athletic event or end-of-season sampling (for all, p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS In this pilot study on asymptomatic football athletes, an HHI was associated with increased markers of neuronal (UCH-L1) and axonal (tau) injury when compared with values in control athletes.

Also, to determine if implementation of a proprioceptive and ankle strengthening program would reduce the risk for concussion in this population. Methods: This study was a retrospective review of preseason BESS scores and injury reports from 2014 to 2015 football seasons with the primary outcome of interest being in season concussions. A secondary analysis was performed with the 2016, 2017 and 2018 data in which a prophylactic ankle strengthening and proprioceptive program was implemented in those with BESS scores greater than or equal to 15. Results: In the control group (2014-2015 seasons), the odds of concussion during the season in players with BESS score greater than or equal to 15 was 1.35 [95% CI, 0.53-3.29]. Risk of concussion in players with elevated BESS scores who were given an ankle rehabilitation program was 0.15. In comparison to those without the ankle rehabilitation program, risk of concussion was 0.10. Relative risk of concussion in those with ankle rehab versus no rehab was 1.59 (95% CI, 0.42-5.85). Conclusions: Elevated BESS scores greater than or equal to 15 were not predicative of increased risk for concussion. When ankle rehabilitation was implemented in those with a BESS score greater than or equal to 15,a reduced risk for concussion was not found. Significance: There is a need for continued evaluation of modifiable risk factors to decrease the risk of concussions in athletes.","2019","2020-05-20 00:19:15","2020-05-20 00:19:15","","134-135","","2","29","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/JSM.0000000000000724; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629860505","conference abstract; football player; human; controlled study; season; concussion; outcome assessment; retrospective study; ankle; risk factor; secondary analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is estimated that (4-9) % of players suffer concussive injuries every year. Concussion is largely a clinical diagnosis based on injury, neurologic examination and neuropsychological testing. Blood-based biomarkers could complement the clinical evaluation and guide management decisions. Circulating miRNAs have been reported as biomarkers of several diseases due to their stability and ease of detection. Earlier, we have reported a panel of miRNAs as to detect mild to severe TBI. In this prospective study, we assessed the performance of a novel panel of serum microRNA (miRNA) biomarkers of indicators of concussion, sub-concussive impacts, and neurocognitive function in NCAA collegiate football players. 30 nonathlete control subjects and 23 male collegiate student football athletes participated in this study. Neurocognitive assessments and blood samples were taken within the week before the athletic season began and within the week after the last game and a pre-selected panel of miRNA biomarkers was measured. Elevation of miRNAs was observed in all the athletes at the beginning of the season compared to control subjects. Athletes with the lowest standardized assesment score (SAC) at the beginning of the season had the highest level of miRNA expression. Increased miRNA expression were found to be associated with a declining neurocognitive function. The results of this study suggest that miRNAs are good indicators of sub-concussive and concussive injuries and can be further explored for concussion biomarkers.","2019","2020-05-20 00:19:16","2020-05-20 00:19:16","","A103","","13","36","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2019.29100.abstracts; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628868367","adult; conference abstract; female; football player; human; male; clinical article; controlled study; prospective study; season; concussion; human tissue; biological marker; clinical evaluation; diagnosis; student; microRNA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Male collegiate student football athletes participating in a Division I Football Bowl Subdivision of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) were enrolled. There were a total of 53 participants included in the study, 30 non-athlete control subjects and 23 male collegiate student football athletes. Neurocognitive assessments and blood samples were taken within the week before the athletic season began and within the week after the last game of the season and measured for a panel of pre-selected miRNA biomarkers. All the athletes had elevated levels of circulating miRNAs at the beginning of the season compared with control subjects (p < 0.001). Athletes with the lowest standard assessment of concussion (SAC) scores at the beginning of the season had the highest levels of miRNAs. The area under the curve (AUC) for predicting pre-season SAC scores were miR-195 (0.90), miR-20a (0.89), miR-151-5p (0.86), miR-505∗ (0.85), miR-9-3p (0.77), and miR-362-3p (0.76). In athletes with declining neurocognitive function over the season, concentrations of miRNAs increased over same period. There were significant negative correlations with miR-505∗ (p = 0.011), miR-30d (p = 0.007), miR-92 (p = 0.033), and (p = 0.008). The miRNAs correlating with balance problems were miR-505∗ (p = 0.007), miR-30d (p = 0.028), and miR-151-5p (p = 0.023). Those correlating with poor reaction times were miR-20a (0.043), miR-505∗ (p = 0.049), miR-30d (p = 0.031), miR-92 (p = 0.015), and miR-151-5p (p = 0.044). Select miRNAs were associated with baseline concussion assessments at the beginning of the season and with neurocognitive changes from pre to post-season in collegiate football players. Should these findings be replicated in a larger cohort of athletes, these markers could potentially serve as measures of neurocognitive status in athletes at risk for concussion and subconcussive injuries.","2019","2020-05-20 00:19:18","2020-05-20 00:19:18","","1343-1351","","8","36","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2018.6072; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L627184084","adult; female; football player; human; male; article; brain concussion; clinical article; observational study; controlled study; prospective study; athlete; cohort analysis; prediction; blood sampling; receiver operating characteristic; reaction time; risk factor; traumatic brain injury; protein blood level; biological marker; area under the curve; brain function; unclassified drug; microRNA; balance disorder; disorders of higher cerebral function; health care organization; microRNA 151 5p; microRNA 195; microRNA 20a; microRNA 30d; microRNA 362 3p; microRNA 505; microRNA 9 3p; microRNA 92; neurocognitive assessment; neurologic examination; Single National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I Season; standard assessment of concussion score; subconcussive trauma","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The research questions guiding the study were: (a) how did female elite soccer players perceive that their psychosocial experiences were related to their cognitive, physiological, and emotional states prior to their ACL injuries, and (b) how did the players feel their perceived states influenced their behaviours prior to injury occurrence. The participants consisted of the total population of female players (N = 18) competing in the Swedish women's elite league, who incurred a total ACL tear during the 2012 season. Using a semi-structured interview guide, all players were interviewed post-season. We represented the data using a storytelling approach of aggregated creative nonfiction. The aggregated stories showed sociocultural rules and expectations of overtraining and placing pressure on athletes to play even if they were not physically or psychologically fit. Responding to pressures with potentially risk-increasing behaviours might raise the probability of becoming injured through a number of pathways. Team managers, coaches, and members of the medical team are recommended to develop environments that stimulate the players to engage in adaptive stress-recovery and risk-decreasing behaviours.

The aim of this study was to conduct a comprehensive assessment of players' opinions to better understand the influence of playing surfaces on the game of football and identify factors that may contribute to differences of opinion. Method: Qualitative data were collected from 103 elite footballers and 21 coaching staff during a series of interviews and focus groups. A thematic analysis was conducted to identify patterns in the data. Results: Players considered that the type and condition of a playing surface influenced ball-surface interactions, game play, tactics/strategy, footwear selection, movement, risk of injury and fatigue. Together these influence a player's perception of the suitability of a surface and also their mindset, which could ultimately affect their performance. Conclusion: The majority of participants in this study expressed a higher preference for natural grass over artificial turf pitches. A perceived increased risk of injury on artificial turf remains a primary concern despite a lack of supporting evidence in research studies. To address this discrepancy, the reporting of muscle soreness and the effect of constant surface switching merit further consideration. Not all participants shared the same views and player characteristics such as age, surface experience, injury history and playing style/position were found to be potential factors that could account for differences in elite players' opinions regarding the surfaces used in football.","2019","2020-05-20 00:19:24","2020-05-20 00:19:24","","1-13","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02701367.2019.1660757; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629692941","adult; football player; human; article; soccer; injury; controlled study; perception; fatigue; pitch; interview; nonhuman; qualitative research; thematic analysis; muscle; grass; shoe","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Morbidity and mortality weekly report","","1545-861X","10.15585/mmwr.mm6810a2","","Traumatic brain injuries (TBIs), including concussions, are at the forefront of public concern about athletic injuries sustained by children. Caused by an impact to the head or body, a TBI can lead to emotional, physiologic, and cognitive sequelae in children (1). Physiologic factors (such as a child's developing nervous system and thinner cranial bones) might place children at increased risk for TBI (2,3). A previous study demonstrated that 70% of emergency department (ED) visits for sports- and recreation-related TBIs (SRR-TBIs) were among children (4). Because surveillance data can help develop prevention efforts, CDC analyzed data from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System-All Injury Program (NEISS-AIP)* by examining SRR-TBI ED visits during 2010-2016. An average of 283,000 children aged <18 years sought care in EDs each year for SRR-TBIs, with overall rates leveling off in recent years. The highest rates were among males and children aged 10-14 and 15-17 years. TBIs sustained in contact sports accounted for approximately 45% of all SRR-TBI ED visits. Activities associated with the highest number of ED visits were football, bicycling, basketball, playground activities, and soccer. Limiting player-to-player contact and rule changes that reduce risk for collisions are critical to preventing TBI in contact and limited-contact sports. If a TBI does occur, effective diagnosis and management can promote positive health outcomes among children.","2019","2020-05-20 00:19:26","2020-05-20 00:19:26","","237-242","","10","68","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6810a2; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L626806097","female; human; male; sport injury; statistics and numerical data; adolescent; child; recreation; United States; traumatic brain injury; infant; preschool child; hospital emergency service; newborn","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Eighteen young male soccer players were assigned at random to two experimental groups: E1—undertaking a six 30 s one-on-one SSGs with a 2 min rest period; and E2—playing six 45 s SSGs with a 3 min rest interval. Capillary blood was collected from the players at rest, after the last game, and 15 and 30 min after the exercise protocol. The variables assessed included serum cortisol (C), free testosterone (FT) and total testosterone (TT). An effect was observed between the measurement times (TT (F = 15.26, p ≤ 0.0001), FT (F = 6.86, p = 0.0006)).

This observational study aimed to assess EE and dietary intake over a 14-day period in a representative group (n = 41) of professional football players playing in the Dutch Premier League (Eredivisie). Daily EE, as assessed by doubly labelled water, was 13.8 ± 1.5 MJ/day, representing a physical activity level (PAL) of 1.75 ± 0.13. Weighted mean energy intake (EI), as assessed by three face-to-face 24-h recalls, was 11.1 ± 2.9 MJ/day, indicating 18 ± 15% underreporting of EI. Daily EI was higher on match days (13.1 ± 4.1 MJ) compared with training (11.1 ± 3.4 MJ; P < 0.01) and rest days (10.5 ± 3.1 MJ; P < 0.001). Daily carbohydrate intake was significantly higher during match days (5.1 ± 1.7 g/kg body mass (BM)) compared with training (3.9 ± 1.5 g/kg BM; P < 0.001) and rest days (3.7 ± 1.4 g/kg BM; P < 0.001). Weighted mean protein intake was 1.7 ± 0.5 g/kg BM. Daytime distribution of protein intake was skewed, with lowest intakes at breakfast and highest at dinner. In conclusion, daily EE and PAL of professional football players are modest. Daily carbohydrate intake should be increased to maximize performance and recovery. Daily protein intake seems more than adequate, but could be distributed more evenly throughout the day.","2019","2020-05-20 00:19:30","2020-05-20 00:19:30","","2759-2767","","24","37","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02640414.2019.1576256; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629641984","adult; human; male; soccer; adolescent; athlete; young adult; caloric intake; protein intake; administration and dosage; carbohydrate diet; nutrition; diet; energy metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This research note reports the findings from an investigation on whether planning for an inevitable resource loss event (i.e., retirement from professional sport) can accrue gains (i.e., sporting performance). Data for this study was sourced from the National Rugby League, a top-level men's professional sports league in Australasia, and included 28,516 performance selection observations for 632 players over three seasons. The findings demonstrated that higher levels of engagement in preretirement planning were positively associated with team selection, team tenure, and career tenure. Preretirement planning was also found to exert its effect on performance through the experience of career transition practitioners and the number of intervention support sessions the athletes participated in.

Thirtyfour male soccer players (20 ± 4 years) performed a 20 m sprint test measured by timing gates (TG), and while wearing the PTPS. To evaluate the relevance of additional velocitybased parameters to discriminate between faster and slower athletes, the median-split method was applied to the 20-m times. Practical relevance was estimated using standardized mean differences (d) between the subgroups. Differences between the criterion reference (TG) and PTPS for the 10 and 20 m splits did not vary from zero (dt10: -0.01 ± 0.07 s, P = 0.7, d < -0.1; dt20: -0.01 ± 0.08 s, P = 0.4, d < -0.2). Although subgroups revealed large differences in their sprint times (d = -2.5), the average accelerations between 5 and 20 km/h as well as 20 and 25 km/h showed merely small effects (d < 0.5). Consequently, analyses of velocity curves derived from PTPS may help to clarify the occurrence of performance in outdoor sports. Thus, training consequences can be drawn which contribute to the differentiation and individualization of sprint training.","2019","2020-05-20 00:19:37","2020-05-20 00:19:37","","","","5","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0217782; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002056461","adult; human; male; article; soccer player; acceleration; validity; differentiation; individualization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Importantly, players involved in Street football may develop a strong emotional bond to the game through their experiences playing in an informal setting and eventually this could support their participation in a more structured playing environment. However, nowadays, talented children have reduced opportunities to play the game in this informal environment and instead, are mostly experiencing the game through their participation in organised settings such as in youth football clubs and academies. Importantly, such structured and formal environments afford the children a more rigid and less representative learning environment, which could potentially inhibit the development of creativity and adaptability among these young players. Purpose: The current paper aims to discuss the importance of Street football to players' development and the role of a Nonlinear Pedagogy (NLP) framework to support the design of a player-centred and game-based approach that can contribute to enhance learning of creative and adaptive behaviours in football. Discussion: Pedagogical principles of NLP (representative learning design, information-movement couplings, manipulation of constraints, exploratory learning and reducing conscious control of movement) underpinned by concepts from Ecological Dynamics and working through pedagogical channels (instruction, feedback and practice) can facilitate the design of representative training tasks to enhance learning. NLP emphasises a learner-centred approach and highlights the critical role that the practitioner plays as a facilitator in providing learners with meaningful practice that leads to effective transfer of game-play behaviours. Street football affords features that capture some of the above key pedagogical principles and presents a suitable platform to support the acquisition of game-play behaviour that is meaningful for the individual learner. Conclusions: Through a recognition of the current need to design a football learning environments that capture key elements of Street football, we highlight the relevance of NLP as a pedagogical framework to underpin a learner-centred and game-based approach, supporting practitioners with a set of pedagogical principles. Thus, we propose that through this representative learning environment we can enhance learning in football and contribute to the development of intelligent and creative players.

Objectives: The aim of this study was to describe the epidemiological features of injuries among professional Brazilian soccer players in relation to location, type, mechanism, severity, recurrence, treatment and, lastly, symptoms in return to sport. Study design: Descriptive and cross-sectional, observational study. Study center: School of Physical Therapy of the University of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. Methods: 116 male professional athletes of teams from a Brazilian state championship were interviewed and information about injuries was recorded using a retrospective reported morbidity questionnaire. Data were analyzed in mean ± SD for physical characteristics and sports practice history in absolute and relative frequencies (chi-square test with Bonferroni's correction) for characterization of soccer injuries in terms of type, location, severity, recurrence and symptoms in return to sport. Results: The numbers of injuries per athlete and per injured athlete were 0.92 and 1.43 respectively. The injuries of muscle-tendon unit and the joint types localized on lower limbs constituted the most important clinical occurrences with significant difference both in relation to other types (p < 0.05). Moderate and severe injuries were the most frequent occurrences. In relation to mechanisms for each type of injury, body contact was at least three times more responsible for injury cases. This type of mechanism was associated with a significantly greater impairment of joint structures. Concerning occurrence and recurrence of cases, the number of recurrent injuries of the muscle-tendon unit reached about 7.5% of the first-time injuries, while the number of joint recurrent injuries integrated almost 40% of the first-time cases. Significant differences between first-time injuries and recurrent injuries were found only for muscle-tendon and joint structures (p < 0.05), while significant differences among the type of injuries within each type of occurrence (first-time or recurrent injuries) were also found between muscle-tendon and joint injuries (p < 0.05). In relation to athletes with symptoms, in return to sport, 77.6% of them were treated for their injuries but more than half of them returned with symptoms still present when compared to those who returned without any symptoms. Among athletes who did not receive treatment, a lower percentage (58.3%) returned to the sport with symptoms still present. Significant associations between treatment and symptomatology were not found.","2019","2020-05-20 00:19:45","2020-05-20 00:19:45","","374-379","","2","10","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcot.2018.05.006; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2000777093","adult; female; human; male; article; lower limb; soccer; upper limb; observational study; controlled study; major clinical study; training; performance; athlete; young adult; cross-sectional study; recurrent disease; physiotherapy; physician; physiotherapist; anthropometry; middle aged; demography; interview; morbidity; tendon; injury severity; Brazilian; descriptive research; asymptomatic disease; consensus development; emergency care; epidemiological monitoring; research; symptomatology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: This was a retrospective analysis of shoulder dislocations encountered in the ED from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) from 1997 to 2016. Results: A total of 37 851 visits were recorded in the NEISS database, representing a national estimate of 1 549 005 shoulder dislocations (95% CI, 1 226 436-1 871 574). More than half (54.6%) were sports-related. Football (16.3%), basketball (15.8%) and cycling (9.0%) were the sports most commonly associated with dislocation. The majority of dislocations (72.7%) occurred in men. This difference was more significant for sports-related injuries (86.2% in men) than non-sports-related injuries (56.5%, P < 0.001). The mean patient age was 34.6 years. People under the age of 21 experienced a significantly higher proportion of sports-related dislocations (44.6%) than people over the age of 39 (14.4%, P < 0.001), while the opposite distribution is seen for nonsports related dislocations (12.2% vs 50.8%, P < 0.001). Conclusions: This study describes the epidemiology and etiology of shoulder dislocations presenting to the ED. More than half of these injuries occurred during sports-related activities. In general, men experience more shoulder dislocations than women, though this difference is less significant among non-sports-related injuries. Younger people are more likely to dislocate their shoulder participating in sports than in non-sports-related activities. Significance: This study highlights the demographics and activities in which shoulder dislocations are most often seen in US EDs. Hopefully this data can be used for future studies targeted at shoulder dislocation prevention strategies, especially in athletics.","2019","2020-05-20 00:19:47","2020-05-20 00:19:47","","160","","2","29","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/JSM.0000000000000726; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629860163","adult; conference abstract; female; human; male; football; basketball; clinical article; controlled study; young adult; retrospective study; athletics; United States; prevention; emergency ward; shoulder dislocation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Match play and training data from a total of 3677 players from 61 teams across 17 countries have been included. Team medical staff recorded player exposure and time loss injuries. Injury incidence was defined as the number of injuries per 1000 player-hours. Injury burden was defined as number of days absence per 1000 player-hours. Seasonal trends for isolated syndesmotic injury incidence, isolated syndesmotic injury proportion of ankle ligament injuries and isolated syndesmotic injury burden were analysed via linear regression. RESULTS: The isolated syndesmotic injury incidence was 0.05 injuries per 1000 hours of exposure (95% CI 0.04 to 0.06) or one injury per team every three seasons. The injury incidence during match play was 13 times higher compared with during training, 0.21 (95% CI 0.16 to 0.26) and 0.02 (95% CI 0.01 to 0.02), respectively. Out of the 1320 ankle ligament injuries registered during the 15 seasons, 94 (7%) were diagnosed as isolated syndesmotic injuries. An annual increase in injury incidence was observed (R2=0.495, b=0.003, 95% CI 0.001 to 0.004, P=0.003). However, no significant annual change of injury burden was observed (R2=0.033, b=0.032, 95% CI -0.073 to 0.138, P=0.520). Seventy-four per cent of the injuries were contact related, and the mean (±SD) absence following an isolated syndesmotic injury was 39 (±28) days. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of isolated syndesmotic injuries in elite professional European football annually increased between 2001 and 2016.","2019","2020-05-20 00:19:57","2020-05-20 00:19:57","","959-964","","15","53","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bjsports-2017-097710; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628776904","human; male; soccer; injury; exercise; incidence; prospective study; season; return to sport; physiology; competitive behavior; Europe; ankle injury; adverse event; joint ligament","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Rates of injury were calculated as the number of injuries divided by the total number of athlete-exposures (AEs). AEs were defined as any student participation in one NCAA-sanctioned practice or competition.Results.An estimated 7496 cervical spine injuries were identified. Of these, 85.6% were categorized as new injuries. These occurred at a rate of 2.91 per 10000 AEs. Stingers were most common (1.87 per 10000 AEs) followed by cervical strains (0.80 per 10000 AEs). Injuries were nine times more likely to occur during competition when compared with practice settings. When compared with the regular season, the relative risks of sustaining a cervical spine injury during the preseason and postseason were 0.69 (95% CI 0.52-0.90) and 0.39 (95% CI 0.16-0.94), respectively. The rate of cervical spine injuries was highest in Division I athletes. Direct contact-related injuries were most common, representing 90.8% of all injuries sustained. Injuries were most common in linebackers (20.3%) followed secondarily by defensive linemen (18.2%). Most players returned to play within 24hours of the initial injury (64.4%), while only 2.8% remained out of play for > 21 days.Conclusion.Fortunately, the rate of significant and disabling cervical spine injuries appears to be low in the NCAA football athlete. The promotion of safer tackling techniques, appropriate modification of protective gear, and preventive rehabilitation in these aforementioned settings is of continued value.Level of Evidence: 4.","2019","2020-05-20 00:20:03","2020-05-20 00:20:03","","848-854","","12","44","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/BRS.0000000000003008; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629169157","football player; human; male; article; priority journal; incidence; major clinical study; athlete; risk factor; descriptive research; cervical spine injury","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Purpose: To describe the epidemiology of clavicle fractures among high school athletes, including injury rates by sex, sport, and type of play and trends in operative versus nonoperative treatment. Study Design: Descriptive epidemiology study. Methods: The study data set included all athlete-exposure (AE) and clavicle fracture data collected from 2008-2009 through 2016-2017 from a large sample of US high schools as part of the National High School Sports-Related Injury Surveillance Study for students participating in boys’ football, boys’/girls’ soccer, boys’/girls’ basketball, boys’/girls’ volleyball, boys’ wrestling, boys’ baseball, girls’ softball, girls’ field hockey, boys’ ice hockey, boys’/girls’ lacrosse, boys’/girls’ swimming and diving, boys’/girls’ track and field, girls’ gymnastics, girls’ cheerleading, boys’/girls’ tennis, and boys’/girls’ cross-country. Results: Overall, 567 clavicle fractures were reported during 31,520,765 AEs, an injury rate of 1.80 per 100,000 AEs. Injury rates varied by sport, with the highest rates in the boys’ full-contact sports of ice hockey (5.27), lacrosse (5.26), football (4.98), and wrestling (2.21). Among girls’ sports, the highest rates were in soccer (0.92), lacrosse (0.26), and basketball (0.25). In sex-comparable sports, injury rates were still significantly higher among boys (1.03) than girls (0.35) (rate ratio, 2.91; 95% CI, 1.97-4.30). Injury rates were significantly higher in competition (4.58) as compared with practice (0.87) (rate ratio, 5.27; 95% CI, 4.44-6.26). Most injuries were treated conservatively (82.7%) rather than operatively (17.3%).

Conclusion: Although clavicle fracture rates are relatively low, they vary by sport, sex, and activity. Understanding such differences should drive more effective, targeted injury prevention efforts. Increased time loss from sports with surgical versus conservative treatment may have been influenced by factors including injury severity and its timing relative to the season’s progress.","2019","2020-05-20 00:20:05","2020-05-20 00:20:05","","","","7","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2325967119861812; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628686823","female; human; male; article; football; soccer; injury; basketball; priority journal; return to sport; competition; athlete; swimming; volleyball; ice hockey; wrestling; baseball; high school student; clavicle fracture; injury severity; exposure","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, less is known regarding the management, severity, and outcomes of such injuries in contact athletes. Purpose: To compare the incidence, severity, and outcomes of elbow UCL injuries between throwing and contact athletes in collegiate sports. Study Design: Descriptive epidemiology study. Methods: Elbow UCL injuries were queried from the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Injury Surveillance Program between the seasons of 2009-2010 and 2013-2014 in 25 varsity sports. The rates and distribution of injuries by mechanism, participation restriction time, and outcomes (eg, season-ending injury, surgery) were examined. A severe injury was defined as loss of ≥21 days from participation, a season-ending injury, or requiring a surgical intervention. The injury frequency, incidence per 10,000 athlete-exposures (AEs), and injury proportion ratio comparing throwing and contact athletes were calculated with 95% CIs. Results: Over the course of 5 seasons, 109 UCL injuries were recorded, for an overall injury rate of 0.29 per 10,000 AEs. Of these injuries, 83 (76.1%) were a result of contact and 26 (23.9%) from throwing. Men’s wrestling (1.78 per 10,000 AEs) and men’s baseball (1.12 per 10,000 AEs) sustained the highest injury rates. A larger proportion of throwing (n = 8; 36.4%) compared with contact (n = –7; 9.1%) (P < 0.01) injuries results in >21 days of time loss. Additionally, more throwing-related UCL injuries required surgery (n = 2; 11.1%) compared with contact-related injuries (n = 1; 1.3%) (P < 0.01). As a result, throwing athletes demonstrated a significantly higher proportion of severe injuries than contact athletes (injury proportion ratio, 4.62 [95% CI, 1.72-12.40]). Conclusion: The evaluation of athletes in 25 collegiate varsity sports across 5 seasons found over 3 times more elbow UCL injuries in contact versus throwing athletes. However, the number of severe injuries in throwing athletes was significantly higher than in contact athletes. These findings demonstrate that although elbow UCL injuries are prone to occur in both contact and throwing athletes, their prevention, management, and outcomes must be framed on a sport-by-sport basis.","2019","2020-05-20 00:20:06","2020-05-20 00:20:06","","","","4","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2325967119836428; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L627142370","female; human; male; article; football; soccer; hamstring muscle; basketball; priority journal; tennis; sport; athlete; hockey; swimming; volleyball; athletic performance; physical education; wrestling; diving; baseball; softball; throwing; conservative treatment; injury severity; ligament injury; elbow ulnar collateral ligament injury; lacrosse; ulnar collateral ligament (elbow)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There are an estimated 0.12 episodes of instability per 1000 sporting exposures. Instability can lead to time away from sport and an increased risk of shoulder arthritis. Purpose: To determine the prevalence, demographic data, anatomic features, and likelihood of surgery for the different types of instability as defined by the FEDS (frequency, etiology, direction, and severity) classification system for different sports. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: Databases at 3 institutions (University of Iowa, Vanderbilt University, and University of Pennsylvania) were searched for International Classification of Diseases--Ninth Revision codes related to shoulder instability in 2010. Demographic data, symptoms, causes, imaging findings, and operative reports were obtained. Data were entered into a custom-designed REDCap online survey. Patients with subjective instability related to sporting activities were included for analysis. Results: A total of 184 athletes had glenohumeral instability; 20.1% were female. The mean age at the time of the first instability episode was 19.0 years for both male and female patients. The most common sports were football (29.3%), basketball (19.0%), and wrestling (9.8%). The most common type of instability based on the FEDS system was occasional, traumatic, anterior dislocation. Surgery was performed on 69.6% of athletes, and 14.1% had a recurrence of instability after surgery overall. Football had the highest rate of recurrence postoperatively at 23.8%. There was no difference in surgery rates between athletes with subluxations versus dislocations (P =.8458). Surgery was significantly more likely in those with frequent dislocations (P <.0001) and posterior instability (P =.027). There was a 10.7% recurrence rate overall with conservative treatment. Conclusion: Glenohumeral instability most commonly occurs in contact sports, affects male more than female patients, and is most frequently in the anterior direction. Recurrent instability is most common in football players. Attention should be turned to the specific characteristics of each type of instability to determine the best treatment for each athlete.","2019","2020-05-20 00:20:08","2020-05-20 00:20:08","","","","7","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2325967119861038; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628769876","adult; female; human; male; article; football; basketball; controlled study; major clinical study; cohort analysis; disease severity; cross-sectional study; prevalence; recurrent disease; recurrent shoulder dislocation; recurrence risk; health survey; wrestling; sporting event; shoulder injury; contact sport; postoperative care; clinical feature; conservative treatment; evidence based practice; shoulder dislocation; epidemiological data; glenohumeral instability; ICD-9; online analysis; shoulder arthritis; subluxation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This population experiences a substantial injury burden with many of these injuries affecting the upper extremities. The NCAA has adopted a data-driven decision-making process when providing recommendations for protecting player safety. The purpose of this study was to describe the epidemiology of hand and wrist injury in NCAA football in an effort to provide meaningful data for tailoring effective injury prevention strategies. Methods: An epidemiologic study utilizing the NCAA Injury Surveillance Program (NCAA-ISP) database was performed to investigate rates and patterns of hand and wrist injury in NCAA varsity football teams participating in the NCAA-ISP from 2009 to 2014. Descriptive statistics were used to present demographic data. Injury rates were calculated per 1000 athlete-exposures (AEs) using statistical cross-referencing between injury-level and event-level data. Injury mechanism and severity, as measured by time-loss from play, were determined and compared between exposure factors such as player position, player seniority, and practice versus game setting. Results: 725 hand and wrist injuries were captured in 899,225 AEs. The observed practice hand and wrist injury rate was 0.51 injuries per thousand AEs, which was significantly lower than the game injury rate of 3.60 (p < 0.01). Comparing player demographics for injuries sustained during practice as opposed to game time revealed significant differences based on player year, player position, activity performed at the time of injury, and mechanism of injury (p < 0.01, Figure 1). Player-on-player contact was the most common injury mechanism reported with blocking being the most common activity at injury. Of all sustained injuries, 71.4% resulted in no time loss from competition whereas 9.8% of injuries resulted in greater than 7 days of time loss. On average, fracture resulted in the greatest time loss from competition (8.3 ± 24.0 days for injuries sustained in practice setting, 7.7 ±15.8 days for injuries sustained in game setting). When comparing injury by location, hand injury resulted in greater time loss (3.7 ± 15.1, 4.4 ± 13.8) than to nail/subungual (0±0, 0±0), finger (1.6 ± 6.7, 1.1 ± 4.2), and wrist injury (1.2 ± 3.8, 1.8 ± 4.9). Conclusion: This study characterizes the incidence of NCAA football hand and wrist injuries in both practice and game settings and demonstrates the relatively low rate of injuries leading to loss of playing time. Hand and wrist injury was found to be significantly more common in games when compared to practice. Offensive linemen were the most commonly affected players in the cohort, with most injuries occurring during game time compared to practice. This study provides valuable prognostic data regarding expected time loss from play on a per injury pattern basis. Further investigation on specific injury subtypes and expected time loss as a result of these injures would provide trainers, players, and coaches with useful information on an expected post-injury recovery and rehabilitation timeline.

METHODS: Injury history from 16 football teams in the Swedish male first football league was evaluated during five consecutive seasons. The team's medical staff recorded team exposure and time-loss injuries prospectively between 2012 and 2016. RESULTS: In total, 467 time-loss injuries located in the hip/groin area were recorded among 1,687 professional male football players, with an overall incidence and burden of 0.82/1,000 h and 15.6/1,000 h, respectively. There appeared to be an increased risk of hip/groin injuries during the last two seasons (2015-2016); however, the difference was not statistically significant (n.s). Recurrent injury rate was relatively low (14%), and overuse injuries accounted for the majority of injuries and absence days. Muscle injuries were the main injury type, while kicking and sprinting/running were the primary causes of injury. Goalkeepers had the lowest percentage of injuries and absence days. CONCLUSION: Hip/groin injuries are a substantial problem in football, but does not seem to be an increasing phenomenon in the Swedish male first football league. Index and overuse injuries accounted for the majority of injuries and absence days. Thus, the focus should be on preventing hip/groin injuries to lower the injury rate.

The playing field is an extrinsic risk factor which has been poorly investigated in the literature. PURPOSE: The aim of our study was to define the incidence and risk factors of injuries in a cohort of footballers comparing the role of three different types of playing field (hard court, natural grass or synthetic grass). STUDY DESIGN: This was a cross sectional prevalence study. METHODS: The population comprised footballers recruited by a convenience sample; the instrument used for the survey was an anonymous self-administered questionnaire. RESULTS: 267 football players were enrolled (average age 23.4±4.8 years), of whom 33.7% (n=90/267) played on hard court, 33.0% (n=88/267) on natural grass and 33.3% (n=89/267) on synthetic grass. The overall incidence of injury was 40.1 (95% CI 34.1 to 46.8) ×1000 person-years of training, with higher values for ankle and knee injuries. Ankle injuries (aOR 0.4; P=0.021) were associated with playing on natural grass as a protective factor, while playing on natural grass seemed to be a risk factor for muscular injuries (aOR 2.3; P=0.026). CONCLUSION: Our study showed a high lifetime prevalence of injury among footballers (57%), in particular among athletes who play and train on a hard court. We have studied a topic poorly investigated previously and provide the opportunity to understand interventions to increase the capacity of stakeholders in preventing injuries.","2019","2020-05-20 00:20:15","2020-05-20 00:20:15","","501-506","","6","25","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/injuryprev-2018-042968; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629927111","adult; female; football player; human; male; article; controlled study; incidence; major clinical study; athlete; young adult; questionnaire; prevalence; knee injury; risk factor; muscle injury; disease burden; prevention; nonhuman; health education; ankle injury; grass; convenience sample; court; multiple trauma","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The development of sport on the Internet has led to the emergence of eSports and professionalization of virtual sports competitions. For some gamers playing computer games has turned into competition and later into the professionalization of the game. This paper explores the topic of electronic sports and virtual competition. It discusses eSports and the accompanying behaviors and practices. Authors delivered taxonomy of video game types, game modes and current phenomenon of both online and land-based tournaments as well eSports leagues. The paper also illustrates how gamers are preparing themselves for tournaments and a crucial role of gamers' motivation. Authors present the FIFA football games series and its eSports application. The adopted research method allowed to obtain answers from n=452 gamers. Results show that 60% of gamers have been spending more than 7 hours a week playing games. More than half of gamers have been playing for more than ten years. Most players play in games because it is considered as a hobby. Most of the gamers consider eSports as a sport. Most of the players are also spectators, who had watched in streaming at least one eSports tournament We find that FIFA game series has an extensive eSports platform and filled the gap by exploring it. Gamers usually play 40 games each weekend in FIFA eSports league but casual eSports gamers and spectators rarely take part in land-based tournaments.

Method: N = 10 panel experts participated in a three-step modified e-Delphi poll to generate consensus on a series of generic youth player attributes. A follow-up electronic survey completed by coaches, scouts and recruitment staff (n = 99) ranked these attributes to specific player-positions. Results: A final list of 44 player attributes found consensus using the three-step modified e-Delphi poll. Findings indicated that player-positional attributes considered most important in the youth phase are more psychological and technical than physiological or anthropometric. Despite 'hidden' attributes (e.g., coachability, flair, versatility, and vision) finding consensus on the e-Delphi poll, there was no evidence to support these traits when associated with a specific playing position. Conclusion: For those practitioners responsible for talent recruitment, our findings may provide greater understanding of the multiple attributes required for some playing positions. However, further ecological research is required to assess the veracity of our claims.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of the estimated age of first exposure to American tackle football participation on neurocognitive performance and symptom severity scores in collegiate student-athletes. METHODS: We used a cohort study in which neurocognitive performance was assessed using the Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing (ImPACT) test in 4376 male athletes (age 19.3 ± 1.5 years, mass 96.3 ± 20.3 kg, height 185.0 ± 7.4 cm). Athletes were grouped by sport participation [American football (n = 3462) or non-contact (n = 914)] and estimated age of first exposure [< 12 years (n = 3022) or ≥ 12 years (n = 1354)]. The outcome measures were the four primary cognitive scores and the symptom severity score from ImPACT. We assessed primary outcomes across groups, controlling for age, learning accommodations, and concussion history. RESULTS: Neurocognitive performance was not associated with the estimated age of first exposure-by-group interaction. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that participation in American tackle football before age 12 years does not result in neurocognitive deficits in college. Therefore, we suggest the following: the consequences of early exposure to repetitive head impacts do not manifest by college, the ImPACT test was not sensitive enough to identify the effects of an earlier estimated age of first exposure, or there is no association between an earlier estimated age of first exposure and neurocognitive functioning. Future longitudinal studies are warranted.","2019","2020-05-20 00:20:25","2020-05-20 00:20:25","","477-487","","3","49","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L626700569; http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40279-019-01069-x","adult; human; male; article; football; controlled study; major clinical study; athlete; cohort analysis; concussion; young adult; outcome assessment; height; learning; longitudinal study; cognitive defect; group dynamics; clinical assessment; head; college; student","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Background In collegiate football players, we reported no association between eAFE and baseline neurocognitive function. It is possible that neurocognitive deficits from earlier eAFE to American football, if present, are sufficiently compensated for in otherwise healthy individuals, but when faced with concussion, earlier eAFE may associate with longer symptom recovery, worse cognitive performance, or greater psychological distress. Design/Methods Participants were recruited as part of the NCAA-DoD Concussion Assessment, Research and Education (CARE) Consortium. There were 340 NCAA football players (age = 18.9 ± 1.4 years) who were evaluated 24-48 hours following concussion and had valid baseline data and 360 (age = 19.0 ± 1.3 years) who were evaluated at the time they were asymptomatic and had valid baseline data. Participants sustained a medically-diagnosed concussion between baseline testing and post-concussion assessments. Outcome measures included the number of days until asymptomatic, Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing (Im-PACT) composite scores, Brief Symptom Inventory 18 (BSI-18) subscores, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) scores. The eAFE was defined as the participant's age at the time of assessment minus the self-reported number of years playing football. Results Results of generalized linear modeling suggested that younger eAFE was only associated with lower (better) BSI-18 Somatization (estimate = 0.046, p = 0.046, CI = 0.001-0.091) and BSI-18 Anxiety sub-scores (estimate = 0.053, p = 0.039, CI = 0.003-0.104) at 24-48 hours. The eAFE was not associated with days until asymptomatic, ImPACT composite scores, HADS scores, or other BSI-18 sub-scores. Conclusions Earlier eAFE to football was not associated with longer symptom recovery, worse cognitive performance, or greater psychological distress following concussion. Longer duration of exposure to football during childhood and adolescence appears to be unrelated to clinical recovery following concussion.","2019","2020-05-20 00:20:27","2020-05-20 00:20:27","","S7","","14","93","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1212/01.wnl.0000580888.56349.3a; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629665599","adult; conference abstract; female; football player; human; male; clinical article; controlled study; concussion; young adult; child; cognitive defect; adolescence; anxiety; remission; education; childhood; mental stress; Brief Symptom Inventory; Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; somatization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Rugby sevens players experience accentuated loads during match-play, with mean total distances of ∼113- 120 m min-1 covered. Likewise, ∼30% of total match distances are covered at speeds ≥5 m s-1, while 39% more high velocity (≥4 m s-2) accelerations are performed when players compete in international tournaments. Accordingly, to facilitate optimised performance during match-play and realisation of training-induced adaptations, the energy balance of rugby sevens players needs consideration. However, limited data currently exists regarding the energy intake (EI) and expenditure (EE) of rugby sevens players in both training and competitive scenarios, especially in the case of female players. Therefore, this two-part study aimed to estimate EI and EE in international female rugby sevens players during a) a training camp (n = 11), and b) an international competition (n = 8) held within 14 days of each other. Tri-axial accelerometers (Actigraph wGT3X-BT, USA) and 5-day food diaries (quantifying portion sizes using household measures) facilitated estimation of EE and EI, respectively. Activity-based EE was combined with body mass-derived estimates of resting EE to estimate total daily EE (TDEE). Energy deficits of -47% (TDEETraining: 3502±400 kcal d-1, EITraining: 1859±221 kcal d-1, p≤0.001, d=5.1) and -50% (TDEECompetition: 3706±391 kcal d-1, EICompetition: 1857±243 kcal d-1,p≤0.001, d=5.7) were observed throughout training and competition. Similarly, CHO intakes were lower than sports nutrition recommendations in training (-62%; 2.3±0.3 g kg-1 BM-1, p≤0.001) and competitive (-60%; 2.4±0.5 g kg-1 BM-1, p≤0.001) scenarios whereas for protein (1.7±0.4g kg-1 BM-1, 1.5±0.1 g kg-1 BM-1) and fat (35±5%, 39±6% total energy) intakes exceeded the lower range of recommendations in both training and competition, respectively. In international female rugby sevens players, these findings indicate that estimated EE exceeds EI in both competition and training and that carbohydrate and fat intakes are less than optimal when compared to current performance-based sports nutrition recommendations.","2019","2020-05-20 00:20:28","2020-05-20 00:20:28","","2-3","","","29","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1123/ijsnem.2019-0057; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628159696","adult; conference abstract; female; human; rugby; case report; acceleration; clinical article; accelerometer; competition; caloric intake; carbohydrate; carbohydrate intake; fat intake; quantitative analysis; contact sport; energy balance; actigraph; household; portion size","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Healthy Māori, Pacific and European women (n=331; 16-45 years of age) completed an online Recent Physical Activity Questionnaire to assess recreational PA and adherence to PA guidelines. Existing PA preferences were tailored to make ethnic-specific suggestions aimed at increasing PA participation. RESULTS: Achievement of PA guidelines was: Māori 74%; Pacific 60%; European 70%. Highest participation across all women was for walking (Māori 72%, Pacific 60%, European 83%), followed by floor exercise (Māori 54%, Pacific 37%, European 56%). Gym-type activities (e.g. weights, aerobics) and jogging were also common across ethnic groups. Group/team activities (dance, netball, touch football) were among the top 10 activities for Māori and Pacific, but not European women. CONCLUSION: Obesity rates among specific ethnic groups of New Zealand women might be reduced by promoting activities that are: family/whānau-oriented (netball, touch), community-linked (hula, dance) and outdoor-based. Implications for public health: Tailoring existing PA preferences to develop ethnic-specific sets of activity suggestions could be important avenues to increase PA participation, improving the PA habits and subsequent health of New Zealand women and their communities.","2019","2020-05-20 00:20:35","2020-05-20 00:20:35","","443-450","","5","43","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1753-6405.12902; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L627864299","adult; female; human; Caucasian; exercise; adolescent; young adult; ethnic group; cross-sectional study; middle aged; New Zealand; lifestyle; cultural factor; ethnology; Oceanic ancestry group","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Possession Effectiveness Index, based on Expected Goals and Ball Movement Points metrics, was used to measure the effectiveness of team possessions. Linear mixed models were applied to analyse the influence of contextual variables on the effectiveness score for each style. Results showed that the effectiveness of Direct Play, Counterattack, Maintenance and Crossing significantly increased when teams were winning by two or more goals. Counterattack increased its effectiveness when teams were winning by one goal and reduced its effectiveness when losing by one goal. The effectiveness of Direct Play increased when losing by two goals or more. Playing away negatively affected the effectiveness of Direct Play, Maintenance and High Pressure. In addition, playing against a stronger opposition reduced the effectiveness of all styles of play. The results suggest that the effectiveness of styles of play changes under specific circumstances and that not all contextual variables affect them in the same way.

To better understand the effects of repetitive subconcussive impacts, the biomechanics of on-field head impacts and resulting brain deformation need to be well characterized. The current study evaluates local brain response to typical youth football head impacts using the atlas-based brain model (ABM), an anatomically accurate brain finite element (FE) model. Head impact kinematic data were collected from three local youth football teams using the Head Impact Telemetry (HIT) System. The azimuth and elevation angles were used to identify impacts near six locations of interest, and low, moderate, and high acceleration magnitudes (5th, 50th, and 95th percentiles, respectively) were calculated from the grouped impacts for FE simulation. Strain response in the brain was evaluated by examining the range and peak maximum principal strain (MPS) values in each element. A total of 40,538 impacts from 119 individual athletes were analyzed. Impacts to the facemask resulted in 0.18 MPS for the high magnitude impact category. This was 1.5 times greater than the oblique impact location, which resulted in the lowest strain value of 0.12 for high magnitude impacts. Overall, higher strains resulted from a 95th percentile lateral impact (41.0g, 2556 rad/sec2) with two predominant axes of rotation than from a 95th percentile frontal impact (67.6g, 2641 rad/sec2) with a single predominant axis of rotation. These findings highlight the importance of accounting for directional dependence and relative contribution of axes of rotation when evaluating head impact response.","2019","2020-05-20 00:20:42","2020-05-20 00:20:42","","1561-1570","","10","36","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2018.6037; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L627647013","human; article; football; acceleration; biomechanics; controlled study; adolescent; athlete; child; school child; simulation; kinematics; brain function; frontal lobe; telemetry; finite element analysis; accuracy; analytical equipment; biological model; head impact; mathematical computing; mechanical stress; medical parameters; neuroanatomy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is a single mechanism of propulsion and amortisation. Sports people, football players in particular, are especially prone to limb loading. In this discipline, the first contact with the sport as well as training begin at a very young age. In order to prevent traumas and injuries among young players, it is important to assess their foot arch. Material and methods: A group of 30 players aged 13-18 who played football at the Progres Sports Academy in Cracow and at the lower- and upper-secondary schools in Cracow under the patronage of Marcin Gortat were tested. The tests involved the podoscopic evaluation of both feet, the test of both feet on a tensometric mat and a survey. To assess the longitudinal foot arch, Clarke's angle was applied in the authors' own tests. The transverse arch was evaluated using the Wejsflog index. Results: For the overwhelming majority of the persons tested, the most common type of longitudinal arch was flat foot. Only a scant minority had a tendency towards hollow foot. The most common injuries among the examined footballers included muscle pulling and tearing as well as sprains and overloading. Most players suffered injuries of thigh muscles, knee joints, tarsal joints and feet. Conclusions: It was confirmed that there was a significant correlation between the intensity of training and the frequency of injuries.","2019","2020-05-20 00:20:44","2020-05-20 00:20:44","","13-18","","4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","","","","https://gateway.library.qut.edu.au/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=c8h&AN=141060068&site=ehost-live&scope=site","Male; Data Analysis Software; Human; Descriptive Statistics; Questionnaires; Adolescence; Sports Organizations; Poland; Exercise Intensity; Schools, Secondary; Chi Square Test; Athletes, Male -- In Adolescence; Athletic Training; Biomechanics -- Evaluation; Body Weights and Measures -- Methods; Correlational Studies; Fisher's Exact Test; Flatfoot; Foot -- Anatomy and Histology; Foot Injuries; Football Injuries -- Etiology; Football Injuries -- Prevention and Control; Football Injuries -- Risk Factors; Knee Joint; Muscle, Skeletal -- Injuries; Sprains and Strains; Tarsal Joint; Thigh; Yates' Continuity Correction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, the objective of this study was to compare head impact exposure (HIE) measured in game plays among 3 youth football teams. METHODS Head impact and video data were collected from athletes (ages 10–13 years) participating on 3 youth football teams. Video analysis was performed to verify head impacts and assign each to a specific play type. Each play was categorized as a down, punt, kickoff, field goal, or false start. Kickoffs and punts were classified as special teams. Downs were classified as running, passing, or other. HIE was quantified by play type in terms of mean, median, and 95th percentile linear and rotational acceleration. Mixed-effects models were used to assess differences in acceleration among play types. Contact occurring on special teams plays was evaluated using a standardized video abstraction form. RESULTS A total of 3003 head impacts over 27.5 games were analyzed and paired with detailed video coding of plays. Most head impacts were attributed to running (79.6%), followed by passing (14.0%), and special teams (6.4%) plays. The 95th percentile linear acceleration measured during each play type was 52.6g, 50.7g, and 65.5g, respectively. Special teams had significantly greater mean linear acceleration than running and passing plays (both p = 0.03). The most common kick result on special teams was a deep kick, of which 85% were attempted to be returned. No special teams plays resulted in a touchback, and one resulted in a fair catch. One-third of all special teams plays and 92% of all nonreturned kicks resulted in athletes diving toward the ball. CONCLUSIONS The results demonstrate a trend toward higher head impact magnitudes on special teams than for running and passing plays, but a greater number of impacts were measured during running plays. Deep kicks were most common on special teams, and many returned and nonreturned kicks resulted in athletes diving toward the ball. These results support policy changes to youth special teams plays, including modifying the yard line the ball is kicked from and coaching proper return technique. Further investigation into biomechanical exposure measured during game impact scenarios is needed to inform policy relevant to the youth level.","2019","2020-05-20 00:20:45","2020-05-20 00:20:45","","190-199","","2","24","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.3171/2019.2.PEDS18558; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002453011","football player; human; article; football; acceleration; priority journal; athlete; concussion; running; child; videorecording; head impact exposure; interrater reliability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A study of the motives of highly skilled athletes of the Italian national team in futsal 5 × 5 (B1) (sports of the blind) was conducted. Motives presented in the questionnaire can be grouped according to the attitude of the athlete to himself, goals (level of claims), his team and the people around him. Highly qualified Italian footballers were highly appreciated, and their unanimity was statistically confirmed that the motives that characterize the level of an athlete's pretensions are most significant (being able to join the national team and represent their country in international competitions; it's nice to experience the joy of victory; Europe, the world and the Paralympic Games; the high prestige of victories in major competitions) and the athlete's awareness of himself as part of a team in achieving overall success (nice feel a sense of accomplishment before teammates, like the process of sports training and its components: training, training, friendly games, test competitions, it is nice when the coach praises and approves). At the same time, respondents rated low motives directly related to the athlete and the attitude of the people around him. It became clear that the definition of the main motives and peculiarities of the sports motivation of players in mini-football 5 × 5 (B1) (sports of the blind) will make it possible to more effectively reveal the potential of each athlete and increase the stability of his results. The underestimation of the value of motivation of athletes to trainings by coaches always leads to a distortion of the expected results during the sports training of the football team of blind athletes.","2019","2020-05-20 00:20:47","2020-05-20 00:20:47","","482-492","","1","10","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L627374648","football player; human; article; football; soccer; scoring system; training; competition; athlete; questionnaire; endurance; emotion; skill; motivation; mental stress; 10 point scale; assessment of humans; patience","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In US Major League Baseball, the experience of the Oakland Athletics' general manager in the last decade turned his ""Moneyball"" model into a synonym of quantitative analysis in the transfer market of baseball players. His strategy focused on hiring players with outstanding technical skills but relatively low market value. This study adapted this model to the framework of a multiple criteria decision aid (MCDA), by selecting undervalued players who have complementary abilities. The novelty here refers to the joint use of four algorithms explored by the composition of probabilistic preferences (CPP) (i.e., ranking, classification, dynamic evaluation and regularity analysis) and their application to soccer player performance evaluation. The new model analysed the recent transfer of a left-back soccer player to Europe. The results indicated 12 opportunities for better investment, among 32 left and right-back players considered. Two years later, the value of the same player was considerably lower. He played only five matches in the 2018-2019 season, without scoring or providing any assists. On the other hand, the players better classified by the CPP-MB model presented higher performances and market values.","2019","2020-05-20 00:20:50","2020-05-20 00:20:50","","1-27","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02640414.2019.1702280; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L630427479","human; male; article; soccer player; season; Europe; algorithm; investment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Noise is one of the leading causes for hearing loss. Being exposed to noises above 70 dBA, is accepted as a risk factor for hearing loss. The duration of the noise as well its intensity are two determinants for the type and level of hearing loss. Football referees can be under the risk of hearing loss, because the endure very high levels of noise (supporter noise, band noise, etc.) during a 90-minute match. The temporary threshold shifts (TTS) that are caused by these noises can lead to permanent threshold shifts (PTS). Methods. The hearing status of the football referees was evaluated with a short questionnaire consisting of 27 questions. The results of the survey of the 26-person group of chief and assistant referees were compared and their exposure to noise was questioned. The aim of this study is to evaluate the hearing health of the football referees who are thought to be at risk. Thus, it is aimed to take various measures to protect their hearing health and to prevent deterioration of their hearing. Results. According to the results of these surveys, it was found that these referees did not generally have hearing complaints, but the complaints of tinnitus were more prominent (25%). It was observed that their understanding of speech was not very good especially in noisy environments (29.7%). There was no significant difference between the chief referees and the assistant referees (p> 0.05). Discussions. There was no significant difference between these two groups of referees in terms of all questions. The reason for this is thought to be while the chief referees are close to the whistle sound, the assistant referees are close to the supporters and the sounds the make. In addition, due to the fact that the age of referees was young and the years of them being referees were not very long, it was understood that hearing loss, ringing and noise comprehension skills were close to normal values, although they were not at normal levels.

Compared to the other components of the respiratory system, training does not result into significant improvements as for the increase of the expiratory flow. The assessment of the respiratory function may indicate certain disorders of the bronchi and of the lungs, but, on the other hand, it offers little information on the aerobic capacity of the individuals or the effects of physical exercises. Aim: The purpose of this research was to study the respiratory volumes in two football teams that are part of two different leagues (2nd league, and 5th league, respectively), and to compare these results with the ones at the international level. Materials and methods: We included in this research two football teams in two different leagues (2nd league, and 5th league, respectively) and, from each team, we chose the players with the highest number of minutes spent playing throughout the championship return phase. In order to perform spirometry, we used a portable spirometer (Spirotube Spirometer, PC Spirometer). The prediction method used by the spirometer software was the one presented by the European Respiratory Society and Kudson. Results: By comparing the environments of the two groups we can see that, in terms of height and weight, the two samples present close values. According to the results recorded with the help of the spirometer, the value of the forced vital capacity (FVC = 4.50) represents 98% of the normal level, and the Expiratory volume per second FEV1 (FEV1 = 4.50) represents 97% of the normal level. Within the ASU group, the value of the forced vital capacity (FVC = 5.19) represents 95% of the normal level, and the Expiratory volume per second (FEV1 = 4.45) represents 95% of the normal level. As we can see, neither of the groups reaches the normal potential. However, the CS UVT group reaches a higher percentage than the other, although they play their matches in a lower league. Conclusions: Considering that we could not compare the types of training that the two teams had during the preparation phase, we cannot say whether such trainings had a certain effect on the subjects. Further research should be carried out in order to determine if the type of training had a beneficial effect in the case of the CS UVT group.

Also, to evaluate the effects on visual-motor reaction time (VMRT) and effectiveness of response (ER). A system of analysis, evaluation and specific training was applied, followed by comparison using different tests to assess the players' performance. We evaluated 8 male rugby seven players from the Chilean national team (age: 28.5 ± 2.2 years, height: 179.5 ± 6.5 cm, weight: 92.5 ± 7.8 kg). The results showed that in the two variables, the players show statistically significant average improvements in the RTs of the total actions (total VMRT: 5.1%, 95%CI: 17.3–69.24, p=0.006, ES: 0.49) and in the RTs of attempts that were considered effective (effectiveVMRT: 9.3%, 95%CI: 22.77–77.08, p=0.003, ES: 0.66). In the case of ER, a slight improvement in the quality of the actions is detected (4.1% increase in effectiveness and 4.3% decrease in failed attempts), although the changes are not statistically significant. In conclusion, it can be stated that the neurocognitive training programme used led to an improvement in the performance of the variables VMRT and ER, with a differing degree of effectiveness.

A retrospective analysis combining counts of experienced HAEs and longitudinal diffusion-weighted imaging explored whether greater exposure to incident mechanical forces was associated with traditional diffusion-based measures of neural injury—reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) and increased mean diffusivity (MD). Brains of high school athletes (N = 61) participating in American football exhibited greater spatial extents (or volumes) experiencing substantial changes (increases and decreases) in both FA and MD than brains of peers who do not participate in collision-based sports (N = 15). Further, the spatial extents of the football athlete brain exhibiting traditional diffusion-based markers of neural injury were found to be significantly correlated with the cumulative exposure to HAEs having peak translational acceleration exceeding 20 g. This finding demonstrates that subconcussive HAEs induce low-level neurotrauma, with prolonged exposure producing greater accumulation of neural damage. The duration and extent of recovery associated with periods in which athletes do not experience subconcussive HAEs now represents a priority for future study, such that appropriate participation and training schedules may be developed to minimize the risk of long-term neurological dysfunction.","2019","2020-05-20 00:20:58","2020-05-20 00:20:58","","","","","24","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nicl.2019.101930; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2003394364","adult; football player; human; male; article; priority journal; adolescent; follow up; retrospective study; longitudinal study; white matter; high school student; nervous system injury; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; diffusion weighted imaging; diffusivity; fractional anisotropy; head acceleration event; head movement; signa hdxt","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Football coaches for the program, called Auskick, completed an online survey providing qualitative and quantitative information about their experiences of inclusive coaching. Coaches (N = 130) completed the survey over 2016/2017. The average years of coaching experience was 3.3 (range 0–19 years). While 79% of coaches had experienced a child with a disability attending their football centre, only 31% of coaches (56% of paid coaches and 27% of volunteer coaches) had completed disability training. Autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and intellectual disability were the most common types of developmental disabilities, and asthma, vision and hearing problems were the most common physical disabilities of children attending the coaches' centres. Eighty-nine coaches provided examples of inclusive approaches. The most common was having an inclusive attitude, asking the parents for help, making adaptations to suit the child, giving extra time, getting additional help and staff training. Community football coaches frequently work with children who have a broad range of developmental and physical disabilities. Coach disability training is needed to support children with disabilities attending these types of sporting programs in the community.

Therefore, objective of the study was to detect new biomarkers in plasma, saliva and urine in response to acute muscle damage induced by physical exercise. A cross-sectional study was conducted with 27 American football players. Before the physical exercises (T0), 60 minutes (T1) and 24 hours (T2) after physical exercise, was determined the clinical, biochemical and molecular parameters, including ADA, TBARS, leukocytes, lymphocytes and comet assay. The serum ADA was significantly higher in T1 and T2, in the urine there was a significant increase in T1, in the saliva there was no significant differences. There was an increase in serum TBARS in T2, saliva and urine in T1. The leukocytes increased in T1 and decreased in T2. Through the comet assay was observed significant DNA damage in T1 and T2. Serum and urinary ADA activity, serum, urinary and salivary TBARS are robust and promising biomarkers of acute muscle injury and that the comet assay allows a quick and effective evaluation of DNA lesions induced by physical exercise and could be used to monitor athletes avoiding injuries that are more serious.","2019","2020-05-20 00:21:04","2020-05-20 00:21:04","","","","","55","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002896028; http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/s2175-97902019000117594","adult; human; male; article; clinical article; exercise; physical activity; training; athlete; young adult; cross-sectional study; spectrophotometry; muscle injury; diastolic blood pressure; systolic blood pressure; biological marker; saliva analysis; adenosine deaminase; comet assay; leukocyte; sphygmomanometry; thiobarbituric acid reactive substance; urinalysis; vein puncture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

RAE was also analyzed within each age group of players (U8 to U19) and within each team category considering the sport expertise level (A, B, C and D teams), according to the kind of club. All players (n = 1862) belonged to eight Spanish football clubs and 114 teams. Birth dates were categorized into relative age quartiles. The results obtained by the square test revealed the existence of a RAE with a large effect in the Elite group, while in the lower-level group this effect was medium. Thus, results show significant differences in the Elite group in all age categories, whilst in the lower-level group these were only observed in the U14, U16 and U18 categories. With respect to the team category, while RAE was observed in the Elite group in all teams, in the lower-level group it was only observed in teams A and B. In conclusion, RAE is more pronounced in Elite clubs, even starting at the U8 category. However, in lower-level clubs, where the objective is not just performance, it is delayed. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR El propósito de este estudio fue identificar la existencia del Efecto de la Edad Relativa (EER) en el fútbol base en clubes de elite y clubes con un nivel inferior en España. El EER también fue analizado dentro de cada categoría federativa o grupo de edad (Sub-8 a Sub-19) y dentro de cada categoría de equipo teniendo en cuenta el nivel de experiencia deportiva (equipos A, B, C y D), de acuerdo con el tipo de club. Todos los jugadores (n = 1862) pertenecían a ocho clubes de fútbol españoles y 114 equipos. Las fechas de nacimiento se categorizaron en cuartiles. Los resultados obtenidos con la prueba de Chi-cuadrado revelaron la existencia de un EER de gran tamaño en el grupo Elite, mientras que en el grupo de nivel inferior este efecto fue medio. Además, los resultados muestran diferencias significativas en el grupo Elite en todas las categorías de edad, mientras que en el grupo de nivel inferior solo se observaron en las categorías Sub-14, Sub-16 y Sub-18. Con respecto a la categoría de equipo, mientras que el efecto se observó en el grupo Elite en todos los equipos, en el grupo de nivel inferior solo se observó en los equipos A y B. Como conclusión, el EER es más pronunciado en los clubes Elite, incluso comenzando en la categoría Sub-8. Sin embargo, en los clubes de nivel inferior, donde el objetivo no es solo el rendimiento, se retrasa.

This paper explores match official perceptions of support and abuse in rugby union and cricket in England. Match officials in rugby union and cricket operating at all levels of their sports were surveyed. In total 1228 surveys were completed, presenting a real-life representation of experiences. Results revealed that 49% of rugby union and 45% of cricket match officials experienced abuse at least twice every season, and 51% of rugby union and 47% of cricket match officials believed that abuse had increased, whilst concerns with the training and support provided were identified. Therefore, there is a requirement for the management/support structures assisting match officials to be re-evaluated. As the first empirical paper on abuse and support of match officials in rugby union and cricket, this research advances our understanding about the challenges faced in these sports.

It is currently unknown whether college football linemen display a similar risk profile. OBJECTIVE: (1) To determine for the first time whether college football linemen show risk for SDB and (2) test the hypothesis that SDB risk is higher in college football linemen compared with an athletic comparison group. DESIGN: Descriptive laboratory study. SETTING: The Health Risk Assessment Laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: Male football linemen (n = 21) and track (n = 19) Division I athletes between the ages of 18 and 22 years. INTERVENTIONS: Participants completed the Multivariable Apnea Prediction Index and Epworth Sleepiness Scale surveys, validated measures of symptoms of sleep apnea and daytime sleepiness, respectively. Neck and waist circumferences, blood pressure, Modified Mallampati Index (MMPI), and tonsil size were determined, followed by body composition assessment using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Scores from surveys, anthropometric data, MMPI, and body composition. RESULTS: Survey data demonstrated a deficiency in sleep quality and efficiency, coinciding with increased self-reported symptoms of apnea (Multivariable Apnea Prediction Index = 0.78) in college linemen relative to track athletes. Neck circumference (44.36 cm), waist circumference (107.07 cm), body mass index (35.87 kg/m2), and percent body fat (29.20%), all of which exceeded the clinical predictors of risk for obstructive sleep apnea, were significantly greater in linemen compared with track athletes. Multivariable Apnea Prediction variables were significantly correlated with MMPI, neck circumference, percent body fat, body mass index, and systolic blood pressure (r ≥ .31, P < .05), indicating that college football linemen are at increased risk for SDB. CONCLUSIONS: Risk factors for SDB recognized in professional football linemen are also present at the college level. Screening may minimize present or future risk for SDB, as well as the downstream risk of SDB-associated metabolic and cardiovascular disease.","2019","2020-05-20 00:21:09","2020-05-20 00:21:09","","126-132","","2","28","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1123/jsr.2017-0127; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L626102465","human; male; football; adolescent; athlete; body mass; young adult; risk assessment; physiology; blood pressure; anthropometry; body composition; photon absorptiometry; university; sleep disordered breathing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As such, the purpose of this study was to investigate event experience perspectives among attendee segments at Football Championship Subdivision (FCS) games. Data were collected by self-administering surveys on-site during home games played at a public FCS Division I institution in the southeastern region of the United States. Distinguishable characteristics were explored between students, season ticket holders, and single-game purchasers by conducting Multi-group Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). SEM was used to test causal relationships among eight sportscape factors (i.e., facility design, facility maintenance, game/stadium atmosphere, crowd energy, staff, facility access, player performance, and self-service technology), and attendees' assessment of event quality and institutional brand equity. The model comparison between single game attendees, season ticket holders, and students rendered significant differences. It is evident that perceptions of event quality plays a more pronounced role in cultivating brand equity among those who do not possess partiality towards the institution and its football team (i.e., single-game attendees versus season ticket holders/students). Findings also indicated that the pervasive factor explaining event quality, regardless of spectator type, was the game's atmosphere.

Subjects were categorized into 3 different groups based on their total number of interscholastic career headers: low (< 100), moderate (100−199), and high (200+). Baseline and subsequent post-season neurocognitive performance measures utilizing the Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics (ANAM) software were derived on all players along with a monitoring of concussion-related symptoms. Data were analyzed using a series of two-level growth curves. While there were a few subtle decreases in performance throughout the testing period, no significant differences in test scores occurred during the interscholastic careers of these female football players. While we hypothesized that differences in cognitive performance would degrade over the playing career, especially in the high header group, our results prove otherwise adding to the existing body of evidence recognizing no changes with these variables in other cohorts of football players.

Methods: Cross-sectional cohort study observing 63 youth football players, varying in position. Independent variables were league (weight-restricted (WR, n = 27) and age-restricted (AR, n = 36) and event type. Dependent variables were anthropometrics, work-to-rest ratio, and wet bulb globe temperature. Descriptive variables included preparticipation examination and uniform configuration. A subset of 16 players participated in physiological variables (heart rate and gastrointestinal temperature). Data collection occurred on 7 AR and 8 WR nonconsecutive practices and the first 3 games of the season. Results: Mean values for anthropometric variables were higher (p < 0.05) in the AR league than the WR league. Work time (χ2 (1,111) = 4.232; p = 0.039) and rest time (χ2 (1,111) = 43.41; p < 0.001) were significantly greater for games, but ratios were significantly higher for practices (χ2 (1,111) = 40.62; p < 0.001). The majority of events (77%) observed were in black and red flag wet bulb globe temperature risk categories. A total of 57% of the players had a preparticipation examination, and up to 82% of events observed were in full uniforms. Individual gastrointestinal temperature and heart rate responses ranged widely and no players reached critical thresholds. Conclusion: Extrinsic (disproportionate work ratios, environmental conditions) and intrinsic (higher body mass index) EHI risk factors exist in youth football. Certain risk factors may be influenced by event and league type. National youth football organizations need to create thorough guidelines that address EHI risk factors for local leagues to adopt.","2019","2020-05-20 00:21:20","2020-05-20 00:21:20","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jshs.2019.03.002; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002142938","football player; human; article; heart rate; season; body mass; cohort analysis; juvenile; dependent variable; risk factor; anthropometry; practice guideline; rest; organization; core temperature; heat exchange; heat injury; independent variable","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Semistructured interviews took place with 17 older adults playing walking football for 6 months minimum (Mage = 64). Inductive analysis revealed six higher order themes representing preinitiation influences. Eight further higher order themes were found, relating to positive and negative experiences during initiation. Fundamental influences preinitiation included previous sporting experiences and values and perceptions. Emergent positive experiences during initiation included mental development and social connections. Findings highlight important individual and social influences when initiating walking football, which should be considered when encouraging 55- to 75-year-old adults to play adapted sport.

We attempt to explain this phenomenon by focusing on two analytical dimensions. First, we ask to what extent are political elements in fans' antagonistic communication guided by politics, in the narrower sense, that is, political ideology, party affiliation, historical narratives, etc.—the political–historical dimension. Second, we ask to what extent are these political elements means of performance in an intense game of identity reaffirmation—the game dimension. We address these questions qualitatively, using data from 20 field observations of first division football games and from 38 in-depth interviews, predominantly with football fans. We conclude that both dimensions are meaningful and useful in explaining football fans' antagonistic communication.

Physical exertion was expected to be a stressor that would evoke different ways of coping with a subsequent choice reaction task. The data were collected in a regularly held comprehensive assessment center. The explanatory power of this measurement was examined in terms of playing position effects and prognostic validity. Additionally, adolescent's variability in reaction performance was investigated regarding success at senior level. Methods: Multiple choice reaction performance was recorded prior to and immediately after an incremental exhaustive treadmill-running test. Results: Choice reaction performance discriminated between playing positions but failed to be an early predictor of future playing success. In comparison to not drafted players, senior female national team soccer players showed comparable fluctuations and no superiority during adolescence. Conclusions: The position-specific effects are discussed in the view of the cognitive skills approach. It is concluded that choice reaction performance is more useful for identifying factors that hinder or support the developing soccer player, than as a tool for eliminating players in the selection process.","2019","2020-05-20 00:21:30","2020-05-20 00:21:30","","593-602","","9","178","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2004014631; http://dx.doi.org/10.23736/S0393-3660.18.03930-X","female; human; human experiment; male; article; soccer player; controlled study; adolescent; juvenile; validity; endurance; reaction time; adolescence; treadmill exercise; psychomotor performance; position effect","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Participants included 98 male soccer athletes (aged 14-15) from 10 middle schools of Jiangsu province, China. Data analysis included descriptive statistics and a 2 (Supporting: By Parents or By School) x 2 (Goal-Setting: For Professional or For Non-Professional) MANOVA. The top three scores from the 18 motivation factors (MFs) in the AQSAMHRB included MF1, high technical content and unique value, M = 4.73; MF4, to meet friends, M = 4.42; and MF2, for fun, M = 4.34. The 2 x 2 MANOVA revealed no significant difference in Supporting, p > .32, Λ = .79, F = 1.16, but a significant difference in Goal-Setting, p < .00, Λ = .03, F = 143.61. The follow-up MANOVA discovered that 12 of the 18 MF comparisons in Goal-Setting showed significant difference at p < .05, with For Professional scoring higher than For Non-Professional (e.g., MF6, to contest winners; MF7, to shape the body; MF9, to become a professional; and MF17, to become a coach). In brief, intrinsic and extrinsic MFs significantly affected these soccer athletes' motivations. It did not matter who supported their participation, but it was their Goal-Setting on becoming a Professional or Non-Professional athlete that mattered. On the other hand, for the 27 health-related behaviors in the AQSAMHRB, frequency and percentage data were analyzed and summarized. Findings from this aspect provide firsthand information about the youth soccer athletes' eating habits, nutrition knowledge and status, risk behaviors, and hygiene behaviors. A meaningful discussion from an educational perspective has also been provided.

Seven hundred and twenty matches from season 2014 to 2016 of CSL were analysed and all teams were classified into two groups according to their final rankings at the end of each season. The game-related statistics were divided into goal scored, offensive, defensive, and physical variables. Mann–Whitney U-test with effect size at 95% of confidence interval, and Discriminant analyses were used. Results showed a home advantage (HA) near 60%. In addition, home teams showed significantly higher average values in performance indicators regardless of the team's quality, especially in goal (score: 1.55 vs. 1.22; ES = 0.27 ± 0.10, and shots: 13.29 vs. 11.01; ES = 0.47 ± 0.10) and offence variables (possession: 0.51 vs. 0.49; ES = 0.33 ± 0.10). According to quality of opposition, superior teams played better at home in attacking categories like goal scored (1.83 vs. 1.39; ES = 0.34 ± 0.15) and offensive (possession: 0.53 vs. 0.51; ES = 0.33 ± 0.14).

However, the literature has reported that athletes show better driving ability than nonathletes. This paradox between behaviors and abilities motivated the present study to further understand the collision risk of varsity athletes. Objective: The current study estimates the performance differences between varsity male soccer players and male undergraduate nonathletes on (1) a driving task and (2) three perceptual-cognitive tasks (associated with collision risk prediction; i.e., Useful Field of View [UFOV] test). Methods: Thirty-five male undergraduate students (15 varsity soccer players, 20 undergraduate nonathletes) took part in this study. Driving performance was assessed during 14 min of urban commuting using a driving simulator. While completing the simulated driving task and UFOV test, the physiological responses were monitored using an electrocardiograph (ECG) to document heart rate variability (HRV). Results: Varsity soccer players showed more risky behaviors at the wheel compared to their nonathlete student peers. Varsity soccer players spent more time over the speed limit, committed more driving errors, and adopted fewer safe and legal behaviors. However, no difference was observed between both groups on driving skill variables (i.e., vehicle control, vehicle mobility, ecodriving). For subtests 1 and 2 of the UFOV (i.e., processing speed, divided attention), both groups performed identically (i.e., 17 ms). The nonathlete group tended to perform better on the selective attention task (i.e., subtest 3 of UFOV test; 63.2 ± 6.2 ms vs. 87.2 ± 10.7 ms, respectively; this difference was not significant, P = .76). Conclusion: Preventive driving measures should be enforced in this high-risk population to develop strategies for risk reduction in male team athletes.","2019","2020-05-20 00:21:36","2020-05-20 00:21:36","","528-533","","5","20","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","","","","https://gateway.library.qut.edu.au/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=c8h&AN=137091690&site=ehost-live&scope=site","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The research design utilised semi-structured interviews and a survey instrument. A total of 12 participants comprised of 11 active head recruiters representing 11 Australian Football League Clubs, and one former expert Australian Football League recruiter undertook semi-structured, in-depth interviews to provide insight into recruitment decision making. Additionally, all participants completed a survey determining preferences for intuitive and deliberative decision-making styles. A model created represents the identification of four influential factors in the recruitment approach including (a) recruiter background; (b) recruiter attributes; (c) recruiter understanding of team needs and (d) recruiter–coach relationship. In particular, recruiters revealed that the style of decision making they use is influenced by the relationship with the head coach. Recruiting as a stand-alone position is not well understood. This work shows that both intuition and deliberation are used, the extent to which appears to be influenced by the recruiter–coach relationship. This work offers a strong base to further explore recruiting and talent identification in professional sport, and, particularly, how relationships influence decision style and performance.

One-hundred and fifty-eight junior elite soccer players (mean age: 17.07±0.79 years; mean height: 177.85±6.64 cm; mean weight: 71.27±7.96 kg; mean body-mass index: 22.50±1.66 kg/m²) were randomly selected into two groups: (1) exponential and (2) linear tapering group. Training sessions were conducted three times a week for eight weeks. Aft er four and eight weeks of the tapering period, participants were measured in the distance covered according to four basic playing positions on the field: (1) goalkeepers, (2) defenders, (3) midfielders, and (4) forwards. The results showed that the largest effects between the pre- and post-measurement had defenders in the exponential and goalkeepers in the linear group, goalkeepers in the distance covered by slow and medium running in both groups, forwards in fast running and sprinting in the exponential group, and midfielders in the linear group. In conclusion, our results suggest that the exponential tapering protocol brought somewhat larger effects, especially in fast running and sprinting in forwards and slow and medium running in goalkeepers. Future studies need to implement both the exponential and the linear tapering protocols in order to enhance performance but favouring the exponential to produce larger effects.

This study will assess the associations between a history of repetitive low-level head trauma and general and neurological health in retired professional footballers aged 50+in England. The main exposure measures are concussions and cumulative lifetime repeated sub-concussive head impacts (RSHIs), either from heading footballs or other forces applied to the head. Information on factors associated with concussions and RSHIs will be collected via a structured questionnaire during face-to-face interviews. Our approach will include: a. Literature search to identify potentially important proxy measures of RSHI during training and matches; b. Developing a model of cumulative RSHIs, based on the more strongly predictive variables, which may include playing position, the frequency of heading, the number of games played and training sessions attended, decade of play and the type of ball used. c. The model will be developed from analyses of head contacts from video footage of matches and training, at the individual level and in general, and from statistics on playing career. We will also consult a panel of former professional footballers on the exposure assessment. The exposure data will be crucial to assess whether those with higher exposure within the study cohort are at increased risk compared to those with lower exposure.","2019","2020-05-20 00:21:44","2020-05-20 00:21:44","","A59","","","76","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/OEM-2019-EPI.159; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628118863","conference abstract; football player; human; controlled study; cohort analysis; concussion; risk assessment; head injury; cognitive defect; statistics; career; videorecording; interview; degenerative disease; structured questionnaire; England; nervous system","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The current study sought to quantify exposure to gambling and alcohol marketing, and responsible gambling messages within matchday programmes. Programmes for each team in the English Premier League and Championship were analysed across consecutive matchday weekends, made available to 1,269,404 match-going fans. Direct adverts for, and incidental exposure to, gambling, alcohol, and responsible gambling marketing or messages were coded. Direct adverts were counted, as were absolute counts and percentage of pages with incidental exposure. Programmes averaged 2.3 direct gambling adverts and 37.8 instances of incidental gambling marketing exposure. Incidental gambling marketing was found on 22.2% of pages. There was more gambling marketing than either alcohol marketing or responsible gambling messages. This was observed across: number of direct adverts (p < .001), incidents of exposure (p < .001) and the percentage of pages with exposure (p < .001). Teams with gambling shirt sponsors had more incidental marketing exposure, in both absolute count (p < .001) and percentage of pages (p < .001) but did not have more direct gambling adverts (p = .63). Incidental exposure to gambling marketing was present in 59.0% of children's specific sections of programmes. There was greater exposure to gambling marketing in soccer matchday programmes. Gambling marketing was frequently evident in child specific sections of matchday programmes. Attending soccer matches and reading the matchday programme increases exposure to gambling.","2019","2020-05-20 00:21:47","2020-05-20 00:21:47","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629893960; http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10899-019-09912-6","human; article; soccer; controlled study; child; advertising; alcohol; marketing; pathological gambling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

TBI can be one of the major risk factors for development of cognitive impairment, dementia and trigger other neurodegenerative conditions, such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy. The harmful consequence of repetitive mild TBI has been described in the brains of contact sport players who suffered by repeated concussive head impacts. Due to missing immediate visible symptoms the currently used techniques have limited abilities to identify mTBI. Therefore, there is a need for a simple and reliable biofluid-based diagnostic test for TBI patients. In our study we used digital-ELISA to perform analysis of protein biomarkers (neurofilament light chain and tau protein) in blood serum of the athletes. The results indicated altered dynamics of protein markers following high intensity exercise, heading and concussion. Based on these results, expression analyses for microRNAs (miRNAs) were performed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Specific miRNAs have been previously reported as dysregulated after TBI conditions and therefore miRNAs could possibly represent a potential peripheral biomarker. Our results showed changed levels of different miRNAs depending on time of serum collection and study group. The main aim of our project is to identify a potential molecular marker for more precise diagnostics and follow up of symptoms after TBI.","2019","2020-05-20 00:21:49","2020-05-20 00:21:49","","45","","","49","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/eji.201970500; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L631605630","adult; conference abstract; human; soccer player; exercise; controlled study; concussion; follow up; human tissue; traumatic brain injury; biological marker; endogenous compound; diagnosis; gene expression; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; microRNA; light chain; molecular marker; neurofilament; real time polymerase chain reaction; serum","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet, how the derived external load variables relate to fatigue and recovery post-training or post-match is scarcely researched. The objective was, therefore, to investigate how external load variables affect recovery markers up to 72 h post-match. Methods: Semiprofessional players from six teams wore tracking devices during three experimental football matches. External load variables including individual playing duration, total distance, PlayerLoadTM, high-intensity running, and high-intensity events were derived from the tracking devices, and blood samples and performance tests from 24-59 players were undertaken post-match. The effect of the external load variables on creatine kinase, myoglobin, and countermovement jump at 1, 24, 48, and 72 h, and 30-m sprint and Yo-Yo intermittent recovery tests level 1 at 72 h post-match, were modeled. Effects were gauged as two standard deviations of the external load and interpreted as the difference between a typical high-load and a typical low-load match. The effects were evaluated with 90% confidence intervals and magnitude-based inferences. Results: High-intensity running had very likely substantial effects on creatine kinase and myoglobin (moderate factor increases of 1.5-2.0 and 1.3-1.6 respectively), while duration, total distance, and HIE showed small, likely substantial effects. PlayerLoadTM and total distance had likely substantial effects on 30-m sprint time (small increases of 2.1-2.6%). Effects on countermovement jump performance were generally non-substantial. Despite these relationships, the uncertainty was too large to predict the recovery of individual players from the external load variables. Conclusions: This study provides evidence that external load variables have an effect on recovery markers up to 72 h post-match. Hence, tracking external load in matches may be helpful for practitioners when managing training load and recovery strategies post-match. However, it is recommended that several different external load variables are monitored. Future research should continue to address the problem of predicting recovery from external load variables.","2019","2020-05-20 00:21:53","2020-05-20 00:21:53","","","","JUN","10","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2019.00689; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628533064","adult; football player; human; human experiment; male; article; football; workload; performance; prediction; blood sampling; high intensity interval training; creatine kinase; creatine kinase blood level; jumping; protein blood level; biological marker; exercise recovery; anthropometric parameters; myoglobin; anthropometric device","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Twenty-two professional soccer players participated in this study: four central defenders, four wide defenders, nine central midfielders, three wide forwards, and three strikers. Total distance (TD), running distance (RD), sprinting distance (SD), number of sprints (NS), and player's training load (PL) were recorded by GPS units. Within-format analyses revealed very likely large increases in TD (20.0%, [9.2; 31.9]; effect size (ES): 1.48, [0.71; 2.25]) and RD (130.9%, [20.2; 343.7]; ES: 1.32, [0.29; 2.35]) during the regular game when compared to the ball possession game in the 5 vs 5 format. In the 10 vs 10 format, large increases in TD (27.9%, [17.7; 39.1]; ES: 3.54, [2.34; 4.74]) and PL (27.4%, [12.6; 44.1]; ES: 2.46, [1.20; 3.72]) were observed in the regular condition when compared to the ball possession condition. Between-formats analyses revealed that, in the 10 vs 10 format, when compared to the 5 vs 5 format, RD was very likely larger (123.5%, [33.7; 273.7]), as was SD (195.8%, [20.5; 626.2]). However, very likely large decreases in PL were observed in the 10 vs 10 format (-19.6%; [-29.4; -8.3]) in the ball possession condition. Unclear differences were revealed based on variations in external load variables between formats in the regular condition. Smaller formats reduce the area available for running and sprinting and, thus, may be more adequate for increasing player's training load (based on accelerometer data).

Six male professional footballers (mean ± standard deviation [SD]; 26 ± 2 years, 79.0 ± 4.9 kg, 1.82 ± 0.05 m) participated. Heart rate variability (HRV) was recorded using a smartphone application prior to the daily training sessions (247 training sessions [41.17 ± 7.41 per player]). External TL was monitored during training using global positioning system devices. Linear mixed models were used to examine variations in HRV and TL across the study period and to determine relationships between HRV and TL. Differences in TL and HRV were expressed as standardised effect sizes (ES) ± 90% confidence limits. Changes in HRV (outcome) were expressed as the expected change for a 2-SD change in TL (predictor). Across the study period, all external TL measures varied substantially, demonstrating weekly fluctuations in load (ES range = 0.00-7.40). The relationship between morning HRV and external TL ranged from −0.10 for distance and 1.89 for equivalent distance index (EDI). Overall, EDI demonstrated the strongest relationship with morning HRV; therefore, EDI and smartphone-derived HRV may provide an indicator of readiness to train within elite soccer.

To support this statement, the aims of this study were: (i) describe the collective behavioural patterns that relies upon the use of player positioning in interaction with teammates, opponents and ball positioning; (ii) and define the underlying structure among the variables through application of a factorial analysis. The sample comprised a total of 1,413 ball possession sequences, obtained from twelve elite football matches from one team (the team ended the season in the top-5 position). The dynamic position of the players (from both competing teams), as well as the ball, were captured and transformed to two-dimensional coordinates. Data included the ball possession sequences from six matches played against top opponents (TOP, the three teams classified in the first 3 places at the end of the season) and six matches against bottom opponents (BOTTOM, the three teams classified in the last 3 at the end of the season). The variables calculated for each ball possession were the following: ball position; team space in possession; game space (comprising the outfield players of both teams); position and space at the end of ball possession. Statistical comparisons were carried with magnitude-based decisions and null-hypothesis analysis and factor analysis to define the underlying structure among variables according to the considered contexts. Results showed that playing against TOP opponents, there was ~38 meters game length per ~43 meters game width with 12% of coefficient of variation (%). Ball possessions lasted for ~28 seconds and tended to end at ~83m of pitch length. Against BOTTOM opponents, a decrease in the game length with an increase in game width and in the deepest location was observed in comparison with playing against TOP opponents. The duration of ball possession increased considerable (~37 seconds), and the ball speed entropy was higher, suggesting lower levels of regularity in comparison with TOP opponents. The BOTTOM teams revealed a small EPS. The Principal Component Analysis showed a strong association of the ball speed, entropy of the ball speed and the coefficient of variation (%) of the ball speed. The EPS of the team in possession was well correlated with the game space, especially the game width facing TOP opponents. Against BOTTOM opponents, there was a strong association of ball possession duration, game width, distance covered by the ball, and length/width ratio of the ball movement. The overall approach carried out in this study may serve as the starting point to elaborate normative models of positioning behaviours measures to support the coaches’ operating decisions.","2019","2020-05-20 00:21:59","2020-05-20 00:21:59","","","","8","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0221368; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002677579","human; article; football; season; velocity; pitch; principal component analysis; factor analysis; entropy; null hypothesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The diagnostic and prognostic importance of pupil findings in severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) is well established. Objective pupillometry has been proposed as a potential screening tool for mild TBI's. Methods: Consent was obtained during initial collegiate athletes physical evaluations across all sports at Auburn University. Pupil function was tested using a Neuroptics NPi-200 infrared Pupillometer which obtained the neurological pupil index (NPi) which consists of 7 measures of pupil function. Data was also obtained of athletes who sustained concussions during their respective season. Results: Pupil measures were completed for 5001 athletes across 18 sports during the 3 year collection period. Substantial variation was measured across all parameters except for constriction latency (P = 0.21). Degree of pupil constriction was most among football players compared to other athletes (P 0.0001), while both mean and maximum constriction velocity was fastest among men's (P < 0.0001) and women's (P < 0.0001) basketball. Concussed athletes showed a decline in percent constriction, constriction velocity and maximum constriction velocity after = to 9 days with gradual return to baseline. Minimum constriction velocity's were significant for the majority of female soccer athletes but not mens football athletes during a single season. Conclusions: There is substantial variation among non-concussed collegiate athletes pupil function which varies with sport participation. Pupil velocity dynamics do not appear to show an immediate decline after concussion but rather follow a pattern of decline in the first week with a rapid improvement to baseline. Female soccer but not men football athletes showed a significant ""subconcussive"" change in velocity measures. Significance: We prove that the pupillary light reflex is altered in athletes and that pupillometry has potential to be used as a non-invasive and objective tool for concussion management.","2019","2020-05-20 00:22:01","2020-05-20 00:22:01","","144","","2","29","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/JSM.0000000000000724; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629860257","adult; conference abstract; female; football player; human; male; soccer; basketball; controlled study; season; concussion; student athlete; eye; physical examination; traumatic brain injury; nervous system; infrared radiation; pupil reflex; pupillometer; pupillometry","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

'Starkick' is a community run Australian rules football program for children of all abilities, with children wearing the same team uniform, playing on the same field at the same time as their typically developing peers. Patients and Methods: Thirty-seven parents of children with developmental disabilities (5-13y) participating in Starkick completed the Participation and Environment Measure - Children and Youth (PEMCY). In addition, 20 parents completed a semi-structured telephone interview answering questions pertaining to their child's participation in Starkick. Results: Parents listed 268 strategies to facilitate participation in the PEMCY: 95 for home, 88 for school and 85 for community. Ten themes in four categories were identified: child (social skills, emotional self-agency), task (environment modification, coaching, physical modification) family (function, competence, finances), and service providers (advice/resources, communication). The most frequent themes were family functioning (70%), task coaching (40%), child emotional selfagency (35%), and child social skills (32%). Children had the highest frequency of participation and involvement in the home environment and the lowest frequency and involvement in the community. Following Starkick the frequency and involvement in school and community increased significantly. Parent interviews revealed six key points. Their child experienced a sense of belonging, team fellowship, having fun, making friends, acceptance, and social support. Coaches' and volunteers' attitudes and skills were important. Conclusion: Opportunities for participation in community sporting programs have the potential to effect change for children with disabilities in home, school, and community environments.","2019","2020-05-20 00:22:03","2020-05-20 00:22:03","","32","","","61","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/dmcn.14244; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628003852","conference abstract; female; human; male; clinical article; sport; adolescent; child; volunteer; friend; developmental disorder; family functioning; finance; handicapped child; home environment; social competence; social support; structured interview","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study sought to specifically quantify the factors that contribute towards player head impact exposure in college football practices. All players included in this study were outfitted with football helmets instrumented with accelerometer arrays (Head Impact Telemetry System). Head impact exposure was defined by the number of head impacts each player experienced in practice, the number of practice head impacts normalized by the number of practice sessions (practice head impact rate), and the 95th percentile linear and rotational resultant head impact accelerations. Practice head impact rate was observed to vary significantly with player position (p < 0.0001; η2 = 0.46), team (p = 0.0016; η2 = 0.03), and the number of game impacts (p < 0.0001; η2 = 0.03), which served as a correlate for player ability. Even after controlling for practice participation, player position, team, and ability, differences between individuals accounted for 48% of the variance in head impact exposure in practice. This work demonstrates the importance of considering head impact exposure on a subject-specific basis rather than estimating head impact exposure from aggregate data.","2019","2020-05-20 00:22:04","2020-05-20 00:22:04","","2086-2093","","10","47","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628342045; http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10439-019-02309-x","human; article; football; biomechanics; physical activity; priority journal; accelerometer; accelerometry; head injury; risk factor; correlational study; college student; exposure; neurologic examination; head impact; football practice; practice head impact rate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: We conducted semi-structured one-on-one interviews in English and Spanish with 20 lesbian and bisexual cisgender Latina women in Chicago. Questions focused on identity and intersectionality; relationships with healthcare providers, the mechanism of disclosure and shared decision making; particularly involving decisions about healthy and unhealthy diet, and exercise. Examples of these questions include: "" Tell me about how your identities (racial/ethnic and sexual orientation/gender identity) affect your thoughts about healthy and unhealthy eating,"" and "" Have you ever talked with a healthcare provider about healthy and/or unhealthy eating, exercise and/or body image?"" The interviews were later transcribed verbatim. A codebook was developed, transcripts were double coded and entered into NVIVO, and themes were analyzed using modified Grounded Theory. Fifteen of the interviews were conducted in English and five in Spanish. Results: Of the 20 participants, the average age was 33 years old. Fourteen or 70% of them identified as lesbian and six (30%) identified as bisexual, pansexual, or queer. All of them identified as a cisgender woman and as Latina/Hispanic. Participants indicated that cultural traditions and norms (i.e. carnitas, tortillas, chorizo) can pose as barriers to healthy eating patterns. On the other hand, some participants stated that being part of the queer community has endorsed healthier eating patterns and exposed them to healthy foods not endemic to their popular cultural traditions (i.e. vegan diets). With regards to physical activity, participants' cultural heritage, comfort and safety, and stereotypes about certain sports (i.e. soccer or softball) influenced their decisions around physical activity more so than their sexual minority identities. Participants described the stress of having to educate their providers on queer lifestyle, which they described as awkward and wasting time where they could otherwise be asking questions of their own. The recommendations were for providers to take a patient-centered, individualized counseling approach and engage them in dialogue about healthy eating and exercise. Conclusions: Identity and behavior is inextricably connected. Participants' decisions around eating and exercise were heavily impacted by their multiple intersecting identities (race/ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, SES and employment status). Raising awareness among providers about intersectionality and factors that influence patients' decision making is an essential place to start for reducing disparities and further supporting the health equity of this population.","2019","2020-05-20 00:22:07","2020-05-20 00:22:07","","S222","","2","34","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/11606.1525-1497; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629003917","adult; conference abstract; female; human; male; soccer; clinical article; exercise; physical activity; controlled study; ethnicity; race; genetic transcription; healthy lifestyle; awareness; interview; stress; obesity; health care personnel; bisexuality; body image; comfort; counseling; drug safety; eating; employment status; gender identity; grounded theory; health equity; Hispanic; homosexual female; Illinois; inheritance; primary medical care; shared decision making; stereotypy; unhealthy diet; vegan diet","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For players in the National Football League (NFL), return requires not only surgery and extensive rehabilitation but also the ability to compete in a market with limited positions that annually introduces new recruits. Purpose/Hypothesis: We authors sought to evaluate factors related to return to play (RTP) and changes in performance following a primary Achilles tear. Our hypothesis was that ""skilled"" position players and those drafted in later rounds would return at a lower rate as compared with ""unskilled"" position players and higher draft-round players. Study Design: Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: From a previously established database, 80 NFL players were identified as having primary Achilles tendon tears between the 2009 and 2014 seasons. RTP was defined as playing in a regular season or postseason game following injury. Probability of RTP was modeled as a function of time after injury in Kaplan-Meier analysis with demographic variables assessed via generalized linear models. Twelve players (15%) experienced a subsequent Achilles tendon tear during or after the study period and were included in the overall RTP rate but were excluded from performance analyses owing to the confounding effects of an ipsilateral retear or contralateral tear. Results: The overall RTP rate was 61.3%. Age, number of prior seasons, position type, or draft round status did not significantly affect RTP when evaluated with Kaplan-Meier analysis. In the season before their injury, players who did RTP played in a significantly greater number of regular season games (13.7) compared with players who did not RTP (8.71) (P = .011). Players who did not RTP exhibited a significant decrease in performance in the season preceding injury (12.7 regular season games played 2 seasons preinjury vs 8.71 regular season games played 1 season prior preinjury;, P = .019). Players who returned did not display a significant change in the number of games played or started in seasons following injury when >1 season after return was evaluated. Conclusion: Rate of RTP following primary Achilles tendon tears may be lower than previously published. However, for those able to return, performance only in the season immediately following injury appears to be affected; players return to preinjury levels if given the opportunity to play >1 season after injury.","2019","2020-05-20 00:22:09","2020-05-20 00:22:09","","1-8","","3","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","","","","https://gateway.library.qut.edu.au/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=c8h&AN=135853420&site=ehost-live&scope=site","Adult; Football; Human; Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient; Descriptive Statistics; Athletic Performance -- Evaluation; Athletic Injuries; Athletes; Case Control Studies; Comparative Studies; Seasons; Body Mass Index; Achilles Tendon Rupture; Age Factors; Kaplan-Meier Estimator; Models, Statistical; Pearson's Correlation Coefficient; Reinjury; Sample Size; Sports Re-Entry -- Psychosocial Factors; Tears and Lacerations; Time Factors; Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this study was to investigate factors affecting the stadium attendance of the supporters of professional football clubs that have stadiums meeting the UEFA criteria. Methods. The study population included the supporters of Galatasaray Sport Club, Fenerbahce Sport Club and Kayserispor football clubs participating in the Spor Toto Super League-Turkey in the 2013-2014 seasons and having stadiums that meet the UEFA criteria. The sample consists of randomly selected (n = 1237) supporters. Additionally, demographic data of the supporters, reasons affecting the Stadium Attendance and Non-Attendance Reason Scale (SANARS) which consists of 30 questions were used to collect the data. Statistical analysis of the data was done using the SPSS 16.0 packet program and descriptive statistics, independent t-test and one-way ANOVA test were performed. Results. Generally, factors affecting the stadium attendance of the supporters were as follows: opportunity for recreational activities, stadium atmosphere, and personal relaxation. On the other hand, the factors generally affecting the supporters' nonattendance were as follows: negative ergonomic environment and unethical situations. Conclusion. Among the factors affecting the supporters' attendance in the stadiums, the component of ""Opportunity for Recreational Activities"" was found to be the most influential factor. This revealed the necessity of increasing the number of high quality organizations related to recreational activities in the stadiums. In this study, the factor of ""Negative Ergonomic Environment"" was found to be the most influential factor influencing stadium attendance. In conclusion, negative ergonomic environmental conditions need to be improved to increase stadium attendance.

Game location (home/away), points differential between team scores, distances between team stadiums (short [<483 km], moderate [484–836 km], long [837–1331 km] or very long [>1332 km]), crowd number, differences in team penalty counts (penalty differential), penalty yardage differential and time zone change (Eastward or Westward direction of travel) data from two non-consecutive NCAA college football seasons (2013 and 2016; 719 games; 222 teams) were obtained. Matches played at home were associated with a ~5 point advantage (ES = 0.58 ± 0.18). Away teams traveling >484 km resulted in a moderate disadvantage (~5 to 7 points, ES = −0.61 to −0.77). When crossing time zones in a Westerly direction resulted in a ~7.5 point disadvantage (ES = −0.82 ± 0.31) for away teams. When playing at Home, larger crowds resulted in a ~6 point advantage (ES = 0.67 ± 0.36), whilst larger crowds were negatively associated with performance (~8 points; 2 points) for away teams (ES = −0.97 ± 0.27). These results suggest HA exists in NCAA Division I football, particularly evident with larger crowds. These results provide evidence that could aid logistical or periodisation strategies in preparation for games.

METHODS: Data were collected from one team (45 athletes) during the 2017 season. Self-reported wellness was collected daily (4=best score possible, 28=worst score possible). External load/session availability variables were calculated using global positioning systems/session availability data from every training session and match. Additional variables included demographic data, pre-season external loads and strength/power measures. Linear mixed models were built and compared using root mean square error (RMSE) to determine the impact of variables on wellness. RESULTS: The external load variables explained wellness to a large degree (RMSE=1.55, 95% confidence intervals=1.52 to 1.57). Modelling athlete ID as a random effect appeared to have the largest impact on wellness, improving the RMSE by 1.06 points. Aside from athlete ID, the variable that had the largest (albeit negligible) impact on wellness was sprint distance covered across pre-season. Every additional 2.1 km covered across pre-season worsened athletes' in-season wellness scores by 1.2 points (95% confidence intervals=0.0 to 2.3). CONCLUSION: The isolated impact of the individual variables on wellness was negligible. However, after accounting for the individual athlete variability, the external load variables examined collectively were were able to explain wellness to a large extent. These results validate the sensitivity of wellness to monitor individual athletes' responses to the external loads imposed on them.","2019","2020-05-20 00:22:16","2020-05-20 00:22:16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1249/MSS.0000000000002244; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L630493050","football player; human; article; season; global positioning system; demography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, empirical research has primarily focused on sport's role for emotional-affectice rather than cognitive aspects of national identity. Therefore, research presented here explores whether identification with the German national soccer team serves to reinforce ethnic or civic conceptions of national identity. Analyses of a unique dataset conducted during the 2014 FIFA World Cup and the 2016 EURO show that national team identification is an important determinant of national pride and national belonging. Respondents who identify with the national soccer team can adhere to different conceptions of national identity. It seems that national pride and affection as well as conceptions of national identity represent stable attitudes not affected by the success of the national team. Further research should improve conceptual clarity and measurement.

METHODS: 22 male futsal players were evaluated in countermovement jump, 10-m sprint, creatine kinase, total quality of recovery (TQR), and Brunel Mood Scale (fatigue and vigor) before and immediately and 3, 24, and 48 h posttraining. Hierarchical cluster analysis allocated players to different recovery profiles using the area under the curve (AUC) of the percentage differences from baseline. One-way ANOVA compared the time course of each variable and players' characteristics between clusters. RESULTS: Three clusters were identified and labeled faster recovery (FR), slower physiological recovery (SLphy), and slower perceptual recovery (SLperc). FR presented better AUC in 10-m sprint than SLphy (P = .001) and SLperc (P = .008), as well as better TQR SLphy (P = .018) and SLperc (P = .026). SLperc showed better AUC in countermovement jump than SLphy (P = .014) but presented worse fatigue AUC than SLphy (P = .014) and FR (P = .008). AUC of creatine kinase was worse in SLphy than in FR (P = .001) and SLperc (P < .001). The SLphy players were younger than SLperc players (P = .027), whereas FR were slower 10-m sprinters than SLphy players (P = .003) and SLperc (P = .013) and tended to have higher maximal oxygen consumption than SLphy (effect size =1.13).

J Strength Cond Res 33(11): 3092-3097, 2019-The aim of this study was to describe and compare the distances and displacement speeds of U12 Soccer-7 athletes during 4 tournament Soccer-7 games (TG) played in less than 24 hours (experimental condition) with those recorded during 2 league Soccer-7 games (LG) with 24 hours of rest before the match (control condition). Ten participants (age = 10.3 ± 0.5 years) were recruited for the study. Main data analyzed during games included distance completed relative to match duration (Drel), maximal velocity, and distance completed at different running speeds (including acceleration, deceleration, standing, walking, jogging, medium-intensity running, high-intensity running, and sprinting). For data collection during games, athletes wore a global positioning system unit. Different (p ≤ 0.05) mean playing time was recorded during TG and LG (15.1 and 31.8 minutes/match, respectively). Drel during the 4 TG was maintained between 85.7 ± 8.5 and 87.5 ± 8.5 m·min (p > 0.05) and during the 2 LG between 84.2 ± 10.9 and 87.5 ± 9.9 m·min (p > 0.05). Moreover, similar Drel was recorded during TG and LG (86.8 and 85.9 m·min, respectively). Compared with LG, during TG, maximal velocity was lower (23.0 and 21.3 km·h, respectively; p ≤ 0.05). In addition, compared with the last game of the tournament, in the preceding games, the distance covered at low speeds (3.1-8.0 km·h) was lower (37.7 and 32.4%, respectively; p ≤ 0.05) and at high speeds (≥18.1 km·h) tends to be higher (2.5 and 3.3%, respectively). Therefore, compared with the control condition, accumulated Soccer-7 games with less than 24 hours of interday rest negatively affect displacement speed distribution (but not overall relative distances) in U12 Soccer-7 athletes.

Methods: Prospective feasibility study. Fifteen-minute treatments were given using traditional needle acupuncture after = practices of 2 high school football teams to capture the effect on delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS). Time, cost, side effects and participant to provider ratio were observed. Effect on DOMS and sense ofwell-being were measured via pre- and posttreatment VAS (0-10) rating analyses. Results: Forty-two male participants, mean age 16.0 years, were involved in at least one of 5 treatments for a total of 147 individual treatment sessions. Total time per treatment day was 75 minutes; total cost, $700; temperature range 21 to 28°C, largest participant to acupuncturist ratio, 7 to 10:1. No major side effects occurred. Fifty-five percent reported minimal side effects, most commonly numbness or tingling. Overall pre-to posttreatment effect on DOMS (average over = days) demonstrated significantly improved posttreatment scores (pre 4.6 ± 2.0; post 2.9 ± 2.2, P < 0.001). There was no significant pre-post treatment effect on sense of well-being (P = 0.12). Conclusions: Efficiently and effectively providing acupuncture to multiple adolescent football players in their training environment is feasible with the appropriate staff and resources. Despite mild side-effects, treatment was very well tolerated. Significance: This unique study may provide guidance on the delivery of acupuncture to other athletes in their training environments.","2019","2020-05-20 00:22:29","2020-05-20 00:22:29","","126","","2","29","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/JSM.0000000000000724; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629860272","conference abstract; football player; human; male; clinical article; controlled study; prospective study; adolescent; high school; hypesthesia; wellbeing; muscle; feasibility study; acupuncture; acupuncturist; side effect","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A novel cardiac POCUS screening protocol, Screening the Heart of the Athlete Research Program (SHARP), was developed for nonexpert examiners to assess common structural etiologies associated with sudden cardiac arrest/death (SCA/D). Methods: Assessment of primary outcomes of feasibility, and reliability of obtained measurements, performed by comparison to formal transthoracic echocardiogram was undertaken. Inter-rater reliability was based on Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) defined as moderate for 0.40 to 0.59, good for 0.60 to 0.79, and excellent for 0.80 or greater. Electrocardiograms (ECGs) were also obtained. Identification of disease or other abnormalities was a secondary outcome. Results: Fifty varsity athletes at our institution underwent the SHARP protocol, with 19 undergoing formal transthoracic echocardiogram and ECG for comparison. POCUS image quality was good to excellent. Feasibility of assessing for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, aortic root dilatation, and left-ventricular function was deemed highly possible but limited in 20% for right-ventricular assessment. Reliability was good for measurements of interventricular septal thickness (0.67), end diastolic left-ventricular diameter (0.61), aortic root diameter (0.63), and moderate for left-ventricular posterior wall thickness (0.42). No cardiovascular abnormalities were detected. Conclusions: A novel, comprehensive SHARP POCUS protocol performed by nonexpert practitioners demonstrated feasibility and reliability to assess varsity level athletes for common structural etiologies associated with SCA/D. Further large athlete screening cohort studies are required to validate the SHARP protocol and the role of cardiac POCUS as a screening modality.","2019","2020-05-20 00:22:31","2020-05-20 00:22:31","","35-41","","1","35","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cjca.2018.11.003; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2001411308","adult; female; human; male; article; football; rugby; basketball; clinical article; controlled study; athlete; ice hockey; echography; sudden cardiac death; transthoracic echocardiography; aortic root; physical examination; intermethod comparison; heart right ventricle; interventricular septum; health care cost; hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; rowing; false positive result; screening test; heart left ventricle wall; interrater reliability; echocardiograph; heart left ventricle function; heart left ventricle volume; image quality; point of care testing; portable ultrasound scanner; Vivid; Vscan","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, few studies have focused on mixed-type trained athletes such as rugby football players. Rugby players train differently according to the field position. The aim of this study was to investigate morphological and functional characteristics of left ventricle (LV) in young rugby players. Methods and Results: We studied 47 freshman athletes (all male, 18.6± 0.5 yrs old, and 8.0± 4.1 yrs of experience) in the collegiate rugby football team (Japan East College League group A). LV volume and functional indices were measured by two-dimensional echocardiography (2DE). The LV wall thickness and ejection fraction normally distributed in the athletes. Prevalence of deviation from the reference values of LV structure was as follows: 6% (3/47) in LV diastolic diameter (LVDd), 49% (23/47) in indexed LV diastolic volume, 32% (15/47) in indexed LV systolic volume, and 6% (3/47) in indexed LV mass. The athletes were divide into three groups according to their field position: group A, scrum first-row (n= 10); group B, scrum second- and third- row (n= 9); and group C, backs (n= 28). Body mass index, skeletal muscle index and body fat ratio in the body composition analysis were significantly greater in the group A than in the group C, whereas peak oxygen consumption determined by cardiopulmonary exercise testing was significantly lower in the group A than in the group C. In the 2DE study, the group C showed significantly greater indexed LVDd compared with the other groups. Indexed stroke volume in the group B was significantly greater than in the group A. Two dimensional myocardial speckle tracking analysis using Aplio400 (Toshiba Medical CO,Ltd) was performed. The global LV longitudinal strain was significantly attenuated in the group A (-14.4± 1.9%) than in the group B and C (-17.7± 2.2% in the B and -16.6± 1.8% in the C, p< 0.05 vs the A, respectively). The longitudinal strain was associated with the body fat ratio (r2 = 0.17, p < 0.05). LV circumferential and radial strain were not significantly different among the three groups. Conclusions: Eccentric cardiac remodeling but not concentric remodeling was more frequent in the first-year collegiate rugby players. The present results indicate that the rugby players exhibit the field position-specific LV adaptation. Further surveillance would be necessary for evaluating later-life cardiovascular health outcomes in the scrum first-row athletes.","2019","2020-05-20 00:22:34","2020-05-20 00:22:34","","i517","","","20","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ehjci/jey266; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L630843628","adult; conference abstract; human; male; football; rugby; aerobic capacity; clinical article; controlled study; athlete; body mass; outcome assessment; prevalence; exercise test; body fat; phenotype; heart left ventricle mass; two dimensional echocardiography; heart ventricle remodeling; thickness; reference value; heart ejection fraction; skeletal muscle; heart stroke volume; Japan; heart left ventricle wall; heart left ventricle volume; real time ultrasound scanner; two dimensional electrophoresis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Hence, we examined the short and long-term effects of the FIFA 11+ on performance in male amateur futsal players. METHODS: Seventy-one male futsal players from six amateur clubs were recruited and randomized to an intervention (N.=37, age: 27.0+5.1 years) or a control group (N.=34, age: 26.0+5.1 years). The intervention group was submitted to 10 weeks of FIFA 11+ injury prevention program, 2 sessions/week, followed by a 10-week follow-up period, while the control group performed regular futsal warm-ups during the training sessions. During the follow-up period both groups performed only regular warm-ups during their training sessions. Physical performance was assessed by measuring agility (T-test), sprint (30 m sprint), flexibility (sit-and-reach test) and vertical jump performance (squat jump). RESULTS: Differences between groups were found at baseline for training exposure, body mass index, body weight, flexibility, and sprint. The results of the effect of the FIFA 11+ on the sit-and-reach test, speed and agility did not show differences pre-post intervention, as well as for the 10-week follow-up. Jump performance, showed a significant difference in favor of the control group for the intervention period and the follow-up (crude β: -0.04 [95% CI: -0.06; -0.01]; -0.03 [95% CI: -0.06; -0.00], respectively), however after adjustment for the baseline differences the confidence interval fell out of the range of significance for the intervention and follow-up period (adjusted β, -0.05 [95% CI: -0.10; 0.00]; -0.05 [95% CI:-0.10; 0.04]).

The purpose of this case study was to apply a new analysis approach, so far only used for 1-versus-1 analyses in soccer, to small-sided games and to identify and analyse therewith the efficiency of tactical patterns in 3-versus-2 game play. Therefore, 279 games, performed by an elite youth soccer team, were recorded by video and a position tracking system. The data was processed by the new approach, including unsupervised machine learning routines and artificial intelligence methods. Two crucial moments were used to analyse the occurring tactical patterns for the specific game: T0 (time instant of the shot) and T1 (time instant of the last action before the shot). For both moments typical tactical patterns, considering the spatio-temporal context of the situations, were found. By combining the patterns of both moments, hidden tactical strategies were identified and their efficiencies calculated. The most significant result is that offence attempts have the highest scoring probability when played via the wings near to the goal line and the final pass, before the shot, is given against the playing direction into the centre of the field.

So, developing methods and algorithms for analyzing team sports has become one of the most popular topics among data scientists. Analyzing football is hard because of its complexity, number of events in each match, and constant flow of circulation of the ball. Finding roles of players with the purpose of analyzing the performance of a team or making a meaningful comparison between players is crucial. In this article, an automatic big data clustering method, based on a swarm intelligence algorithm, is proposed to automatically cluster the data set of players' performance centers in different matches and extract different kinds of roles in football. The proposed method created using particle swarm optimization algorithm has two phases. In the first phase, the algorithm searches the solution space to find the number of clusters and, in the second phase, it finds the positions of the centroids. To show the effectiveness of the algorithm, it is tested on six synthetic data sets and its performance is compared with two other conventional clustering methods. After that, the algorithm is used to find clusters of a data set containing 93,000 objects, which are the centers of players' performance in about 4900 matches in different European leagues.","2019","2020-05-20 00:22:38","2020-05-20 00:22:38","","35-56","","1","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/big.2018.0069; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L626886968","human; soccer; cluster analysis; algorithm; professional standard","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between ground reaction force kinetics at the first step and sprint running performance in soccer players in order to enhance the development of training and assessment methods. METHODS: Nineteen semi-professional soccer players participated (mean ± s: age 21.1 ± 1.9 years, body mass 79.4 ± 7.3 kg and stature 1.79 ± 0.06 m). The participants completed 20 m acceleration sprint runs as timing gates recorded split times between 0-5 m, 5-10 m, 10-15 m, 15-20 m and 0-20 m. A force plate captured vertical, anteroposterior and mediolateral ground reaction force data (1000 Hz) of the first right foot strike stance phase. RESULTS: Ground reaction force metrics, including peak anteroposterior propulsive force (r = 0.66 to 0.751; P = 0.000 to 0.002), peak vertical ground reaction force (r = 0.456 to 0.464; P = 0.045 to 0.05), average medial-lateral/anteroposterior orientation angle (r =-0.463; P = 0.023), and average anteroposterior/vertical orientation angle (r =-0.44; P = 0.03) were correlated with one or all split times between 0-5 m, 5-10 m, 10-15 m, 15-20 m and 0-20 m. CONCLUSIONS: Acceleration sprint running in soccer requires minimised mediolateral and increased anteroposterior loading in the stance phase. Multi-component ground reaction force measures of the first step in acceleration sprint runs are important for developing performance assessments, and understanding force application techniques employed by soccer players.","2019","2020-05-20 00:22:44","2020-05-20 00:22:44","","1-23","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17461391.2019.1629178; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628170332","adult; human; article; soccer player; acceleration; biomechanics; controlled study; young adult; running; body height; foot; ground reaction force; standing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The degree of neurological injury caused by subconcussive head trauma is not easily detectible, and this injury does not induce readily identifiable clinical signs or symptoms. Recent advancements in immunoassays make possible the detection and quantification of blood biomarkers linked to head trauma. Identification of a blood biomarker that can identify the extent of neurological injury associated with subconcussive head trauma may provide an objective measure for informed decisions concerning cumulative exposure to subconcussive head trauma. The purpose of the current study was to examine changes in the blood biomarkers of subconcussive head trauma over the course of an American football season. METHODS Thirty-five National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) American football athletes underwent blood sampling throughout the course of a football season. Serial samples were obtained throughout the 2016 season, during which the number and magnitude of head impacts changed. Blood samples were analyzed for plasma concentrations of tau and serum concentrations of neurofilament light polypeptide (NF-L). Athletes were grouped based on their starter status, because athletes identified as starters are known to sustain a greater number of impacts. Between-group differences and time-course differences were assessed. RESULTS In nonstarters, plasma concentrations of tau decreased over the course of the season, with lower values observed in starters; this resulted in a lower area under the curve (AUC) (starters: 416.78 ± 129.17 pg/ml/day; nonstarters: 520.84 ± 163.19 pg/ml/day; p = 0.050). Plasma concentrations of tau could not be used to discern between starters and nonstarters. In contrast, serum concentrations of NF-L increased throughout the season as head impacts accumulated, specifically in those athletes categorized as starters. The higher serum concentrations of NF-L observed in starters resulted in a larger AUC (starters: 1605.03 ± 655.09 pg/ml/day; nonstarters: 1067.29 ± 272.33 pg/ml/day; p = 0.007). The AUC of the receiver operating characteristic curve analyses displayed fair to modest accuracy to identify athletes who were starters with the use of serum NF-L following periods of repetitive impacts. CONCLUSIONS The different patterns observed in serum NF-L and plasma tau concentrations provide preliminary evidence for the use of blood biomarkers to detect the neurological injury associated with repetitive subconcussive head trauma. Although further investigation is necessary, such findings might lay the foundation for the further development of an objective measure for the detection of neurological injury caused by subconcussive head trauma.","2019","2020-05-20 00:22:48","2020-05-20 00:22:48","","1655-1662","","5","130","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.3171/2017.12.JNS172035; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2001905542","adult; human; article; football; sport injury; priority journal; young adult; blood sampling; cross-sectional study; head injury; longitudinal study; protein blood level; biological marker; tau protein; unclassified drug; neurofilament protein; diagnostic value; neurofilament light polypeptide; polypeptide","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Soccer-like games have been practiced since ancient times in various regions of the globe, with about 5,000 years of age. Origins of football can be found in all corners of the earthly world. They were celebrated in 2018, 156 years since a sportive game that for centuries developed by chance, living longer in the shadow of myths and legends, has made its own status, being caught in the rules of a regulation selfstanding and receiving a perfect organization set up by English. Conclusion. Throughout history, all civilizations have had round-ball games, many of which can be considered precursors to today's modern game, a game that was officially born in England in the nineteenth century. Ball games took place for the first time in Egypt before 1800 BC However there are voices claiming that such games were recorded even earlier in ancient China, probably earlier than 2500 BC. Today's soccer tactic, scientifically directed football differs radically from what has been practiced in the past. Using new methods has made today's game the expression of a pronounced physical commitment, speed, skill, strength and resilience being indispensable qualities for current players. The current soccer player is a complex athlete who, during training, sums up high indexes of all sports training factors.

OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to examine whether football in a real-world setting (i.e., local football clubs) was safe and feasible in practice and could improve quality of life, mitigate decline in muscle mass and bone density, and increase fat mass in patients with prostate cancer. METHODS: In this pragmatic, multicentre, parallel randomized controlled trial, men diagnosed with prostate cancer were recruited from five Danish urological departments. Men (N = 214) diagnosed with prostate cancer were randomly allocated, using random generated lists (block size 4-8) stratified for center and androgen-deprivation therapy status, to either 1 h of football twice weekly in a local football club or to usual care, which was a 15- to 30-min telephone session covering their options for physical activity or free-of-charge rehabilitation delivered as standard in Denmark. Allocation was concealed from the trial investigator performing the randomization, but-given the nature of the intervention-this was not possible for personnel and participants. Assessments were performed at baseline, 12 weeks, and 6 months. The primary outcome was mean change difference in prostate cancer-specific quality of life at 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes were body composition, 12-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) physical and mental health, and safety-reported as fractures, falls, and serious adverse events. RESULTS: Attrition was 1 and 3% at 12 weeks, and 5% and 5% at 6 months for the usual care and football groups, respectively. Prostate cancer-specific quality of life was equal between groups at 12 weeks (mean difference + 1.9 points, 95% confidence interval [CI] -1.0-4.8; P = 0.20) and at 6 months (+ 0.5 points, 95% CI -2.8-3.8; P = 0.76). Fractures were equally distributed, with two fractures in the usual care group and one in the football group. Likewise, body composition outcomes were equal. Mental health improved after 6 months of football (mean difference + 2.7 points, 95% CI 0.8-4.6; P = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: In this trial, community-based football was a feasible exercise strategy for men with prostate cancer. Football did not improve prostate cancer-specific quality of life but did improve mental health; the clinical significance of this is unclear.

The authors suggest that as ""unusual suspects"" in social movements, Çarşı's role in the Gezi Park protests can be understood with the conceptual toolbox provided by theories of contentious politics. Since action repertoires, or ""known sequences for acting together,"" are key to contentious politics and social movements, Çarşı's organized and effective performance during the Gezi Park protests shows how previous encounters with the police can be decisive in terms of social upheavals. This study suggests that Çarşı members, who were already accustomed to making ethical judgments on a variety of issues both political and non-political, should be taken as a prominent example of how supporters on terraces and fan clubs facilitate the framing processes described by the social movement literature.

The authors hypothesized that a football helmet with an outer shell would reduce both linear and rotational acceleration. The authors’ objectives were to 1) determine an optimal material for a shock-absorbing outer shell and 2) examine the ability of an outer shell to reduce linear and/or rotational acceleration. METHODS A laboratory-based investigation was undertaken using an extra-large Riddell Revolution football helmet. Two materials (Dow Corning Dilatant Compound and Sorbothane) were selected for their non-Newtonian properties (changes in viscosity with shear stress) to develop an outer shell. External pads were attached securely to the helmet at 3 locations: the front boss, the side, and the back. The helmet was impacted 5 times per location at 6 m/sec with pneumatic ram testing. Two-sample t-tests were used to evaluate linear/rotational acceleration differences between a helmet with and a helmet without the outer shell. RESULTS Sorbothane was superior to the Dow Corning compound in force reduction and recovered from impact without permanent deformation. Of 5 different grades, 70-duro (a unit of hardness measured with a durometer) Sorbothane was found to have the greatest energy dissipation and stiffness, and it was chosen as the optimal outer-shell material. The helmet prototype with the outer shell reduced linear acceleration by 5.8% (from 75.4g to 71.1g; p < 0.001) and 10.8% (from 89.5g to 79.8g; p = 0.033) at the side and front boss locations, respectively, and reduced rotational acceleration by 49.8% (from 9312.8 rad/sec2 to 4671.7 rad/sed2; p < 0.001) at the front boss location. CONCLUSIONS Sorbothane (70 duro) was chosen as the optimal outer-shell material. In the outer-shell prototype helmet, the results demonstrated a 5%–10% reduction in linear acceleration at the side and front boss locations, and a 50% reduction in rotational acceleration at the front boss location. Given the paucity of publicly reported helmet-design literature and the importance of rotational acceleration in head injuries, the substantial reduction seen in rotational acceleration with this outer-shell prototype holds the potential for future helmet-design improvements.","2019","2020-05-20 00:22:59","2020-05-20 00:22:59","","1634-1641","","5","130","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.3171/2018.1.JNS172733; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2001905539","human; article; football; acceleration; biomechanics; priority journal; controlled study; helmet; force; comparative study; absorption; energy; equipment design; hardness; linear acceleration; rigidity; rotational acceleration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Football, provided by professional football club community trusts could aid engagement in physical activity, however little is known about the behaviour change processes which engage individuals in this type of PA. One factor which is often overlooked is affect and exploring this could help identify the behaviour change processes, which engage individuals in a professional football club-led mental health intervention. The aim of this study was to explore the experiences of individuals attending football provided by a professional club community trust to further our understanding of the behaviour change processes involved in facilitating engagement in this provision. Method: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with twelve men who played football provided by a professional football club trust. A range of mental health problems were reported and the participants were aged between 19 and 46. Template analysis was conducted, implementing some of the concepts from the Affective – Reflective Theory (ART). Results: The results highlighted that both affective and reflective processes of ART were evident in engaging individuals in football. Pleasurable experiences were enabled through the physical and social characteristics of football. Self-control strategies emerged which help to action engagement. The professional football club trust provided coaching knowledge and skills, team organisation and resources and feelings of belonging and responsibility. Conclusion: Application of ART to the understanding of football experiences has provided a novel exploration of the processes involved in engaging individuals in football. This has important implications for intervention design; the focus should be on providing pleasurable experiences and fostering appropriate self-control strategies.","2019","2020-05-20 00:23:01","2020-05-20 00:23:01","","19-30","","","16","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mhpa.2019.02.002; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2001703264","adult; human; male; article; football; clinical article; physical activity; priority journal; professional knowledge; skill; depression; semi structured interview; personal experience; mental disease; mental health; social responsibility; behavior change; schizophrenia; Affective Reflective Theory; anxiety disorder; exploratory behavior; paranoia; self control; Social Cognitive Theory; social environment; social psychology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The pass positions were determined from the player positions measured by the automatic tracking system for soccer players. The pass positions were classified into clusters by clustering method. The pass network was created by the number of passes between different clusters. The present study analysed nine official games of Fagiano Okayama of Japan Professional Football League Division 2 in 2016 and 2017 years. The results showed that the pass network could abstractly represent the successful passes. Then, the network metrics such as the total links, degree centrality, scaled connectivity and cluster coefficient were evaluated. The total links and degree centrality were proportional to the number of passes. The scaled connectivity decreased with increasing the number of passes because the degree of the particular nodes increased. Moreover, the cluster coefficient of the node in the top 25% degree increased with increasing the number of passes. These results could provide useful information with respect to the team performance on the field.

The whole player focused FPHS is designed to deepen understanding of the benefits and risks of participation in ASF, identify risks that are potentially reversible or preventable, and develop interventions or approaches to improve the health and wellbeing of former players. We are recruiting and following a cohort of former professional ASF players who played since 1960 (current n = 3785). At baseline, participants complete a self-administered standardized questionnaire, including initial reporting of exposure history and physician-diagnosed health conditions. Additional arms of the initiative are addressing targeted studies, including promising primary, secondary, and tertiary interventions; extensive in-person clinical phenotyping, and legal and ethical concerns of the play. This paper describes the components of the FPHS studies undertaken and completed thus far, as well as those studies currently underway or planned for the near future. We present our initiatives herein as a potential paradigm of one way to proceed (acknowledging that it is not the only way). We share what we have learned so that it may be useful to others, particularly in regard to trying to make professional sports meet the needs of multiple stakeholders ranging from players to owners, to fans, and possibly even to parents making decisions for their children.","2019","2020-05-20 00:23:03","2020-05-20 00:23:03","","643-654","","8","62","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ajim.22991; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628398979","female; football player; human; human experiment; male; article; brain; major clinical study; cohort analysis; questionnaire; child; physician; phenotype; heart","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Guided by network theory, social-identity theory, and basking in reflective glory and using data of all players of all teams in the Dutch premier league (""Eredivisie""), the multilevel models show that players with a Twitter account were more popular when they scored more goals, were non-Dutch, were on loan at another club, and were networkers actively following others on Twitter. The findings also show that context matters. Players under contract with a successful club receive an automatic bonus: Irrespective of their performance on the pitch or on Twitter, they automatically acquire more followers on Twitter. Players in general do not need to put a lot of effort into communicating on Twitter because sending tweets is unrelated to having more followers. Advertisers' best options to reach larger and homogeneous audiences through football players are to choose attackers, scoring players, those out on loan, and foreign players, as well as players from successful teams in general. The study also identified which player characteristics do not add to a larger audience reach, such as tweeting behavior and experience on Twitter.

To address this imbalance, this paper analyses the technical efficiency and effectiveness of Italian football clubs, taking into consideration the impact of the Calciopoli corruption scandal in 2006. This allows assessment of how clubs' efficiency and effectiveness were affected by the sanctions inflicted on the clubs involved in the scandal. Research methods: Utilising a panel dataset comprising season aggregated match statistics over ten seasons from 2000/01 to 2009/10, this paper estimates a production function for the league and, then, calculates the relative offensive and defensive efficiency and the football effectiveness of 36 teams. To achieve this, DEA models have been used to calculate the frontiers of efficient production. Results and findings: The results partially confirm the evidence of the literature but they also reveal how playing style changed, emphasising the importance of attacking play at the expense of defensive play in Italian Serie A. Clubs that suffered a points deduction following their involvement in the Calciopoli scandal changed their usual tactical behaviour, presumably to compensate for the impact of these punishments. Implications: League authorities should be aware that the clubs' performance has been affected following the Calciopoli scandal sanctions, which may have contributed to the spectator decline. Furthermore, we identify offensive efficiency as the key determinant of team success, which is a helpful insight for team management with respect to their transfer and salary policy.

Methods: Ten semi-professional footballers underwent a control session (0-m) to quantify RS in a non-fatigued state; and three hypoxia sessions (0-m;1500-m;3000-m) examining RS and perceptual-cognitive skills for a given physical workload. The mean number of correct responses (%) for anticipation and decision-making accuracy were obtained at the 30-min mark of each half. HR, TC, RPE and %O2sat were measured during warm-up, football-induced fatigue and RS test. Results: HR, RPE and %O2sat were different between conditions (ES=0.44-6.13). RS were affected by football-induced fatigue for DC (4.8%;ES=0.68) and AV (5.5%;ES=0.79). In hypoxia, a 6.5% was found for DC, 6.3% for AV and 3.1% for PV at 1500-m compared to 0-m (P<0.05). Further significant changes of 12.8% DC, 12.8% AV and 6.2% PV (P<0.0005) were found at 3000-m compared to 0-m. More pronounced declines in perceptual-cognitive skills were found as altitude increased (5.0-12.5%;ES=1.17-2.41) and between halves (5.3-6.7%). Conclusion: The data demonstrates the RS test was sensitive to fatigue/hypoxia for a given physical load. Simulated matches in hypoxia revealed larger decreases, in RS and perceptual-cognitive skills, highlighting the need for optimal acclimatisation strategies, including physical and technical preparation, prior to playing at altitude.

While there remains a lack of clear evidence to test the hypothesis that contact sport participation is linked to an increased incidence of dementia, there is growing public concern regarding the risk. There is, therefore, a pressing need for research to gain greater understanding of the potential risks involved in contact sports participation, and to contextualise these within holistic health benefits of sport. Methods and analysis Football's InfluencE on Lifelong health and Dementia risk is designed as a retrospective cohort study, with the aim to analyse data from former professional footballers (FPF) in order to assess the incidence of neurodegenerative disease in this population. Comprehensive electronic medical and death records will be analysed and compared with those of a demographically matched population control cohort. As well as neurodegenerative disease incidence, all-cause, and disease-specific mortality, will be analysed in order to assess lifelong health. Cox proportional hazards models will be run to compare the data collected from FPFs to matched population controls. Ethics and dissemination Approvals for study have been obtained from the University of Glasgow College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences Research Ethics Committee (Project Number 200160147) and from National Health Service Scotland's Public Benefits and Privacy Panel (Application 1718-0120).","2019","2020-05-20 00:23:11","2020-05-20 00:23:11","","","","5","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2018-028654; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L627817487","football player; human; article; incidence; cohort analysis; retrospective study; risk factor; autopsy; contact sport; chronic traumatic encephalopathy; degenerative disease; dementia; mental health; health status; proportional hazards model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Assessing a skill requires external factors to dictate how and when the action is performed, highlighting the need for skill assessments to closely replicate the perception-action couplings experienced in football game play. Therefore, this study investigated if the Footbonaut is a valid and reliable football-specific skill assessment tool. Methods: Footbonaut performance scores from 152 male players from U12 to U23 representing a professional German Bundesliga club during the 2016/2017 season were analysed. Results: Pearson correlations (r) and coefficient of variation (CV) for the correct number of passes in a target (CV = 7.5–11.1; r = 0.48; p < 0.001), the speed at which they completed each trial (CV = 2.6–5.1; r = 0.70; p < 0.001), and a computer-generated point score (CV = 7.4–12.3; r = 0.77; p < 0.001) demonstrated acceptable test–retest reliability. Moreover, a MANOVA revealed a strong multivariate effect of age group on speed and accuracy combined (F = 7.80, p < 0.001, ES = 0.28), demonstrating the Footbonaut's construct validity. Conclusion: The results in this study demonstrated that the Footbonaut is a valid and reliable assessment of football-specific skill.

The impact of the international game on US soccer supporters from the 1994 World Cup to the present","Soccer & Society","","14660970","","","While compared with the big four professional sports in the United States, soccer remains a marginalized spectator sport; yet it has gained a sizable following over the past two decades. TV audiences and stadium attendance for domestic club matches are growing and supporters' groups that follow the professional sides have emerged and established themselves. Rather than being introduced to the game as fans of their local clubs, however, many passionate soccer fans in the United States continue to enter soccer fandom via the Men's and Women's National teams. The 1994 FIFA World Cup on home soil as well as the success of the Women's National Team thus play a prominent role in drawing new fans to the game, some of whom begin to follow the sport regularly in the form of domestic club games. For many of these fans, 'club' and 'country' remain complementing objects of soccer fandom rather than competing points of reference.

Methods: A total of 23 soccer players (age 20.8 [1.5] y) performed 10 maximal 30-m sprints wearing a WV with 5 different loads (0%, 10%, 20%, 30%, and 40% body mass [BM]). Sprint velocity and time were collected using a radar device and wireless photocells. Mechanical outputs were computed using a recently developed valid and reliable field method that estimates the step-averaged ground-reaction forces during overground sprint acceleration from anthropometric and spatiotemporal data. Raw velocity-time data were fitted by an exponential function and used to calculate the net horizontal ground-reaction forces and horizontal power output. Individual linear force-velocity relationships were then extrapolated to calculate the theoretical maximum horizontal force (F0) and velocity and the ratio of force application (proportion of the total force production that is directed forward at sprint start). Results: Magnitude-based inferences showed an almost certain decrease in F0 (effect size = 0.78-3.35), maximum power output (effect size = 0.78-3.81), and maximum ratio of force (effect size = 0.82-3.87) as the load increased. The greatest changes occurred with loads heavier than 20% BM, especially in ratio of force. In addition, the maximum power was achieved under unloaded conditions. Conclusions: Increasing load in WV sprinting affects spatiotemporal and kinetic variables. The greatest change in ratio of force happened with loads heavier than 20% BM. Thus, the authors recommend the use of loads ≤20% BM for WV sprinting.","2019","2020-05-20 00:23:15","2020-05-20 00:23:15","","747–756","","6","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1123/ijspp.2018-0490; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628139668","human; soccer; acceleration; athlete; young adult; physiology; running; cross-sectional study; athletic performance; weight bearing; kinetics; spatiotemporal analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of this study was to determine the acute changes in kinematics and kinetics when wearable resistance (WR) of 1 kg (equivalent to ∼1% body mass) was attached to each forearm during over ground short distance (20 m) maximal sprint-running. Design: Cross-sectional study. Methods: Twenty-two male amateur rugby athletes (19.4 ± 0.5 years; 97.0 ± 4.8 kg; 180.4 ± 7.2 cm) volunteered to participate in the study. Radar and Optojump were used to examine kinematic and kinetics between WR and unloaded sprint-running conditions. Results: No significant (p < 0.05) differences were found at 2 m or 5 m between conditions, however, the WR condition resulted in a significant increase in 10 m, 20 m and 10–20 m split time (all, ∼2%, small effect size) compared to the unloaded condition. Significant decreases were also found in theoretical maximum velocity (V0) (−1.4%, small effect size) and relative peak horizontal power production (Pmax) (−5.5%, small effect size). Step length (2.1%, small effect size) and contact time (6.5%, medium effect size) were significantly increased, while step frequency (−4.1%, small effect size) and flight time (−5.3%, medium effect size) were significantly decreased. Conclusions: WR forearm loading provides a movement specific overload of the arms which significantly alters step kinematics and sprint times ≥10 m.","2019","2020-05-20 00:23:16","2020-05-20 00:23:16","","348-352","","3","22","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsams.2018.08.012; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2001098886","adult; human; male; theoretical study; article; rugby; controlled study; athlete; running; cross-sectional study; telecommunication; effect size; kinematics; forearm; contact time; kinetics; step length","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In our experimental analysis, we consider the potential influence of a cost-sensitive approach rather than traditional machine-learning methods. Although the measurement of prediction accuracy is a very important part of the validation of each model, we also study its economic significance. As a performance metric for our models, the Sharpe ratio metric is calculated and analyzed. Seeking to improve Sharpe ratio value, a genetic algorithm is applied. The empirical study and evaluation procedure of the paper are primarily based on English Premier League's games, simple historical data and well-known bookmakers' markets odds.

However, long-term follow up in talent development programmes in youth soccer is complicated. Therefore, the aim of this study was to forecast the developmental trajectories of explosive leg power in youth soccer players. Methods: Mixed effects regression models were used to forecast explosive leg power (countermovement (CMJ) and standing broad jump (SBJ)) in a longitudinal sample of 2201 youth soccer players from two high level Belgian acedemies and the Belgian National teams. Players were aged between 6 and 20 years (mean age = 13.04 ± 3.18 y) and were subdivided into three age cohorts (6–10, 11–15, and 16–20 y) for CMJ and two age cohorts (6–16, and 17–20 y) for SBJ. Results: This study was able to accurately forecast explosive leg power using different regression equations in each age cohort. Conclusions: Researchers, coaches, and sporting professionals can use these methods to either predict future explosive leg power from current performance measures, monitor the development of explosive leg power, or assess the effectiveness of training interactions aimed at altering predicted developmental trajectories.

From the tactical point of view, findings show that there are higher areas of play and relationships, and interactions between players / teams with greater distances, in the 8-a-side soccer format. From the conditional point of view, 7-a-side soccer is somewhat more demanding than 8-a-side soccer, since it presents more prolonged and more intense efforts.

Small-sided games (SSGs) are extensively used in soccer training around the world owing to the physical and physiological improvements reported among athletes. Elementary physical education students could achieve and solidify their tactical/technical knowledge in a relatively short time with the SSGs pedagogical strategy. The aim of this research was, firstly, to establish the between-age differences in the physical and physiological demands of a 3 vs. 3 futsal SSGs called 'four goals for three players,' and, secondly, to assess the tactical/technical knowledge acquisition. Methods. The sample involved 57 students (aged 10.44 ± 1.30 years) from a Spanish primary state school, grades third to sixth (8-12 years of age). The Polar Team ProTM technology was used for collecting physical and physiological variables. The tactical/technical knowledge was evaluated with the Game Performance Assessment Instrument (GPAI) co-assessment throughout SSGs implementation. ANOVA tests were executed. Results. Significantly different values were observed among different grades regarding the participants' average heart rate (bpm), minimum heart rate (bpm), maximum speed (km/h), number of accelerations (-1.99; -1.00 m/s2), number of accelerations (-0.99; -0.50 m/s2), number of accelerations (0.50; 0.99 m/s2), and number of accelerations (1.00; 1.99 m/s2 ). The analysis of variance for GPAI scores revealed significantly greater values only among different grades for the implication of game and shot decision-making index. Conclusions. Physiological demands and tactical/technical knowledge are also observed in educational context when SSGs are implemented. This pedagogical strategy helps teachers increase active participation during physical education sessions.

Background: Heterotopic ossifications are not uncommon following surgical fixation of the tibiofibular syndesmosis. Typically, properly healed fibular fractures do not result in further complications associated with heterotopic ossification. Treatment: A 21-year-old collegiate football player (1.8 m, 77.1 kg) reported to the athletic training staff complaining of acute lateral ankle pain following a plant and twist mechanism while running receiving routes. Initial evaluation led to a diagnosis of a syndesmotic ankle sprain, with a plan to pursue conservative management. When patient was unable to participate in the following practice due to intensity of pain, the patient was referred for x-rays a revealed poorly healed Weber Type C fracture that had been mislabeled as a Maisonneuve fracture at the patient's previous university. This previous injury led to a heterotopic ossification of the syndesmosis that had fractured during the more recent injury. With this new diagnosis, the patient consented to conservative treatment that allowed the patient to return to football activities the following offseason. Uniqueness: While heterotopic ossification of the ankle syndesmosis has been reported in literature, there has yet to be extensive research on the condition. Generally, when these ossifications become symptomatic best practices involve surgical removal. In spite of presenting with symptoms, the patient was able to return to full participation following conservative treatment. Conclusion: When providing patient care, accurate diagnosis is crucial to optimal outcomes. Caring for patients in a collegiate setting presents a unique number of instances of patient care transfer, which may make previous misdiagnosis hard to recognize. Diligent health care practitioners should always ensure that a comprehensive medical history is obtained in order to make an accurate assessment.

METHODS: Exposure and fracture data over 7.5 consecutive seasons (2009/10 until the first half of 2016/17) were collected from two media-based register (transfermarkt.de® and kicker.de®). RESULTS: Overall, 357 fractures from 290 different players were recorded with an incidence of 0.19/1000 hours of exposure (95% CI: 0.14-0.24). Most fractures in German elite soccer players involved the lower extremities (35.3%), the head/face (30.3%) and the upper extremities (24.9%). The median off time after a fracture in German elite male professional soccer in 7.5 Season was 51.1 days (range 0-144). The number of fractures per 100 players per season decreased between 2009 and 2016. There was no significant difference in overall fracture incidence when comparing players at different position (P=0.11). Goalkeepers have a significantly (P<0.02) higher likelihood of suffering hand and finger fractures and they are significantly (P<0.03) less prone of suffering foot fractures, cranial and maxillofacial fractures (P<0.04). compared to outfield players. CONCLUSIONS: This study can confirm that male professional soccer teams experience 1-2 fractures per season in German elite soccer. The incidence of fractures in elite German soccer players decreased between 2009 and 2016. The most fractures occur in the lower extremities and there is no difference in overall fracture risk for players at different playing positions.

It might be expected that UEFA's Financial Fair Play (FFP) system established in 2010 would be similar to French DNCG (National Direction for Management Control) regulations. However, while FFP is concerned with profitability, DNCG is focused on solvency. Hence, a French club may be loss-making and not compliant with FFP, while at the same time being solvent in accordance with DNCG rules. Our research confirms that most French clubs do not conform to FFP rules. As such, it provides further evidence that DNCG has not prevented poor financial management within French clubs. The coexistence of DNCG and FFP- or any other domestic financial regulation and FFP -may result in disparities between domestic clubs. As a consequence, there should be consistent financial regulation in all European leagues.

The present essay argues that Europeanization of the game has to be understood in a long-term perspective. The papers examines the creation and development of three competitions as key defining events, which represented different stages of the Europeanization of the game: Mitropa Cup (created in 1927), European Champion Clubs' Cup (created in 1955) and UEFA Cup (created in 1971). Thus, afocus on these cases can help us better understand the background of the Europeanization of the game which happened during the 1990s.

N.","Functional activity of platelet hemostasis of amateur soccer players aged 26-35, who regularly trained in adolescence","Research Journal of Pharmaceutical, Biological and Chemical Sciences","","0975-8585","","","The state of the human body is largely determined by the rheological properties of blood, which are largely associated with the activity of platelet hemostasis. It is known that platelet functions may vary depending on the conditions of life, incl. on the intensity of the exercise. In young people who regularly engaged in the age of 18-22 years in the football section and subsequently transferred to irregular training, a stable low functional platelet activity was revealed. For 26-35 years, their platelet aggregation was at a low level, without experiencing significant fluctuations. Apparently, this is due to the constancy of their sensitivity to exogenous influences. The optimally low platelet activity causes a small amount of circulating aggregates of various sizes in their bloodstream, which has a stable positive effect on the microcirculation of tissues in the body of a young person who has previously been physically trained regularly.","2019","2020-05-20 00:23:31","2020-05-20 00:23:31","","1426-1430","","1","10","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L627374845","adult; human; article; football; soccer player; exercise; physical activity; young adult; adolescence; hemostasis; microcirculation; thrombocyte aggregation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Hence, this study assesses functional and motor deficits in the aforementioned population and investigates the effects of an individualized training intervention on functional and motor deficits. Methods: This explorative, quasi-experimental study design allocated male soccer players (9-13 years) (n=48) into intervention group (n=23) and control group (n=25). Both groups performed the functional movement screen, toe touch test and weight-bearing lunge test pre-intervention and post-intervention. The intervention group performed a 12-week multimodal training intervention twice per week for 10-15 minutes. The total score of the functional movement screen and the results of the toe touch test and weight-bearing lunge test served as the outcome parameters. Results: We identified a variety of functional and motor defi- cits. All participants improved their total score of the functional movement screen (F(1)=32.27; p<0.001; peta²=0.42), toe touch test (F(1)=10.48; p<0.01; peta²=0.19) and weight-bearing lunge test (F(1)=8.46; p<0.01; peta²=0.16). The intervention group showed higher improvements for the functional movement screen (F(1,46)=4.46; p<0.05; peta²=0.09), toe touch test (F(1,46)=10.48; p<0.01; peta²=0.19) and weight-bearing lunge test (F(1,46)=8.46; p<0.01; peta²=0.16). Conclusion: A 12-week multimodal training intervention can effectively reduce functional and motor deficits identified in male soccer players aged 9-13 years and might serve as a helpful tool in injury prevention. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR Hintergrund und Ziel: Bislang befassten sich nur wenige Studien mit funktionellen und motorischen Defiziten und deren Konsequenzen auf das spätere Verletzungsrisiko bei Fußballspielern im Alter von 9-13 Jahren. Ziel dieser Studie war die Identifikation möglicher motorischer Defizite und die Erprobung einer individualisierten Intervention zur Reduktion erfasster motorischer Defizite Methode: Die explorative, quasi-experimentelle Studie untersuchte männliche Fußballathleten (9-13 Jahre; N=48) mit einer Interventions- (n=23) und einer Kontrollgruppe (n=25). Die Untersuchungen umfassten den Functional Movement Screen Test (FMS), den Toe Touch Test und den Weight-Bearing Lunge Test im Pre-Post-Design. Die Interventionsgruppe absolvierte ein 12-wöchiges individualisiertes Trainingsprogramm zwei Mal pro Woche für 10-15 Minuten. Der Summenscore des FMS sowie die Ergebnisse des Toe Touch Test und Weight-Bearing Lunge Test wurde als Outcome-Parameter analysiert. Ergebnisse: Es konnte eine Vielzahl an motorischen Defiziten identifiziert werden. Alle Fußballer verbesserten den Gesamtscore des FMS (F(1)=32.27; p<0.001; peta²=0.42), Toe Touch Test (F(1)=10.48; p<0.01; peta²=0.19) und Weight-Bearing Lunge Test (F(1)=8.46; p<0.01; peta²=0.16). Die Interventionsgruppe zeigte hierbei höhere Verbesserungen für den FMS (F(1,46)=4.46; p<0.05; peta²=0.09), den Toe Touch Test (F(1,46)=10.48; p<0.01; peta²=0.19) und den Weight-Bearing Lunge Test (F(1,46)=8.46; p<0.01; peta²=0.16). Fazit: Eine 12-wöchige individualisierte Trainingsintervention kann effektiv funktionelle und motorische Defizite bei männlichen Nachwuchsfußballern im Alter von 9-13 Jahren reduzieren und somit ein hilfreiches Instrument zur Verletzungsprophylaxe darstellen.

Descriptive statistics were used to describe the study sample and to conduct bivariate comparisons by race and age cohort. Linear regression models were conducted in the subsample of respondents reporting on depressive symptoms using the PHQ-9. Models examine the relationship of bodily pain, injury as a reason for retirement or not re-signing with a team, length of NFL career, sociodemographic characteristics, chronic conditions, and functional limitations to depression. Interaction terms tested whether race and age moderated the effect of bodily pain and functional limitations on depressive symptoms. Bivariate associations revealed no significant differences between younger and older former players in indicators of pain and only slightly higher functional limitations among younger former players. In the multivariate models, pain was significantly associated with depressive symptoms (β = 0.36; p < .01), net of a range of relevant controls. Adding an index of functional limitations reduced this association by nearly half (β = 0.20; p < .01) and functional limitations was significantly associated with depressive symptoms (β = 0.40; p < .01). No statistically significant interactions were found. Overall, bodily pain was strongly associated with depressive symptoms. After accounting for the effects of functional limitations, this association was notably reduced. These results may be useful in identifying aging-related physical declines in relatively younger adult men who may be at the greatest risk for depression. They highlight how physical functionality and activity may mitigate the risk of depression, even in the presence of significant bodily pain.","2019","2020-05-20 00:23:35","2020-05-20 00:23:35","","1557988319876825","","5","13","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1557988319876825; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629332750","adult; human; male; article; football; injury; controlled study; athlete; race; career; pain; depression; chronic disease; aging; linear regression analysis; Patient Health Questionnaire 9; retirement","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

OBJECTIVES: To present and compare a wide range of functional movement patterns and body composition (BC) parameters of high-level male athletes playing different sports and to determine if there was a relationship between the parameters examined. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Team facilities. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 30 volleyball, 25 soccer, and 30 rugby players (age = 25.9 [5.0] y and body mass index = 25.6 [4.1] kg/m2). INTERVENTIONS: Functional movement patterns and anthropometric measurements were collected by a physician specifically trained. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Body mass index, fat mass, fat-free mass, upper-arm muscle and fat area, calf muscle and fat area, thigh muscle and fat area, and functional movement screen (FMS) scores. In addition to considering the FMS total score, the authors separated the screen into 3 parts: FMSmove, FMSflex, and FMSstab. RESULTS: The rugby players showed a higher number of asymmetrical and dysfunctional movements than the other athletes (P < .01), while the highest scores in FMSflex were obtained by the volleyball players (P < .01). In addition, most of the asymmetrical and painful movements in the athletes were measured on the shoulder mobility test. Muscle and fat areas differed significantly among the athletes (P < .05). Significant associations were found between movement patterns and several BC variables. In particular, large negative correlations were measured between percentage of fat mass (r = -.616; P < .01), upper-arm fat area (r = -.519; P < .01), and FMS total score. CONCLUSIONS: Functional movement patterns and BC differ in athletes according to the sport practiced. Furthermore, reaching an optimal BC is essential to achieve a satisfactory quality of movement.","2019","2020-05-20 00:23:36","2020-05-20 00:23:36","","740-745","","7","28","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1123/jsr.2018-0087; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629225748","adult; human; male; football; soccer; athlete; body mass; young adult; cross-sectional study; exercise test; volleyball; classification; body composition; obesity; movement (physiology)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This cohort study investigates whether the Functional Movement Screen score predicts non-contact injuries in elite adolescent rugby league players. Australian adolescent rugby league players (n = 52; mean age 16.0 ± 1.0 years) from one club participated in this study. Functional Movement Screen scores, height, and mass were collected at the beginning of the preseason. Training, match exposure, and injury incidence data (non-contact match and training injuries with three levels of severity) were recorded for each individual athlete throughout the season. Linear and logistic regression analyses were conducted to investigate the association between Functional Movement Screen score (continuous score, ≤ 14 or > 14, and three subscores) and injury risk, whilst controlling for exposure time. The mean Functional Movement Screen score for the sample was 13.4 (95% CI: 11.0–14.0). A total of 72 non-contact injuries were recorded (incidence rate: 18.7 per 1000 exposure hours; 95% CI: 11.6–24.8). There were no statistically significant associations between non-contact injury and Functional Movement Screen score for any of the analyses conducted. Our results suggest that the Functional Movement Screen does not reflect non-contact injury risk in elite adolescent rugby league players. Further research should investigate whether a more sport-specific movement screen in the preseason can more effectively predict injury risk in this population.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the role of FMS in the process of acquiring soccer-specific motor skills (measured using speed dribbling) with regard to physical fitness and biological maturation. Forty male soccer players (11.5 ± 0.3 years of age) at the highest performance level participated in the study. The test of Gross Motor Development - second edition and Unifittest 6-60 were used to assess FMS and physical fitness, respectively. The role of FMS in a complex theoretical model with the relationships between physical fitness, biological maturation and speed dribbling was analyzed by multiple regression path analyses (MRPA). Moderate to strong correlations were found between FMS, physical fitness, and speed dribbling (r = 0.56-0.66). Biological maturation did not appear to be a significant predictor of physical fitness or speed dribbling. The MRPA model using FMS as mediator variable between physical fitness and speed dribbling showed a significant indirect effect (standard estimation = −0.31, p = 0.001; R2 = 0.25). However, the direct correlation between physical fitness and speed dribbling was non-significant. Our results showed that FMS significantly strengthened the influence of physical fitness on the performance of speed dribbling, a soccer-specific motor skill, and thus play an important role in the process of acquiring sport-specific motor skills in prepubertal soccer players. When considering the long-term training process, especially during childhood and before puberty, a wide range of FMS activities should be applied for better and possibly faster acquisition of soccer-specific motor skills.","2019","2020-05-20 00:23:42","2020-05-20 00:23:42","","","","MAY","10","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2019.00596; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628303656","human; human experiment; male; article; soccer player; controlled study; physical performance; velocity; child; school child; motor performance; normal human; fitness; clinical assessment; correlation coefficient; age distribution; fundamental motor skill; Gross Motor Development second edition; speed dribbling; theoretical model; Unifittest 6 60","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Patients who have undergone anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction surgery may exhibit post-operative lower limb gait disturbances. Design. Laboratory in vivo controlled study. Methods. Kinematics and kinetics parameters of knee motion were measured in post-ACL reconstruction participants (n = 5; m = 4 / f = 1, age 30.6 years, height 179.2 cm, weight 80.4 kg) and control participants (n = 10; m = 6 / f = 4, age 30.3 years, height 173.5 cm, weight 65.3 kg). Kinematics and kinetics were recorded for normal gait, 'cutting' gait and 'weaving' gait (ẋ = 3 per gait type) using instrumented motion analysis and ground embedded force plates. Between groups, differences in knee joint alignment were determined in the frontal plane for normal gait, and in the coronal plane for cutting and weaving. Five of the subjects were recruited for this study had an ACL reconstruction in the past (at least two years before the test), and ten were part of a control group. Each subject performed three different tasks with both legs on a force plate: normal walking, a weaving movement, and a cutting movement. Kinematic and kinetic data were collected with four optoelectronic cameras and two force plates. Comparisons were made in the frontal plane for walking and in the coronal plane for cutting and weaving between the reconstructed knee and the contralateral, healthy knee in the late stance period. Results. There were no significant differences between the ACL reconstructed knees and the contralateral healthy knees in the walking task (p = 0.27 - 0.49). Knee coronal plane rotation showed between group similarity (cutting = 21.82° vs 11.29°, p = 0.175; weaving = 17.88 vs 21.34°, p = 0.406). Conclusions. There is an increased rotation of the knee during walking and cutting in ACL reconstructed knees when compared to the contralateral knee, although this difference was not statistically significant.","2019","2020-05-20 00:23:48","2020-05-20 00:23:48","","62-69","","1","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","","","","https://gateway.library.qut.edu.au/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=c8h&AN=142800996&site=ehost-live&scope=site","Adult; Female; Male; Biomechanics; Football; Human; Descriptive Statistics; Rugby; Athletes; Kinetics; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction -- Adverse Effects; Gait -- Classification; Gait Disorders, Neurologic -- Risk Factors; In Vivo Studies; Kinematics -- Evaluation; Knee Joint -- Physiology; Motion Analysis Systems; Movement; Rotation; Skiing; Surgery, Reconstructive; Task Performance and Analysis; Walking","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this study was therefore to investigate the association of infarct size and myocardial salvage with gender, smoking status, presence of diabetes or history of hypertension in a cohort of STEMI-patients. Methods: Patients (n = 301) with first-time STEMI from the three recent multi-center trials (CHILL-MI, MITOCARE and SOCCER) underwent cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging to determine myocardium at risk (MaR) and infarct size (IS). Myocardial salvage index (MSI) was calculated as MSI = 1-IS/MaR. Pain to balloon time, culprit vessel, trial treatments, age, TIMI grade flow and collateral flow by Rentrop grading were included as explanatory variables in the statistical model. Results: Women (n = 66) had significantly smaller MaR (mean difference: 5.0 ± 1.5% of left ventricle (LV), p < 0.01), smaller IS (mean difference: 5.1 ± 1.4% of LV, p = 0.03), and larger MSI (mean difference: 9.6 ± 2.8% of LV, p < 0.01) compared to men (n = 238). These differences remained significant when adjusting for other explanatory variables. There were no significant effects on MaR, IS or MSI for diabetes, hypertension or smoking. Conclusions: Female gender is associated with higher myocardial salvage and smaller infarct size suggesting a pathophysiological difference in infarct evolution between men and women.","2019","2020-05-20 00:23:50","2020-05-20 00:23:50","","","","1","19","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628388472; http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12872-019-1139-7","adult; female; human; male; article; pathophysiology; priority journal; controlled study; major clinical study; scoring system; cohort analysis; cardiovascular risk; diabetes mellitus; hypertension; middle aged; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; disease association; medical history; smoking; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; sex ratio; cardiac muscle; 2010-024616-33; collateral circulation; heart infarction size; myocardial salvage index; NCT01423929; ST segment elevation myocardial infarction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Focus group interviews explored their sporting experiences with reference to body perceptions, and perceptions of their sporting bodies outside sporting contexts. Three themes resulted from data analysis, these being; (1) UK culture, body performances and femininity, (2) sporting culture, body performances and femininity and (3) transiency of body satisfaction across sport and non-sport contexts. Findings suggest that sport may not always provide an opportunity to challenge and resist dominant discourses. In both netball and soccer, a range of surveillance and management practices were used that served to perpetuate the value of a 'feminine' and assumed heterosexual body, and legitimize their sport participation through an emphasis on a hyper-femininity. The influence of sport subcultures on gendered performances and identity construction, along with implications for marketing sports participation to women are discussed.

It was also aim of this study to compare the variations on the internal load markers (heart rate and perceived exertion) between both training programs. Twenty youth players (age: 18.6 ± 0.5 years old) were randomly assigned to SSG (n = 12) and generic fitness training (GFT) group (n = 8). Each group performed workouts with equal duration and intensities. Participants completed a VO2max treadmill test, the Wingate test and an agility test pre and post training period. Training heart rate and Rate Perceived Exertion (RPE) were used as internal load markers during the training program. There was a significant difference in training load (RPE) between two groups in all types of training but not in the heart rate. Despite significant improvements (p <.05) from pre to post tests in all measured indicators except minimum power, there was no significant changes between groups for agility, anaerobic, and aerobic parameters (p >.05). SSG-based program provided a similar heart rate stimulus on players comparing to GFT program and both programs meaningfully improved the fitness parameters of the young futsal players. Moreover, SSG-based program also resulted in better technical performance, thus representing an effective alternative to generic fitness training for the development of aerobic capacity and anaerobic power in futsal.","2019","2020-05-20 00:23:58","2020-05-20 00:23:58","","347-354","","","204","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2019.03.017; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2001710658","adult; female; human; male; article; aerobic capacity; clinical article; exercise; heart rate; controlled study; season; young adult; juvenile; randomized controlled trial; agility; treadmill test; stimulus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: The authors studied 363 (mean [SD]; 25 [6] y, 89% male) elite players (soccer, futsal, basketball, handball, and roller hockey) from a top-level European team (FC Barcelona, Spain). Of 363, 55% (cases) had experienced 1+ episodes of tendinopathy during 2008-2018 and 45% (controls) remained injury free. The authors first examined the association between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and tendinopathy risk in a hypothesis-free case-control genome-wide association study (495,837 SNPs) with additional target analysis of 58 SNPs that are potential candidates to influence tendinopathy risk based on the literature. Thereafter, the authors augmented the SNP set by performing synthetic variant imputation (1,419,369 SNPs) and then used machine learning-based multivariate modeling (support vector machine and random forest) to build a reliable predictive model. RESULTS: Suggestive association (P < 10-5) was found for rs11154027 (gap junction alpha 1), rs4362400 (vesicle amine transport 1-like), and rs10263021 (contactin-associated protein-like 2). Carriage of 1+ variant alleles for rs11154027 (odds ratio = 2.11; 95% confidence interval, 1.07-4.19, P = 1.01 × 10-6) or rs4362400 (odds ratio = 1.98; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-3.73, P = 9.6 × 10-6) was associated with a higher risk of tendinopathy, whereas an opposite effect was found for rs10263021 (odds ratio = 0.42; 95% confidence interval, 0.20-0.91], P = 4.5 × 10-6). In the modeling approach, one of the most robust SNPs was rs10477683 in the fibrillin 2 gene encoding fibrillin 2, a component of connective tissue microfibrils involved in elastic fiber assembly. CONCLUSIONS: The authors have identified previously undescribed genetic predictors of tendinopathy in elite team sports athletes, notably rs11154027, rs4362400, and rs10263021.","2019","2020-05-20 00:23:59","2020-05-20 00:23:59","","1-7","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1123/ijspp.2019-0431; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629601317","sports medicine; adult; female; human; male; article; soccer; injury; basketball; team sport; physical performance; athlete; prediction; hockey; gene frequency; endogenous compound; clinical evaluation; Spain; single nucleotide polymorphism; amine transport; connexin 43; contactin 1; elastic fiber; fibrillin 2; genetic marker; genetic polymorphism; genetic susceptibility; genome-wide association study; random forest; support vector machine; tendinitis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The majority of athletes with abnormal ECGs do not have a clear cardiomyopathy, but some may develop them at later dates. This may be reflected in LV global longitudinal strain (GLS). Methods: 1,115 athletes with adequate strain quality images from the 2012-15 National Football League combine were analyzed using standard guidelines. GLS were obtained using speckle tracking (GE Vivid Q). ECGs were retrospectively reviewed by 2 cardiologists with expertise in sports cardiology & classified as Normal, Borderline or Abnormal using the IC. Results: There were no significant differences in mean GLS across ECG categories (ANOVA p=0.194). Adjustment using a simple linear regression model including mean age, weight, blood pressure, LV geometry and lineman position had only slight impact (e.g. black, non-lineman of mean age, weight, blood pressure with normal LV geometry, estimated mean GLS 19.4%, 18.4%, 19.8% for normal, borderline, abnormal ECG respectively). Conclusion: IC identifies ECG abnormalities not consistent with athletic adaptation that overlap with pathologic cardiac disorders. Using speckle tracking, there was no significant difference between the broad ECG classes & GLS values. This highlights the need to further study the clinical impact of abnormal ECG findings in athletes utilizing global longitudinal strain.

The sample consisted of 11,446 actions corresponding to 1325 matches from the Spanish Futsal League in the seasons from 2010 to 2015. Binary logistic regression and classification tree multivariate models were used to identify the best predictor variables related to the chance of shooting as a criterion of success. Results from the binomial logistic regression emphasised the success relationships when the teams played at home, against an equally ranked opponent, during balanced matches, and had up to two fouls. When the teams were drawing or losing, the actions of goalkeeper as an outfield player were unsuccessful. The classification tree results identified a greater chance of shooting in balanced matches during the playoffs, and with no more than two fouls. Negative effects were observed during the regular phase and when used by the teams in the final moments of a match. The identified trends will allow futsal coaches to recognise the most suitable situations for achieving success when using an attack with the goalkeeper as an outfield player.

METHODS: Fifty-three professional AF athletes' noncontact soft-tissue and bone-stress lower-body injuries (N = 62) were recorded and sprint workloads were quantified over ~18 mo using GPS. Sprint volume (m) and exposures (n) were determined using 2 methods: absolute (>24.9 km·h-1) and relative (>75%, >80%, >85%, >90%, >95% of maximal velocity). Relationships between threshold methods and injury incidence were assessed using logistic generalized additive models. Incidence-rate ratios (IRR) and model performances' area under the curve (AUC) were reported. RESULTS: Mean ±SD maximal velocity for the group was 31.5 ±1.4, range 28.6-34.9 km.h-1. In comparing relative and absolute thresholds, 75% maximal velocity equated to ~1.5 km·h-1 below the absolute speed threshold, while 80% and 85% maximal velocity were 0.1 km·h-1 and 1.7 km·h-1 above the absolute speed threshold, respectively. Model AUC ranged from 0.48 to 0.61. Very low and very high cumulative sprint loads >80% across a 4-wk period, when measured relatively, resulted in higher IRR (2.54-3.29), than absolute thresholds (1.18-1.58). DISCUSSION: Monitoring sprinting volume relative to an athlete's maximal velocity should be incorporated into athlete-monitoring systems. Specifically, quantifying the distance covered at >80% maximal velocity will ensure greater accuracy in determining sprint workloads and associated injury risk.","2019","2020-05-20 00:24:07","2020-05-20 00:24:07","","1-25","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1123/ijspp.2019-0015; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L627871287","football player; human; article; injury; controlled study; incidence; major clinical study; team sport; workload; monitoring; velocity; soft tissue; intermethod comparison; area under the curve; bone stress","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Submaximal passing applies high stress on the adductor muscles and pubic symphysis and is therefore likely to be connected to the occurrence of groin injuries. Therefore, the purpose of the study was to compare hip joint kinematics and adductor muscle forces of different adolescent age groups during submaximal soccer passing. METHODS: Sixty participants, in four groups, below 12, 15, 16 and 23 years (U12, U15, U16, U23), were analyzed. A Footbonaut, equipped with a 3D motion capture system consisting of 16 cameras, was used to capture kinematic data of short passes. Inverse dynamic analysis was performed to calculate muscle forces of ten passes of each subject. RESULTS: The U15 group showed reduced angular velocities. A rise in hip adductor muscle forces was evident from the youngest group up to the oldest groups. The largest increase (49%) was found between U12 and U15. Lower limb mass was identified as the best predictor for the increasing adductor force. CONCLUSION: The reduced angular velocities of the U15 and the increase in muscle forces between all age groups was attributed to the increasing segment masses and length. This increases the moments of inertia of the leg segments thereby demanding higher forces to accelerate the segments. Most likely, the stress put upon the adductors apophyses increases during adolescence, as tendons are known to adapt slower than muscles, increasing the risk for overuse injuries. Coaches could use lower limb mass as an indicator for fast increases in the force demand to identify players who would benefit from a reduced training volume.","2019","2020-05-20 00:24:08","2020-05-20 00:24:08","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1249/MSS.0000000000002243; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L630493469","female; human; male; article; soccer; hip; controlled study; major clinical study; adolescent; leg; inguinal region; muscle strength; adolescence; groups by age; cumulative trauma disorder; kinematics; stress; tendon; motion analysis system","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In total, 76 talented young football players were analysed over two full competitive seasons. The injury incidence and burden for all non-contact and overuse injuries were recorded. Exposure was calculated as the total number of competitive matches hours played. Somatic maturation was estimated by expressing the current height of each player as a percentage of their predicted adult height (Roche, Tyleshevski, & Rogers, 1983). The period of circa-peak height velocity (PHV) (24.5 injuries per 1000 h) was associated with a significantly higher injury incidence rate and burden compared to pre-PHV (11.5 injuries per 1000 h; RR:2.15, 95%CI:1.37-3.38, P < .001). No significant differences in injury risk between maturity timing groups were observed. The interaction effect between maturity status and maturity timing confirmed there is a risk period circa-PHV, but this was not dependent on maturity timing. The main practical application of this study is that football academies should regularly assess the maturity status of young footballers to identify those players with increased susceptibility to injury. Moreover, academies should individualise training and injury prevention strategies based on maturation.","2019","2020-05-20 00:24:10","2020-05-20 00:24:10","","1-21","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17461391.2019.1633416; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628420394","adult; female; football player; human; male; article; clinical article; controlled study; incidence; team sport; juvenile; height; cumulative trauma disorder; pain; accident prevention; maturity; overexertion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: In Fall 2017, Patient A (20 yrs, Centre Back) underwent patellofemoral realignment and Patient B (21 yrs, Centre Midfielder) underwent ACL reconstruction. Both players were cleared medically to play in the 2018 season and seventy-six sessions were monitored during the season. Modification of total distance (TD) and high-speed running (HSR) quantified by GPS was implemented with the medical staff to manage ongoing injury site symptoms. Training loads were based on absolute and relative values of individual match TD and HSR. TD and HSR (velocity >14.4km/h) were measured in metres (m). Results: Patient A's average match duration was 84±23 minutes (min) and Patient B's average match duration was 90±12min. Overall team match duration was 95±8min. Patient A match loads were TD 8763±3826m and HSR 1039±509m. Patient B match loads were TD 8652±2281m and HSR 981±307m. Team match loads were TD 7431±1430m and HSR 1090±235m. Patient A training loads were TD 5201±1048m and HSR 463±352m; which was 59.3% of TD and 44.5% of HSR match load. Athlete B training loads were TD 4415±1650m and HSR 333±209m, which was 51% of TD and 33.9% of HSD match load. Team training loads were TD 4612±1296m and HSR 474±301m. This was 62% of TD and 43.4% of HSR match load. Conclusion: As a result of implementing a GPS guided load management program, both athletes were available for starter selection for all matches throughout the whole competitive season and were able to play the majority of match duration. Clinical implications: Successful collaboration between the medical and sport science teams can ensure injured player readiness and availability for matches. The prioritisation of drills is paramount for ensuring that players are maximising training potential despite being restricted to lower loads compared to the team.

Studies comparing GM composition of professional athletes with their sedentary counterparts have demonstrated the positive impact of exercise and diet on gut microbial diversity and health indicators. Nutritional intake such as Mediterranean Diet (MD) consumption, has been shown to shape GM which might be crucial for promoting overall health and sports performance. Interestingly, the optimisation of GM is suggested to be a potential tool to achieve athletes' health and to positively affect athletic performance. The aim of this study was to explore changes in GM profile of elite athletes before and after the sport season. The impact of a MD-based nutritional intervention for three weeks was also analysed on athletes' GM and anthropometric parameters. Methods: Faecal samples of twenty soccer players were obtained (OMNIgene GUT kit) at the beginning and at the end of the sport season and the three week-dietary intervention based on a MD enriched in pre- and probiotics containing foods. DNA was extracted following specifications of DNeasy PowerSoil kit and PCR amplification of 16S rRNA (V3-V4) was carried out following Illumina protocol for 16S Metagenomic Sequencing Library Preparation. Data were analysed applying different algorithms (RapidMiner software). Statistical differences were identified with Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Results: Athletes showed significant variations on total bacterial content and specific bacterial taxa (i.e. Proteobacteria) at the beginning and at the end of the sport season. A statistically significant increase was observed in the skinfold sum after the nutritional intervention. Dietary modifications exert a significant effect on athletes' GM profile (i.e. Methanomicrobiales euryarchaeota, several genus and bacterial species). Conclusions: Exercise and MD intake might influence GM profile. These changes might be related to health indicators in professional soccer players.","2019","2020-05-20 00:24:12","2020-05-20 00:24:12","","196-197","","","23","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629427763","conference abstract; human; elite athlete; soccer player; controlled study; season; athletic performance; polymerase chain reaction; endogenous compound; nonhuman; diet therapy; software; algorithm; skinfold; Wilcoxon signed ranks test; anthropometric parameters; feces; intestine flora; Mediterranean diet; metagenomics; Methanomicrobiales; probiotic agent; Proteobacteria; RNA 16S","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Nineteen elite youth soccer players took part in this study and were randomly assigned into two subgroups. For 6 weeks in-season, groups performed either a low (1 set per exercise; 10 reps in total) or a high (4 sets; 40 reps) volume eccentric training of their knee flexors. After 6 weeks (MID), players cross-overed and performed the alternate training regimen. Each training set consisted in 4 repetitions of the Nordic hamstring exercise and 6 repetitions of the bilateral stiff-leg deadlift. Eccentric knee-flexor strength (Nordbord) as well as biceps femoris long head (BFlh) and semimembranosus (SM) fascicle length (scanned with ultrasound scanner) were assessed during PRE, MID- and POST-training tests. RESULTS: Knee-flexor eccentric strength very likely increased from PRE to MID (+11.3±7.8% [low-volume] and 11.4±5.3% [high-volume]), with a possibly-to-likely increase in BFlh (+4.5±5.0% and 4.8±2.5%) and SM (+4.3±4.7% and 6.3±6.3%) fascicle length in both groups. There was no substantial changes between MID and POST. Overall, there was no clear between-group difference in the changes from PRE to MID and MID to POST for neither knee-flexor eccentric strength, BFlH nor SM fascicle length. CONCLUSION: Low-volume knee-flexor eccentric training is as effective as a greater training dose to substantially improve knee-flexor strength and fascicle length in-season in young elite soccer players. Low-volume is however likely more appropriate to be used in an elite team facing congested schedules.","2019","2020-05-20 00:24:13","2020-05-20 00:24:13","","1-27","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1123/ijspp.2018-0947; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L627625168","human; article; soccer player; knee; exercise; controlled study; season; juvenile; randomized controlled trial; head; biceps femoris muscle; ultrasound scanner","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This symposium aims to synthesise the latest research, providing strategies informed by evidence for hamstring strain injury prevention, rehabilitation and sports performance. Dr David Opar will provide an update on current attempts to identify risk factors and prevent hamstring strain injuries. Dr Ryan Timmins will address the hotly debated Nordic hamstring exercise and discuss alternative interventions to address hamstring strain injury risk factors. Dr Fearghal Behan will provide insight into the risk factor and performance adaptations in response to training interventions of different volume and frequency. Ms Kate Beerworth will then present on hamstring strain injuries within elite women's football and the importance of clinical assessment to inform rehabilitation. Dr Jack Hickey will discuss exercise-specific approaches to individualise rehabilitation progression and enhance adaptation following hamstring strain injury. Finally, Mr Scott Hulm will discuss the importance of preparing the injured athlete for returning to sports performance with a focus on sprinting in a high-performance environment.","2019","2020-05-20 00:24:14","2020-05-20 00:24:14","","S8","","","22","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsams.2019.08.049; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002901902","sports medicine; adult; conference abstract; female; human; football; hamstring muscle; controlled study; competition; athlete; athletic performance; risk factor; clinical assessment; accident prevention; prevention","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They perform in dynamical contexts and are highly submitted to time pressure. The purpose of this naturalistic case study, therefore, was to explore how a handball expert goalkeeper deals with the uncertainty of the competition settings to make successful decisions. An individual self-confrontation interview was held with a goalkeeper while he watched duels with potential throwers in an official competition. A mixed method was used combining the first-person and third-person point of view. Verbal data were supplemented by observational data (distance measures between the goalkeeper and the potential thrower) in 83 short accounts of decision-making situations. Qualitative analysis resulted in 419 units of salient features, in three types of processes related to the Recognition-Primed Decision model, and in four micro-decisions. Non-parametrical statistical analysis indicated that there was a significant effect of distances between the potential thrower and the goalkeeper, on the micro-decision categories, but not on the recognition processes. These results provide insights into cognitive contents and processes an expert goalkeeper can use under uncertainty and time pressure. The mixed method furnishes a meaningful description and a subsequent understanding of expert performances in sport.

Data were obtained for the 2012/13-2015/16 school years from the National High School Sports-Related Injury Surveillance System, High School RIO™. This Internet-based sports injury surveillance system captures data reported by athletic trainers from an annual average of 162 U.S. high schools. Data were analyzed to describe circumstances of soccer concussion (e.g., symptomology, symptom resolution, and return-to-play time) by impact location (i.e., front- [face included], back-, side-, and top-of-the-head) and sex. Most concussions were from front-of-the-head impacts (boys, 30.5%; girls, 34.0%). Overall, 4.1 ± 2.2 and 4.6 ± 2.3 symptoms were reported in boys and girls, respectively. In boys, symptom frequency was not associated with head impact location (p = 0.66); an association was found in girls (p = 0.02), with the highest symptom frequency reported in top-of-the-head impacts (5.4 ± 2.2). Head impact location was not associated with symptom resolution time (boys, p = 0.21; girls, p = 0.19) or return-to-play time (boys, p = 0.18; girls, p = 0.07). Heading was associated with 28.0% and 26.5% of concussions in boys and girls, respectively. Most player-player contact concussions during heading occurred from side-of-the-head impacts (boys, 49.4%; girls, 43.2%); most heading-related ball contact concussions occurred from front-of-the-head (boys, 41.4%; girls, 42.6%) and top-of-the-head (boys, 34.5%; girls, 36.9%) impacts. Head impact location was generally independent of symptom resolution time, return-to-play time, and recurrence among high school soccer concussions. However, impact location may be associated with reported symptom frequency. Further, many of these clinical concussion descriptors were associated with sex.","2019","2020-05-20 00:24:17","2020-05-20 00:24:17","","2073-2082","","13","36","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2017.5319; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628358499","female; human; male; article; soccer; brain concussion; controlled study; incidence; return to sport; high school; sex difference; child; school child; United States; recurrence risk; contact sport; clinical feature; clinical outcome; injury severity; sports science; athletic trainer; disease surveillance; head movement; body regions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Method: This observational study recruited thirty-six female soccer players (13.4 ± 0.9 years old) from three elite youth soccer teams (U13, U14, U15) and followed for an entire soccer season. Players wore wireless sensors during each game to quantify head impact magnitudes. A total of 60 regular season games (20 games per team) were video recorded, and purposeful heading events were categorized by game scenario (e.g. throw in), and head impact location (e.g. front of head). Results: Game scenario had a statistically significant effect on the linear head acceleration, and rotational head velocity, that resulted from purposeful headers. Rotational velocity from purposeful headers varied significantly between head impact locations, with impacts to the top of the head (improper technique) resulting in larger peak rotational velocities than impacts to the front of the head (proper technique); this was also the case for the linear acceleration for punts. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that the magnitude for both linear and angular head impact kinematics depend on the game scenario and head impact location. Headers performed with the top of the head (improper technique) result in larger rotational velocities compared to the front of the head (proper technique). Accordingly, youth players should be educated on how to execute proper heading technique to reduce head impact accelerations.","2019","2020-05-20 00:24:18","2020-05-20 00:24:18","","53-57","","","40","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.msksp.2019.01.009; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2001511425","female; human; article; soccer; biomechanics; observational study; priority journal; performance; adolescent; deceleration; velocity; head injury; injury severity; descriptive research; mechanical stress; GForce Tracker; portable equipment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In 2006 a rule was changed to reduce head injuries. Players were given a red card (sent off) for intentional elbow-head contact. AIMS: To describe the head injury mechanism and examine the effect of the rule change. METHODS: Based on continuously recorded data from the German football magazine ""kicker"", a database of all head injuries in the 1st German Male Bundesliga was generated comprising seasons 2000/01-2012/13. Injury mechanisms were analysed from video recordings. Injury incidence rates (IR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) as well as incidence rate ratios (IRR) to assess differences before and after the rule change were calculated. RESULTS: 356 head injuries were recorded (IR 2.22, 95% CI 2.00 to 2.46 per 1000 match hours). Contact with another player caused most head injuries, more specifically because of head-head (34%) or elbow-head (17%) contacts. After the rule change, head injuries were reduced by 29% (IRR 0.71, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.86, p=0.002). Lacerations/abrasions declined by 42% (95% CI 0.39 to 0.85), concussions by 29% (95% CI 0.46 to 1.09), contusions by 18% (95% CI 0.43 to 1.55) and facial fractures by 16% (95% CI 0.55 to 1.28).

Mild TBI is caused by blunt nonpenetrating head trauma that causes movement of the brain and stretching and tearing of axons, with diffuse axonal injury being a central pathogenic mechanism. Mild TBI is in principle synonymous with concussion; both have similar criteria in which the most important elements are acute alteration or loss of consciousness and/or post-traumatic amnesia following head trauma and no apparent brain changes on standard neuroimaging. Symptoms in mild TBI are highly variable and there are no validated imaging or fluid biomarkers to determine whether or not a patient with a normal computerized tomography scan of the brain has neuronal damage. Mild TBI typically resolves within a few weeks but 10–15% of concussion patients develop postconcussive syndrome. Repetitive mild TBI, which is frequent in contact sports, is a risk factor for a complicated recovery process. This overview paper discusses the relationships between repetitive head impacts in contact sports, mild TBI and chronic neurological symptoms. What are these conditions, how common are they, how are they linked and can they be objectified using imaging or fluid-based biomarkers? It gives an update on the current state of research on these questions with a specific focus on clinical characteristics, epidemiology and biomarkers.","2019","2020-05-20 00:24:21","2020-05-20 00:24:21","","624-634","","6","285","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/joim.12863; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L625589086","human; sport injury; priority journal; head injury; neurologic disease; traumatic brain injury; biological marker; chronic disease; contact sport; functional magnetic resonance imaging; tau protein; review; positron emission tomography; amyloid; functional neuroimaging; metabolomics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Headaches have been shown to occur frequently in adolescent athletes, and headaches are also a common symptom following sports concussions. Despite this, very few studies have been undertaken on headache presentation in high-school rugby union players. This investigation aimed to document the prevalence of headache in high-school rugby union players and investigate the association between current headaches and concussion history. Methods: This cross-sectional study evaluated the prevalence of headache in 247 high-school student rugby union players from three Associated Independent Colleges and three Greater Public Schools in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. Players in the school's senior playing squad or emerging playing squad at the beginning of the 2016 and 2017 school rugby season completed a self-report headache and concussion questionnaire. The relationship between the number of previous concussions and headache status was investigated using the score test of trend of odds. Results: A total of 22.3 % (55) of participants reported experiencing current headaches. Overall, 46.1 % (114) of players reported a history of concussion. Of these, 46.5 % (53) reported one previous concussion, 25.4 % (29) reported two previous concussions, 12.3 % (14) reported three previous concussions, and 15.7 % (18) reported 4 or more previous concussions. Of the players who reported a history of concussion, 26.5 % (30) had current headaches. As the number of previous concussions increased, the odds of reporting a current headache increased significantly (p = 0.033). Discussion: This study provides insight into the relationship between concussion history and current headache status in high-school rugby union players. There is increasing evidence of the adverse effects of multiple concussions on post-concussive symptom presentation and recovery times. Subsequent concussions after a first injury are very common and repeated concussions are often sustained within a short period of time. Without a more complete understanding of the relationship between concussion history and headache presentation, management of headaches in the adolescent athlete remains challenging. Future work is needed to examine the short and long-term effects of multiple concussions on headache presentation in adolescent rugby union players.","2019","2020-05-20 00:24:22","2020-05-20 00:24:22","","S106","","","22","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsams.2019.08.143; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002901969","conference abstract; female; human; male; rugby; controlled study; major clinical study; season; adolescent; athlete; questionnaire; cross-sectional study; prevalence; Queensland; self report; high school student; headache; postconcussion syndrome","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DESIGN: Prospective cohort. SETTING: Scholastic football fields. PATIENTS: Two thousand five hundred fourteen scholastic football players during the 2015 to 2016 football season were monitored throughout the football season. INTERVENTIONS: Before the preseason, 1 coach from 14 schools received HU training from US football. These schools were matched with 10 control schools performing standard football training [non-heads up (NHU)]. Random monitoring for proper coaching instruction was performed during the season. School athletic trainers monitored injuries and return to sport over the season for all schools. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The outcome measures of concussions and associated time loss were determined before data collection began. Injury incidence and rate ratios were calculated to determine program effectiveness. RESULTS: During the season, football players sustained 117 concussions (HU = 75; NHU = 42). The HU players displayed a significantly lower concussion rate (4.1 vs 6.0/100 players) compared with NHU teams [rate ratio = 1.5; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.1-5.4]. The HU group returned to full participation 27% faster than athletes in the NHU group [time loss: 18.2 days (95% CI, 15.8-20.6) vs 24.8 days (95% CI, 19.9-29.7)], respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to evaluate the impact of the HU program on the incidence of SRC in high school football players. Our data demonstrated that the HU program reduced SRC rates by 33% supporting the use of US HU football training as an effective method to decrease the rate of SRCs in scholastic football.

Illness/injury data was collected by Red Cross volunteers. Results: Heat injuries were quantified and correlated to apparent temperature, date of the game and location within the stadium. The majority of heat injury occurred in the first 3 games, withanoted maximum apparent temperatureof122.5 and average apparent temperature of 98. The recorded high ambient temperature for each game 88. Average game attendance was 94 521 and the average number of heat injuries in the first 3 games was 35. Further analysis of heat injury and apparent temperature will be available upon presentation. Conclusions: Unsurprisingly, significantly more heat injury was found to occur among spectators during the late summer/early fall games. Our most interesting finding was the difference in apparent temperature by wet bulb globe compared to the ambient temperature. We plan to use this data to establish emergency action plans and advocate with the athletic department to educate spectators and mitigate risk of heat injury, especially in early season games. Significance: Heat-related injury will likely rise as societal and environmental factors contributing to heat injury continue to increase. Further study, analysis and quantification of heat injury will lead to better understanding and management.","2019","2020-05-20 00:24:27","2020-05-20 00:24:27","","105","","2","29","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/JSM.0000000000000724; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629860225","adult; conference abstract; human; football; humidity; controlled study; summer; environmental temperature; heat injury; army; environmental factor; Red Cross; Tennessee","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While, providing access to live broadcast of European soccer competitions, SVCs have developed into supplementary social spaces where culturally defined rules of social relations are contested. Using Goffman's notion of performance and Agbalagba in Yoruba normative system, in conjunction with sociological perspective on space, the study explores the context and processes in the transformation of age social relations in Ibadan, South-Western Nigeria. Data were obtained through participant observation, and 23 in-depth interviews with viewing centre owners and soccer fans. Findings depict the SVC as a constructed space, with conflicting meanings, attitudes and practices, which inadvertently fracture and render fluid, the expectations of norms of age social relations. In conclusion, European soccer drives the spread of supplementary social spaces which impact local social structures in critical ways.

However, the ability of partial league standings to predict end-of-season position has largely been ignored. Here we analyze historical partial standings from English soccer to understand the mathematics underpinning league performance and evaluate the predictive 'power' of partial standings. Methods Match data (1995-2017) from the four senior English leagues was analyzed, together with random match scores generated for hypothetical leagues of equivalent size. For each season the partial standings were computed and Kendall's normalized tau-distance and Spearman r-values determined. Best-fit power-law and logarithmic functions were applied to the respective tau-distance and Spearman curves, with the 'goodness-of-fit' assessed using the R2 value. The predictive ability of the partial standings was evaluated by computing the transition probabilities between the standings at rounds 10, 20 and 30 and the final end-ofseason standings for the 22 seasons. The impact of reordering match fixtures was also evaluated. Results All four English leagues behaved similarly, irrespective of the teams involved, with the taudistance conforming closely to a power law (R2>0.80) and the Spearman r-value obeying a logarithmic function (R2>0.87). The randomized leagues also conformed to a power-law, but had a different shape. In the English leagues, team position relative to end-of-season standing became 'fixed' much earlier in the season than was the case with the randomized leagues. In the Premier League, 76.9% of the variance in the final standings was explained by round-10, 87.0% by round-20, and 93.9% by round-30. Reordering of match fixtures appeared to alter the shape of the tau-distance curves. Conclusions All soccer leagues appear to conform to mathematical laws, which constrain the league standings as the season progresses. This means that partial standings can be used to predict end-of-season league position with reasonable accuracy.","2019","2020-05-20 00:24:31","2020-05-20 00:24:31","","","","12","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0225696; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2004319458","article; soccer; controlled study; season; randomized controlled trial; probability; mathematics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Of all injuries common to collision sports, concussions have received the most attention due to the potentially negative cognitive effects in the short- and long-term. Despite non-professional Rugby players comprising the majority of the world’s playing population, there is relatively little research in this population. Stellenbosch Rugby Football Club (“Maties”), the official rugby club of Stellenbosch University, represents one of the world’s largest non-professional Rugby clubs, making this an ideal cohort for community-level injury surveillance. The aim of this study was to describe the incidence and events associated with concussion in this cohort. Baseline demographics were obtained on the 807 male student Rugby non-professional players who registered for the 10-week long 2018 season, which comprised 101 matches and 2,915 of exposure hours. All match-related injuries were captured by the medical staff of Stellenbosch Campus Health Service on an electronic form developed from the consensus statement for injury recording in Rugby. The mean age, height and weight of this cohort were 20 ± 2 years, 182 ± 7 cm and 88 ± 14 kg, respectively. Overall, there were 89 time-loss injuries, which equated to an injury rate of 30.6 per 1,000 match hours [95% confidence intervals (CIs): 24.2–36.9], or about one injury per match. The most common injury diagnosis was “concussion” (n = 27 out of 90 injuries, 30%), at a rate of 9.3 per 1,000 match hours (95% CIs: 5.8–12.8). The three most common mechanisms of concussion in the present study were performing a tackle (33%), accidental collision (30%) and being tackled (11%). Concussion was the most common injury in this population, at a rate that was six times higher than the most comparable study from the UK, which had far more exposure time over six seasons and wider range of player ability, from recreational to semi-professional. This might be explained by the training and vigilance of the club’s first aiders observing all matches for concussion. Future studies should try to explain this high rate and subsequently reduce these concussions. The addition of video surveillance data would assist in identifying the etiology of these concussions injuries in order to develop specific targeted interventions.","2019","2020-05-20 00:24:33","2020-05-20 00:24:33","","","","","13","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00423; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L630230850","adult; human; male; article; rugby; incidence; sport; cohort analysis; concussion; young adult; head injury; rugby union; knee injury; tackle; disease association; shoulder injury; accident; exposure; ball sports athlete; ankle injury; student; shoulder dislocation; subluxation; hand injury; United Kingdom; accidental collision; shoulder subluxation; sprain","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: The study group was formed by 104 male professional football players who were interviewed to evaluate the incidence of hip and knee arthroplasty. The data were collected through a questionnaire and the results collected were compared with a control group of 100 volunteers matched for age, weight and height, who did not present orthopedic diseases but had never practiced sport. RESULTS: In the study group, 26 subjects (25%) underwent hip and knee arthroplasty at an average mean age of 62.1±6 years. The frequency of arthroplasty was: 13.5% for the hip, 5.8% for the knee and 5.8% for both hip and knee. In the control group, the incidence of arthroplasty was 1% for the knee and no subjects presented hip arthroplasty. CONCLUSIONS: Italian male, former professional football players present a higher than normal incidence of hip and knee arthroplasty. Further studies are necessary to understand the pathological pathways underlying the etiology of hip and knee osteoarthritis in male populations of former professional football players in order to develop effective preventive programs to reduce the percentage of arthroplasties.","2019","2020-05-20 00:24:34","2020-05-20 00:24:34","","1558-1563","","9","59","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629583867; http://dx.doi.org/10.23736/S0022-4707.18.08962-4","human; male; soccer; injury; incidence; questionnaire; retrospective study; middle aged; case control study; aged; hip osteoarthritis; hip replacement; knee osteoarthritis; knee replacement","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design: Prospective controlled trial, conducted between August and November 2016 at Erasmus Medical Centre, The Netherlands. Methods: Pre-professional football players (aged 14–21 years) were evaluated at baseline and after 12 weeks follow-up with the field-based DVJT. The field-based DVJT is a standardised test in which a player drops from a box and jumps up immediately after landing; knee load is calculated based on five parameters. Players with high knee load (probability ≥ 0.75) from one club performed regular training(control group), and players with high knee load from another other club performed targeted neuromuscular exercises for 12 weeks (intervention group). The difference of change in knee load between both groups after 12 weeks was the primary outcome measure. Results: Of 107 eligible players, 75 had a high knee loading. Knee loading decreased in both groups after 12 weeks of training, but change in probability of high knee load was not significantly different between both groups (95% Confidence Interval [−0.012–0.082], p = 0.139). Conclusion: Targeted neuromuscular exercises had no additional effect in decreasing knee loading of adolescent male pre-professional football players compared to regular training.

Moreover, as they may have an educational role for delivering preventive message, referees knowledge on healthy behaviour, including tobacco consumption, is of great concern. Methods: In 2017, an anonymous questionnaire through an electronic link on tobacco smoking and vaping habits was sent to all the French Rugby Federation referees covering the Burgundy region. Among the 84 regional referees, 71 (85%) filled in the questionnaire and were included in the analysis. Results: All referees were male, and 46% were >35 y old. Almost half (44%) were also player (37%) or coach (24%). Surprisingly, the smoking prevalence was quite high (32%), half smokers were heavy daily (>16 cig/d) and 30% were long-lasting (>11y) smokers. Although a minority of referees has smoked <2 h before training or playing a match, most uses cigarettes often or systematically <2 h after rugby session (i.e. after training (56%) or playing a match (60%)). There was also a high prevalence of vaping, as 24% were current e-cigarettes users. In contrast to classic cigarette pattern, vaping was never used before or after rugby session. Alternative kinds of nicotine consumption (mainly chicha or cigar) were rare (4%) and no referees took snus. Although smoking was perceived as dangerous for health for the majority of referees (93%), a substantial rate (33%) was unaware of the harmful effects of tobacco consumption in rugby sessions. Conclusion: Our works, in a representative sample of referees at regional scale, highlight a high prevalence of tobacco smoking, in particular after a rugby session, and vaping. Targeting referees to health information could reduce their CV risk and, as a high-rate of them are also coaches, amplify the preventive effect of such programs.","2019","2020-05-20 00:24:37","2020-05-20 00:24:37","","100","","1","11","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.acvdsp.2018.10.221; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2001348258","adult; conference abstract; human; male; rugby; controlled study; questionnaire; prevalence; cardiovascular risk; nicotine; snus; habit; cigar; medical information; tobacco consumption; vaping","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

PURPOSE: This practice-driven investigation of media-derived ACL data provides information about professional football over 10 years. METHOD: Injury registration was based on ""kicker"" sports magazine information that have been recorded over one decade in a standardized manner. Only ACL ruptures in the first German football league were included when they could be verified by a second reliable source. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III Results: Fifty-seven primary ACL ruptures were verified in the first German football league during the seasons 2007/08 to 2016/17. Among them, 6 re-injuries were found. Mean age at the time of injury was 24.8 years (SD 3.8). 31% (n = 20) of ACL ruptures occurred at the beginning of the season in August or September (p = 0.02). Mean time of RTC after primary ACL ruptures was 226.7 days (SD: 93.5) and 245.6 days (SD: 45.4) after re-injury. Although 62 (98%) players returned to football after injury and only one player immediately finished his career, 54.9% of the affected individuals played 3 years after the ACL rupture in the same league. CONCLUSIONS: ACL ruptures lead to longer absence than 7 months from football but does not give reason for immediate career-ending. The decrease in playing level after 3 years illustrate the serious consequences of ACL ruptures in football. Media-based injury reports may provide interesting information.","2019","2020-05-20 00:24:39","2020-05-20 00:24:39","","1-15","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17461391.2019.1648557; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628942357","adult; human; male; article; football; clinical article; controlled study; season; competition; young adult; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; career","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Reports initial injury 2 weeks prior when he was tackled onto turf landing on the lateral aspect of R shoulder. ATC noted AC joint pain during initial evaluation but cleared for sport. At the game on the following Friday, athlete took a hit from helmet to R scapular area and was later driven to the turf on his left. He experienced persistent pain in R posterior shoulder and bilateral AC joints. Seen at urgent care the following day and x-rays of shoulders were obtained. He now presents on Monday for evaluation. Patient is a two-sport athlete and participates in both football and wrestling with hopes to wrestle in the upcoming season. He has no significant comorbidities or past medical history. Physical Exam: General Appearance: NAD, conversant MSK: Right shoulder-No gross deformity, swelling or asymmetry. Full ROM but pain over 90 degrees mostly in the posterior shoulder. Tender over the medial scapular border and AC joint. Pain elicited with Scarf test, O'Brien's test and Speeds test. No instability. 5/5 strength but pain with all motion. Left Shoulder - No gross deformity swelling or asymmetry. Full ROM but pain over 90 degrees - mostly at the AC joint. Tender over AC joint. Pain elicited with Scarf test, O'Brien's test and Speeds test. No instability. 5/5 strength but all motion painful. Differential Diagnosis: Acromioclavicular joint separation Clavicle fracture Humerus fracture First rib fracture Rotator cuff injury Test Results: Xray L and R Shoulders: No calcifications in rotator cuffs. Glenohumeral joints and AC joints intact b/l. Oblique lucency over R first rib and R medial clavicle might represent nondisplaced fracture. No PTX. Scapula and humerus intact b/l. CT w/out contrast (3D rendering): L-sided ribs, L clavicle and humeral tuberosities intact. No HillSachs or bony Bankart. Soft tissue swelling in subq fat overlying L acromial process and AC joint. Comminuted, nondisplaced fracture through R first rib. Final Diagnosis: Nondisplaced first rib fracture. No evidence of shoulder pathology. Soft tissue swelling at L AC joint without malalignment or fracture indicating grade 1 AC dissociation. Discussion: First rib fractures are generally seen on radiographs and must not be overlooked. They can occur in isolation or in association with other rib fractures. The first rib is protected by the shoulder girdle and musculature, making fractures resulting from external trauma rare. Pain is typically under the scapula or at the clavicle and exacerbated by abduction greater than 90 degrees - this can make diagnosis difficult as it suggests shoulder pathology. Patients may also present with chest wall, neck or pleuritic pain and, rarely, weakness of the ipsilateral extremity with accompanying paresthesia. Possible complications include PTX, Horner's syndrome and thoracic outlet syndrome. Outcome: Athlete informed of first rib fracture and AC dissociation based on imaging results. For first rib fractures without any complications, treatment is mild analgesia and holding from activity until symptoms resolve. Recommended formal physical therapy regiment, as well as ibuprofen and ice for analgesia. Follow-up: Duration of rest period depends on function, not time, with return to sport when asymptomatic. Rarely, nonunion with persistent symptoms occurs, requiring surgical consult. Athlete currently in wrestling preseason and being held from both contact and conditioning. Physical therapy to improve RC strength, minimize shoulder pain and improve ROM. Follow-up with sports medicine physician in 1 month.","2019","2020-05-20 00:24:42","2020-05-20 00:24:42","","e28-e29","","2","29","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/JSM.0000000000000728; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629860333","sports medicine; conference abstract; human; male; football; rib fracture; controlled study; season; return to sport; adolescent; athlete; helmet; follow up; high school; motion; velocity; abduction; physiotherapy; physician; physical examination; soft tissue; complication; thorax wall; medical history; endogenous compound; wrestling; paresthesia; X ray film; differential diagnosis; weakness; comorbidity; clavicle fracture; dissociation; neck; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; shoulder pain; deformity; acromioclavicular joint; analgesia; arthralgia; calcification; first rib; Horner syndrome; humerus fracture; ibuprofen; rotator cuff injury; scapula; swelling; thorax outlet syndrome","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We investigated the activity of ectonucleotidases in platelets and lymphocytes as well as the platelet aggregation of futsal players in response to an acute protocol of HIIE. Thus, 19 male semi-professional futsal players were submitted to 40 min of HIIE on a treadmill. Blood samples were collected three-time points: before exercise, immediately after, and 30 min after the end of the session. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and lymphocytes were isolated. ATP, ADP, AMP, and adenosine hydrolysis, NTPDase1 (CD39) expression as well as platelet aggregation were measured. Our results showed HIIE induced a decrease in ATP and ADP hydrolysis in platelets, an increase in adenosine hydrolysis and an increase in platelet aggregation immediately after exercise. After 30 min of recovery, enzymatic activity and platelet aggregation returned to baseline levels. In lymphocytes, adenosine hydrolysis was augmented immediately after exercise and remained increased even after 30 min of recovery. In conclusion, acute HIIE triggers a transient proaggregant status that is reverted after a 30 min of recovery. The effects of HIIE in lymphocytes remained after 30 min of recovery, indicating a pro-inflammatory response.

However, the noncontextual nature of standard assessments presents challenges for assessing sport-relevant skill transfer. Objective: To examine injury-risk biomechanical differences exhibited by athletes during a jump-landing task performed as part of both a standard biomechanical assessment and a simulated, sport-specific virtual reality (VR)-based assessment. Design: Observational study. Setting: Medical center laboratory. Participants: Twenty-two female adolescent soccer athletes (age = 16.0 [1.4] y, height = 165.6 [4.9] cm, and weight = 60.2 [11.4] kg). Interventions: The landing performance was analyzed for a drop vertical jump task and a VR-based, soccer-specific corner-kick scenario in which the athletes were required to jump to head a virtual soccer ball and land. Main Outcome Measures: Hip, knee, and ankle joint kinematic differences in the frontal and sagittal planes. Results: Athletes exhibited reduced hip and ankle flexion, hip abduction, and frontal plane ankle excursion during landing in realistic sport scenario compared with the standard drop vertical jump task. Conclusion: VR-based assessments can provide a sport-specific context in which to assess biomechanical deficits that predispose athletes for lower-extremity injury and offer a promising approach to better evaluate skill transfer to sport that can guide future injury prevention efforts.","2019","2020-05-20 00:24:45","2020-05-20 00:24:45","","1-7","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1123/jsr.2018-0237; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628328490","female; human; article; soccer; hip; knee; biomechanics; clinical article; observational study; controlled study; adolescent; athlete; outcome assessment; height; abduction; ankle; accident prevention; skill; simulation; leg injury; head; virtual reality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

RESULTS: A qualitative study targeting Zimbabwean high school-based rugby coaches purposively-recruited during the 2017 Dairiboard Zimbabwe Rugby School Festival was conducted. Using the conventional approach to content analysis, the 22 recruited male coaches (median age = 45.5 years) felt that playing rugby is a choice largely influenced by either intrinsic or extrinsic motives for schoolboys. Additionally, coaches considered players' characteristics (performance during training, attitude, physical qualities and skills) and match-related factors when selecting schoolboys for possible inclusion in school rugby teams. To effectively promote competitive rugby participation among schoolboys and promote sustainable and effective talent identification programmes in Zimbabwe, more recognition should be paid to factors motivating schoolboys to participate in rugby and also on the factors coaches consider when assembling school rugby teams which indirectly informs on what coaches think should be trained among schoolboy rugby players.","2019","2020-05-20 00:24:46","2020-05-20 00:24:46","","103","","1","12","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L626574985; http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13104-019-4138-y","adult; human; male; football; adolescent; teacher; middle aged; motivation; mentoring; school; Zimbabwe; student; adolescent behavior","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

AIM: To investigate hip and groin injury rates, especially time-trends, in men's professional football over 15 consecutive seasons. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Men's professional football. METHODS: 47 European teams were followed prospectively for a varying number of seasons between 2001/2002 and 2015/2016, totalling 268 team seasons. Time-loss injuries and individual player exposure during training and matches were recorded. Injury rate was defined as the number of injuries/1000 hours and injury burden as the number of lay-off days/1000 hours. Time-trends for total hip and groin injuries and adductor-related injury rates were analysed using Poisson regression, and injury burden was analysed using a negative binomial regression model. RESULTS: Hip and groin injuries contributed 1812 out of 12 736 injuries (14%), with adductor-related injury as the most common of hip and groin injuries (n=1139, 63%). The rates of hip and groin injury and adductor-related injury were 1.0/1000 hours and 0.6/1000 hours, and these rates decreased significantly with on average 2% (Exp(b)=0.98, 95% CI 0.97 to 0.99, P=0.003) and 3% (Exp(b)=0.97, 95% CI 0.95 to 0.99, P<0.001) per season (year on year), respectively. The seasonal trend of hip and groin injury burden did not improve (Exp(b)=0.99, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.01, P=0.40). CONCLUSIONS: Hip and groin injuries constitute a considerable part of all time-loss injuries in men's professional football. Although there was a promising slight decreasing trend in the rates of hip and groin injury (as a category) and adductor-related injury (as a specific diagnosis), the injury burden remained at a consistent level over the study period.","2019","2020-05-20 00:24:48","2020-05-20 00:24:48","","539-546","","9","53","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bjsports-2017-097796; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L627364931","human; male; soccer; sport injury; prospective study; injuries; inguinal region; leg injury; abdominal injury; occupational accident","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A consensus statement during the Doha Agreement has defined 3 types of groin pain: defined clinical entities for groin pain, hip-related groin pain (femoroacetabular impingement, chondral, or labral tears) and other causes (such as anterior inferior iliac spine, ischial pathology). Clinical entities for groin pain are the most common, and strains/pain from the adductors, iliopsoas, and pubic areas are typically successfully treated with conservative treatment. Often, pain from inguinal-related groin pain requires surgical intervention from a general surgeon. Femoroacetabular impingement often coexists with a variety of other pathology and may result in labral tears and chondral damage. Open or arthroscopic osteoplasty is typically successful at alleviating symptoms and has high rates of return to sport. AIIS impingement from chronic hypertrophic overuse of the rectus femoris or trauma has recently been discovered as a cause of FAI that responds well to arthroscopic decompression and osteoplasty. Ischiofemoral impingement usually responds to conservative treatment with heel lifts, physical therapy and activity modification or image-guided corticosteroid injections into the quadratus femoris. The various causes of athletic groin pain if not recognized can cause significant disability and impair athletic performance. Further study is needed in this field to further clarify the relationship between clinical syndromes, determine optimal treatment/management algorithms and the most efficacious surgical techniques.

This was compared to hip ROM measurements taken during and end of the preceding playing seasons. Subjects hip ROM were measured in the supine position with the testing hip and knee at 90° of flexion. RESULTS: Following the relative rest period after the playing season there was a significant increase in hip ROM (total, internal rotation, external rotation, dominant and non-dominant legs P<0.05) compared to measurements taken during the previous playing season/s. This was seen when compared to both the most recent playing season, as well as the average hip ROM from the previous three playing seasons.

However, the evidence underpinning this relationship appears limited. This study had two aims: 1) To describe the prevalence of bony hip morphology in male and female semi-elite football players with and without HRP; 2) To determine the relationship between HRP and bony hip morphology. Methods: 187 semi-elite football players (290 HRP hips; 51 % soccer/49 % Australian rules football (ARF); age:26yrs; height:1.79 m; weight:78 kg; 20 % women) with HRP ( >6 months of pain and + ve FADIR test) and 55 semi-elite control football players (110 control hips; 55 % soccer/45 % ARF; age:26yrs; height:1.79m; weight:79 kg; 26 % women) without HRP (no pain and -ve FADIR) were evaluated for bony hip morphology from radiographs (anteroposterior [AP] pelvis and Dunn 45 °) and completed the international hip outcome tool (iHOT33). Alpha angle was used to determine cam morphology and lateral-centre-edge-angle (LCEA) for pincer morphology. For each hip, cam morphology was defined by an alpha angle of >60 °, with pincer morphology defined by an LCEA of > 40 °. Between group differences for patient characteristics were evaluated with parametric and non-parametric tests. Linear and logistic regression with generalised estimating equations were used to estimate differences between HRP and control hips. The relationship between bony hip morphology and the iHOT33 was evaluated with Pearson's correlation coefficient. Results: Demographic characteristics were not different between groups. No differences in alpha angle (AP:1.5 °, 95 %CI–2.9–5.8;p = 0.51; Dunn:1.3 °, 95 %CI–1.9–4.41;p = 0.43) or LCEA (–1.3 °, 95 %CI–2.8–0.25;p = 0.10) were found between men with and without HRP. Women with HRP had a larger alpha angle than control women (5.9 °, 95 %CI 1.0–10.8;p = 0.02) on the Dunn but not on the AP view (–0.33 °, 95 %CI –7.3–6.6;p = 0.93). No differences in LCEA were found between women with and without HRP (0.9 °, 95 %CI–1.5,3.5;p = 0.44). The proportion of hips with cam morphology (men 78 %vs76 % OR = 1.14, 95 %CI 0.55–2.4; women 42 %vs25 %, OR = 2.09, 95 %CI 0.62–7.08) and pincer morphology (men only 7 %vs8.5 % OR = 0.97, 95 %CI 0.34–2.79) did not differ between HRP and control hips.

As such, the movement strategies of women with HRP are not well understood. Therefore, the aim of the study was to compare the work completed by the lower limb joints during the single leg drop jump (SLDJ) in women with and without HRP. Methods: Female football players were eligible to participate if aged 18-50 years and currently completing two sessions (games or training) of football per week. For the HRP group, participants had to have experienced hip and/or groin pain for a minimum of 6 months and have a positive FADIR (flexion/adduction/internal-rotation) test. Controls were required to have no lower limb pain, or injuries and a negative FADIR test. 23 women with HRP and 13 controls participated. Biomechanical data on the SLDJ were collected using a three-dimensional motion capture system and force plates. Total lower limb work was calculated along with the relative contributions of the hip, knee and ankle. Differences between groups were assessed using independent t-tests. Results: The relative contribution to negative work done at the knee was significantly led in the women with HRP compared to the control group (mean difference -4.7 %, 95 %CI -9.1 % to -0.3 %, p = 0.04). When comparing contributions across the three joints, the ankle provided the largest contribution to positive work done during the SLDJ for the HRP group (36.8 %), with the hip being the largest contributor in the controls (35.4 %). Discussion: Women with HRP absorbed significantly less energy at the knee during the SLDJ compared to controls. The reason why women with HRP do not use a knee dominant strategy for absorbing energy during the SLDJ requires further scrutiny. Despite no difference in total lower limb positive work between groups, we did observe some subtle differences amongst the joints in the relative contributions. The ankle was the dominant source of positive work during the SLDJ for women with HRP, whereas the hip was for controls. This strategy adopted by women with HRP may be an attempt to ‘offload’ the symptomatic hip. Because of the cross-sectional nature of the study it is unclear if these results are coping mechanisms or inherent movement patterns resulting in symptoms.","2019","2020-05-20 00:24:57","2020-05-20 00:24:57","","S71","","","22","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsams.2019.08.283; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002914896","adult; conference abstract; female; football player; human; hip; injury; knee; clinical article; controlled study; cohort analysis; young adult; adduction; ankle; rotation; inguinal pain; coping behavior; motion analysis system","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thirty-four male amateur soccer players were recruited for this study. Pelvic tilt was measured using the DIERS Formetric 4D. Lower extremity angles were recorded using an 8-camera Vicon motion capture system at 200 Hz while the athlete performed a high speed run on a motorised treadmill. Late swing phase was extracted from 5 running cycle which were later analysed using statistical parametric mapping (SPM). The results show that the increase of anterior pelvic tilt angle was significantly correlated with hip (r = −0.421 to −0.462, p = 0.015) and knee flexion (r = −0.424 to −0.472, p = 0.026) values. No other correlation was found between the anterior pelvic tilt and the angles at the coronal plane. By using time series analysis it was shown that the anterior pelvic tilt measured in a standing position would affect the adjacent segments’ kinematics while running as suggested in the kinetic chain theory; which would potentially predispose the soccer athletes to hamstring injury by maintaining knee extension.","2019","2020-05-20 00:24:58","2020-05-20 00:24:58","","459-466","","","66","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.humov.2019.06.001; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002095989","human; male; article; lower limb; soccer player; hip; running; velocity; abduction; knee function; treadmill test; kinematics; X ray; standing; time series analysis; motion analysis system; anterior pelvic tilt","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This research examines how coaching ability moderates extrinsic motivators (salary and contracts) on player performance. Building on motivation and sports psychology theory, this study proposes that better coaches facilitate higher paid players to perform. However, the author proposes that an increase in coaching ability weakens player performance when contracts are used as motivators. Making this challenging is evaluating player performance, especially in disentangling the player's performance from that of the team. To address these concerns, a hierarchical linear model with empirical Bayesian processes is used; the model separates player and group effects by allowing for nonindependent observations (i.e., player performance depends on team members and competitors). Using a novel and holistic data set of National Football League player performance, the findings show that, on average, an increase in coaching ability is associated with higher player performance. Coaching ability does not significantly moderate salary on player performance. Yet, increasing coaching ability negatively moderates contractual incentives on player performance. The research concludes with implications and future research directions.

Despite its highly complex skill demands, research on football goalkeeping has only sporadically examined the position within isolated and limited parameters. In particular, there is limited literature on ""modern"" skill acquisition training methods and approaches within the field of goalkeeper training. In a cross-cultural study with fifteen expert goalkeeper coaches, researchers here examined the overarching research question of ""how does the modern football goalkeeper train?"". Semi-structured interviews explored expert coaches' views on critical skills for performance in goalkeeping and the training approaches used to develop these critical skills. Results indicate that four skill sets are considered essential by goalkeeper coaches, these are: decision-making skills, athleticism, mentality, and technical skills. In terms of developing these skills in goalkeeper-specific training, the majority of expert coaches apply a similar microstructure to training sessions. This structure involves a steady progression from simple to complex training tasks, where for large parts, isolated technical training appears to be prioritised over a holistic training approach that integrates technical skills and perceptual-cognitive components (e.g., decision making). Scientific and practical recommendations for researchers and practitioners in the field of football goalkeeper coaching are provided.","2019","2020-05-20 00:25:02","2020-05-20 00:25:02","","1-9","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02640414.2019.1643202; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628769182","human; human experiment; article; football; training; decision making; motor performance; physician; scientist; semi structured interview","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Meanwhile, there was an increase in the number of minutes added to the playing time in the first half and the full game, but not in the second half. These findings may help coaches, players and managers to better understand the effects of the VAR system on professional soccer and to identify strategies to improve refereeing during matches.

The participants were 317 male and 214 female soccer players belonging to 18 teams playing in the third highest male division and to 13 teams playing in the highest female division in Spain, respectively. First, we identified the leadership structure in each team (i.e., having zero, one, two or three leaders); second, we grouped the teams according to these leadership structures; and third, MANOVA was used to compare different leadership groups in terms of their effectiveness. The results demonstrated that: (a) the most common structure within the teams was to have one task leader, one social leader, and two external leaders; (b) shared leadership across and within leadership roles was seen as the most effective leadership structure for male and female teams; and (c) male teams showed more benefits when having more task and external leaders, while female teams experienced more benefits when having more task and social leaders on the team. Based on these findings, coaches can optimize their team's functioning by implementing a structure of shared leadership within their teams, both across and within the different leadership roles.","2019","2020-05-20 00:25:05","2020-05-20 00:25:05","","","","6","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0218167; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002097678","adult; female; human; human experiment; male; article; soccer player; sport; leadership; Spain; comparative effectiveness; multivariate analysis of variance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous research that has analysed key characteristics of scoring tries in rugby union has tended to report single variables in isolation from other related behaviours. The aim of this study was to identify patterns of play that lead to scoring tries in rugby union, with the purpose of demonstrating a holistic and process-oriented approach to analysing multiple performance variables simultaneously. Data related to the match context and events leading to tries were collected. K-modes cluster analysis was used to conduct a multidimensional data analysis and identify common playing patterns that preceded a try. It was found that plays following line-outs, scrums and kick receipts were highlighted as common approaches to scoring tries. In particular, the line-out–maul combination commencing from the attacking 22-m zone was found to be the most prominent pattern identified from the cluster analysis. Coaches and analysts can use the information presented by the cluster analysis as a framework to plan and implement effective set-play and open-play strategies.

While the random forest is based on the competing teams' covariate information, the latter method estimates ability parameters on historical match data that adequately reflect the current strength of the teams. We compare the new hybrid random forest model to its separate building blocks as well as to conventional Poisson regression models with regard to their predictive performance on all matches from the four FIFA World Cups 2002–2014. It turns out that by combining the random forest with the team ability parameters from the ranking methods as an additional covariate the predictive power can be improved substantially. Finally, the hybrid random forest is used (in advance of the tournament) to predict the FIFA World Cup 2018. To complete our analysis on the previous World Cup data, the corresponding 64 matches serve as an independent validation data set and we are able to confirm the compelling predictive potential of the hybrid random forest which clearly outperforms all other methods including the betting odds.

So many people suffer from heatstroke every year. Hydration is important for preventing heatstroke during sports. In the present study, we surveyed and compared endurance sport and ball sport. Methods: Surveys were conducted at sport practices in August. Subjects were 13 female long distance runners and 59 members of a male soccer team. As survey items, temperature and humidity were measured with a dry-bulb thermometer and hygrometer and Wet Bold Globe Temperature (WBGT). We surveyed volume of water consumed, weight measurement, and frequency of nutrient consumption. Results: The proportion of athletes with a dehydration rate of 2% or more was 46% (29°C, 57%) and 0% (24°C, 89%) between 6:00-6:59 a.m ,64% (36°C, 45%),18% (32°C, 45% and 29°C, 72%) between 11:00-11:59 a.m. for endurance sports. The same proportion was 4% (27°C, 80%) and 10% (32°C, 51%) from 4:00-6:00 p.m. for ball sports. For endurance sports, almost all runners who drank water during practice had a dehydration rate of 2% or less. For ball sports, some players drank too much water. The timing for hydration was “when I felt thirsty” for 50%. Discussion: Regarding the relationship between temperature and humidity, the dehydration rate was high during high heat and low humidity. These results suggest that guidance is needed to ensure appropriate hydration and prevent heatstroke. Conclusion: We need making a manual for temperature measurements before practice, and determine the drinking interval and amount during practice may help prevent heatstroke.","2019","2020-05-20 00:25:13","2020-05-20 00:25:13","","132-133","","3","75","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1159/000501751; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629278595","adult; conference abstract; female; human; male; soccer; humidity; controlled study; summer; runner; prevention; dehydration; heat stroke; water; temperature measurement; thermometer; nutrient; drinking; endurance sport","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To determine whether similar effects occur with high-intensity intermittent exercise, we investigated the effects of HMS ingestion prior to and at halftime on soccer skill performance and repeated sprint ability during the later stages of a simulated soccer match. In total, 11 male university varsity soccer players (height = 177.7 ± 6.8 cm, body mass = 77.3 ± 7.9 kg, age = 22 ± 3 years, body fat = 12.8 ± 4.9%, and maximal oxygen uptake = 57.1 ± 3.9 ml·kg BM-1·min-1) completed the match with HMS (8% carbohydrate containing a total of 0.7 g·kg BM-1·hr-1; 2.8 kcal·kg BM-1·hr-1) or isoenergetic dextrose. Blood glucose was lower (p < .001) with HMS at 15 min (5.3 vs. 7.7 mmol/L) and 30 min (5.6 vs. 8.3 mmol/L) following ingestion, there were no treatment differences in blood lactate, and the respiratory exchange ratio was lower with HMS at 15 min (0.84 vs. 0.86, p = .003); 30 min (0.83 vs. 0.85, p = .004); and 45 min (0.83 vs. 0.85, p = .007) of the first half. Repeated sprint performance was similar for both treatments (p > .05). Soccer dribbling time was slower with isoenergetic dextrose versus baseline (15.63 vs. 14.43 s, p < .05) but not sowithHMS(15.04 vs. 14.43 s, p > .05). Furthermore, during the passing test, penalty time was reduced (4.27 vs. 7.73 s, p = .004) with HMS. During situations where glycogen availability is expected to become limiting, HMS ingestion prematch and at halftime could attenuate the decline in skill performance often seen late in contests.","2019","2020-05-20 00:25:14","2020-05-20 00:25:14","","498-504","","5","29","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1123/ijsnem.2018-0217; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2004195348","adult; human; human experiment; male; article; soccer; soccer player; oxygen consumption; controlled study; body mass; young adult; body weight; high intensity interval training; normal human; body height; body fat; simulation; carbohydrate; glucose; task performance; oxygen; lung gas exchange; ingestion; punishment; glycogen; starch; time","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

He was playing rugby and had completed three outdoor matches immediately before his seizure. The patient had consumed four liters of water and three large bottles of Gatorade during the matches, and endorsed not eating all day. Vital signs were unremarkable except for an oxygen saturation of 97% on high flow nasal cannula supplemental oxygen (FiO2 40% delivered at 40 L/min). His physical exam revealed orientation to self-only, diffuse pulmonary crackles, normal cranial nerve function, and normal tendon reflexes with symmetric and intact muscle strength bilaterally. Laboratory studies showed a serum sodium of 122 mmol/L, serum osmolality 255 mOsm/kg, urine osmolality 270 mOsm/kg, and creatine kinase 1,750 U/L. A CT head without contrast demonstrated mild diffuse cerebral edema. A chest x-ray was also obtained which demonstrated a diffuse alveolar filling process with relative sparing of the lung bases (see image). The patient was diagnosed with exercise-associated hyponatremia with a rare complication of cerebral and pulmonary edema. The etiology of this disorder is primarily due to overzealous hypotonic fluid consumption with associated non-osmotic antidiuteric hormone (ADH) secretion. The seizures were secondary to his cerebral edema, which never recurred after the correction of his hyponatremia. Pulmonary edema was secondary to increased pulmonary vasculature hydrostatic pressure due to hyperactive sympathetic neurological output that was secondary to his cerebral edema. A similar mechanism is thought to occur in neurogenic pulmonary edema, which is seen in a multitude of cerebral insults. Treatment consisted primarily of supportive care, which resulted in correction of the patient's serum sodium within 24 hours using a combination of hypertonic saline initially followed by fluid restriction. As the patient's serum sodium improved (139 mmol/L) he developed a self-limited large volume auto-diuresis (0.51 to 0.85 L/hour) over 4 to 5 hours (total in-and-out volume was negative 6.4 L in 24 hours). Repeat urine osmolality of 76 mOsm/kg with simultaneous correction of his serum osmolality (287 mOsm/kg) indicating recovery of the ADH axis as the etiology of the large volume diuresis. Coincident with these electrolyte and fluid changes, the patient's chest x-ray also improved, which directly correlated with resolution of his hypoxemia and rapid clinical improvement in mental status and neurological exam.","2019","2020-05-20 00:25:20","2020-05-20 00:25:20","","","","9","199","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L630355160","adult; conference abstract; human; male; rugby; case report; clinical article; exercise; oxygen saturation; muscle strength; human tissue; physical examination; thorax radiography; complication; medical history; endogenous compound; cranial nerve; tendon reflex; drug combination; cerebrovascular accident; emergency ward; mental health; water; oxygen; hormone; hormone release; brain edema; eating; sports drink; hyponatremia; crackle; creatine kinase BB; diuresis; hydrostatic pressure; hypoxemia; lung alveolus; lung blood vessel; lung edema; lung infiltrate; nasal cannula; nerve function; serum osmolality; sodium blood level; sodium chloride; urine osmolality; vital sign","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While blocking the punt, the patient received a direct blow to his abdomen. After several steps, the patient collapsed to the ground with difficulty breathing and on scene athletic training staff responded immediately. After several minutes, breathing and pain improved and patient was able to ambulate and return to full contact practice with no limitations other than some mild abdominal muscle soreness. After practice, patient had decreased appetite and was only drinking fluids. While at study hall that night, he developed worsening abdominal pain and returned to his room. The pain continued through the evening with emesis, leading to notification of the resident assistant and EMS activation. Patient presented to the Emergency Room with abdominal pain. Physical Exam: Afebrile, BP 128/54, pulse 60, RR 20. Abdomen is soft with voluntary guarding. Diffuse tenderness to palpation, with no rebound tenderness. A contusion with cleat marks is visible near the umbilicus. Normal active bowel sounds. No pelvic crepitus. Remainder of exam was non-contributory. Differential Diagnosis: Splenic Injury Liver Injury Viscous Organ Injury Abdominal Wall Contusion with developing hematoma Traumatic Pancreatitis Test Results: WBC-18.6, Hgb-15.3, Hct-45, Plt-261, AST 13, ALT 35, LDH 600, Amylase-215, Lipase-1814CT Abdomen-Liver, spleen, adrenals and kidneys are unremarkable. Pancreas appears intact without definite fracture, however there is some peripancreatic inflammatory changes, as well as minimal fluid or blood within the retroperitoneum at and below the level of the pancreas and some streaky changes within the upper mesenteric fat. Findings are suggestive of possible traumatic pancreatitis or occult injury. Final Diagnosis: (1) Laceration of the Pancreas. (2) Traumatic Pancreatitis. Discussion: Injuries to the pancreas are rare, occurring about 2% in blunt trauma. Solitary injuries are even rarer as another abdominal organ is injured 90% of the time. These injuries are usually caused by motor vehicle crashes or handle bar injuries and occur when force to the abdomen compresses the pancreas against the spine. Those with less abdominal fat are at higher risk of injury and the injury has high morbidity. Diagnosis may be difficult at first given non-specific exam findings and labs and possibly normal CT imaging in 20% to 40% of cases. In this case, given the patient was extended at the time of injury may have exposed the pancreas more when he was kicked, leading to the isolated injury. Outcome: Patient was admitted for observation. He developed peritoneal signs the following day and was taken for an emergent exploratory laparotomy where he was found to have an isolated laceration of the pancreas without ductal involvement. The injury was repaired and a feeding tube placed. He was taken to the Trauma ICU post-operatively. After a 3-week hospital course, the patient was discharged to home. Follow-up: The patient did not return to play for the remainder of the season but attended the final game as a spectator. He was medically clear to resume workouts the following semester. The patient transferred schools the following year and returned to playing football in a full contact intramural league. He ultimately went on to medical school and received a commission in the Navy as a physician.","2019","2020-05-20 00:25:21","2020-05-20 00:25:21","","e20-e21","","2","29","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/JSM.0000000000000728; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629860201","adult; conference abstract; football player; human; male; case report; clinical article; season; training; young adult; follow up; outcome assessment; fracture; hospital discharge; endogenous compound; dyspnea; diagnosis; differential diagnosis; emergency ward; medical school; contusion; organ injury; morbidity; night; palpation; spine; kidney; drinking; abdominal fat; abdominal pain; abdominal viscera; abdominal wall musculature; adrenal gland; amylase; aspartate aminotransferase level; compress; decreased appetite; feeding tube; hematoma; intestine sound; knockout gene; laparotomy; liver injury; mesenteric fat; motor vehicle; navy; pancreatitis; peritoneum; rebound; resident; retroperitoneum; spleen injury; triacylglycerol lipase; umbilicus; vomiting","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Self‐Determination Theory (SDT; Deci & Ryan, 1980) has shown to be pragmatically successful in sport and suggests that being regulated by autonomous forms of motivation leads to better psychological outcomes. Cultural psychologists would be tempted to dismiss SDT because it is predicated on an a‐cultural approach to mind. It is possible to nurture a stronger and more effective team culture by reframing SDT in a cultural direction. As such, this paper outlines a cultural approach that reconceptualizes SDT in a way that retains the latter's pragmatic value while not approaching mind in a self‐contained individualist manner.

On the other hand, studies of a tactical nature, and more specifically the static situations of the game, still remain outside the research framework. The aim of this study has been twofold: on the one hand, to know and compare the regularity, effectiveness and importance of the corners in the FIFA Women's World Cup 2015 as opposed to the FIFA World Cup 2014; On the other, through the realization of different contingency tables and the application of a Chi-Square, we proceeded to identify the variables associated with success for the three criteria considered: shot, shot between the posts and goal. 1117 corner kicks executed in 116 games were coded and analyzed. The results indicate a high regularity of these actions during the men's and women's world, and a low efficiency in terms of auction, shot between the three clubs and goal for both genders. With regard to the variables that are conditioning the success, although moderate differences are observed in both championships, the corners in women's football must continue taking steps towards the construction of a model of offensive management.

For this, the twenty Spanish first division teams in the 2016–2017 season were analysed, using nine interaction performance indicators (IRi). A principal component (PC) analysis was applied. From two PCs four SoPs were established: deep or high-pressure defending, and elaborate or direct attack. The SoPs were distributed according to average performance obtained throughout the championship. The connection between the preferred SoP and the final result was estimated. Teams with elaborate offensive styles and teams defensively minded got better results. In addition, most of the teams showed variability in their SoP. The applications of the study are (1) the IRi have served to identify SoP and can be used as a reference to optimize team performance; (2) teams should have a varied SoP repertoire, as well as being prepared to deal with different SoPs; (3) particular player profiles should be connected with the desired SoP when creating the squad and (4) clubs should develop a varied range of SoPs at their academies.","2019","2020-05-20 00:25:27","2020-05-20 00:25:27","","","","24","16","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph16245090; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2003352735","human; article; football; season; team sport; principal component analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Elite Australian football umpires (n = 19) and their coaches (n = 5) participated in this study. A list of attributes necessary for sports officiating was obtained from past research and adapted specifically for Australian football umpires. Umpires were required to rate each attribute on a scale of 0–9 (least to most importance), and provide a justification of its importance to performance. A modified questionnaire was developed with attributes removed or added, according to the first survey round. This research identified two cognitive attributes: knowing the laws/interpretations and decision-making as the two highest rated attributes, respectively. Psychological attributes composure and concentration were rated highly by the umpires, ranked as number three and five, respectively. The game skill attribute of teamwork was rated as the fourth highest. Fitness was the only physical attribute to be rated in the most important category. Results highlight the importance of cognitive and psychological attributes to elite performance; however, participant feedback suggests that the integration of all attributes is critical. This knowledge establishes an understanding of the key attributes for expert performance, and this information could be used by coaches for the assessment and development of Australian football umpires.

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to identify performance-related parameters in young competitive athletes. Methods: Individual performance developments of 146 young athletes (m: n = 96, f: n = 50, age V1: 14.7 ± 1.7 years) of four different sports (soccer: n = 45, cycling: n = 48, swimming: n = 18, cross-country skiing: n = 35) were evaluated by analysis of 356 visits in total (exercise intervention periods, 289 ± 112 d). At V1 and V2 several performance parameters were determined. Based on the relative performance progress (Δ), potential influencing predictors were analyzed: training load, health sense, stress level, clinical complaints, hemoglobin, vitamin D, hs-CRP and EBV serostatus. Data were collected within a controlled, prospective study on young athletes, which was conducted between 2010 and 2014. Results: Athletes improved their performance by 4.7 ± 10.7%. In total, 66.3% of all athletes represented a positive performance progress. This group demonstrated, despite similar training loads (p = 0.207), enhanced health senses (p = 0.001) and lower stress levels (p = 0.002). In contrast, compared to athletes with an impaired performance progress, no differences in hemoglobin values (m: p = 0.926, f: p = 0.578), vitamin D levels (0.787) and EBV serostatus (p = 0.842) were found. Performance progress was dependent on extents of health senses (p = 0.040) and stress levels (p = 0.045). Furthermore, the combination of declined health senses and rised stress levels was associated with an impaired performance development (p = 0.018) and higher prevalences of clinical complaints (p < 0.001) above all, in contrast to hs-CRP (p = 0.168). Discussion: Athletes with an improved performance progress reported less pronounced subjective sensations and complaints. In contrast, objective known performance-related indicators, offered no differences. Therefore, subjective self-reported data, reflecting health and stress status, should be additionally considered to regulate training, modify intensities, and finally, predict and ensure an optimal performance advance.","2019","2020-05-20 00:25:29","2020-05-20 00:25:29","","","","","10","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2019.01394; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629991674","female; human; human experiment; male; article; exercise; controlled study; prospective study; physical performance; training; adolescent; athlete; prediction; hemoglobin; C reactive protein; aerobic exercise; age; swimming; competitive behavior; vitamin D; biological marker; stress; health status; skiing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Final functional outcomes are generally excellent, though recurrent symptoms may delay the return to play. There is a lack of published evidence on conservative management and rehabilitation for this injury. The aim of this case study is to describe a comprehensive and successful rehabilitation plan of a youth elite soccer player. Case Presentation: A 16-year-old male centre-back soccer player sustained a left iliac crest avulsion fracture. The injury occurred while executing a right-footed long cross of the ball, right to left. Intervention: After a short period of rest (including a lumbosacral orthosis), rehabilitation progressed from non-weight-bearing through to an array of sports-specific full weight-bearing exercises. The field sessions were individualised, based on the player's physiological profile and match characteristics in non-linear dynamics. Outcomes: The player recovered fully and returned pain-free at the same international football level after 14 weeks. There has been no recurrence since. Conclusion: An iliac crest avulsion fracture in youth soccer can be fully recovered by conservative management. Early diagnosis, close monitoring, progressive (individualised) sports-specific rehabilitation and good compliance were key factors in the successful return to play.

Occlusion was achieved using goggles that removed the sight of the lower limbs and football as it was projected towards the participants. Methods: Fifteen skilled male football players were randomly assigned to one of three groups; Occlusion, Practice and Control. Participants were required to control a projected football, before passing it to one of two designated targets, while concurrently identifying a series of randomly generated numbers. Pass direction was determined by a directional arrow that accompanied each number, which coincided with the football release. The study design consisted of a pre-test, training intervention (400 trials), post-test and 2-day retention test. The performance was evaluated via three variables: outcome error, control error and number call error. Results: The results demonstrated a significant decrease in outcome error (p < 0.05) and number call error (p < 0.05) for the Occlusion group from pre-test to post and retention test. No significant decrease was experienced from post-test to retention test (p> 0.05), demonstrating a learning effect. Conclusion: This suggests that reducing visual information during training may have a positive impact on performance once full visual conditions are restored.

Our research was aimed at finding out the impact of age and agility performance level on the length of the disjunctive reaction time of elite goalkeepers in Slovakia. The research group was comprised of 24 goalkeepers of two Slovak soccer clubs (in group A were elite players and in group B sub-elite players). To gain the research data, the disjunctive reaction time was measured using the Fitro Agility Check device. The acquired results were statistically evaluated using the Mann-Whitney U-Test and Cohen's ""d"". The impact of age (n.s) and performance level (n.s) on the length of the disjunctive reaction time of goalkeepers was not statistically confirmed. However, the substantive and logical significance showed that the best goalkeepers achieved a considerably shorter time of disjunctive reaction time to the set stimulus (difference – 20 %).

This study sought to determine the time to return to play and quantitative impact on athletic performance after clavicle fractures in NFL athletes. DESIGN: Retrospective Cohort Study; Level of evidence, 3. SETTING: Retrospective cohort study of NFL athletes based on published injury reports and player statistics. PARTICIPANTS: This study consisted of 17 NFL athletes who sustained a clavicle fracture from 1998 to 2015 and returned to the field after the injury during the study period. Three athletes were excluded from performance analysis because of not playing for the entire season after injury. Control groups consisted of position-matched NFL athletes who competed in the 2013 NFL season without an identified clavicle injury. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Median time to return to play after a clavicle fracture and the impact on player performance rating. RESULTS: Athletes returned to the competition after a median of 3.47 months after injury and missed a median of 8 games. There was no statistically significant impact on athletic performance after returning to play. CONCLUSION: Although clavicle fractures did have a significant impact on athletes because of lost playing time, there was no statistically significant difference in player performance after the injury when compared with a control group.","2019","2020-05-20 00:25:37","2020-05-20 00:25:37","","459-464","","6","29","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/JSM.0000000000000548; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629766639","human; male; football; injury; return to sport; retrospective study; athletic performance; fracture; United States; time factor; clavicle","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, limited knowledge exists about the impact of anxiety on the use of such contextual priors when forming our decisions. We provide a novel insight into the combined impact of contextual priors and anxiety on anticipation in soccer. Altogether, 12 expert soccer players were required to predict the actions of an oncoming opponent while viewing life-sized video simulations of 2-versus-2 defensive scenarios. Performance effectiveness and processing efficiency were measured under four conditions: no contextual priors (CP) about the action tendencies of the opponent and low anxiety (LA); no CP and high anxiety (HA); CP and LA; CP and HA. The provision of contextual priors did not affect processing efficiency, but it improved performance effectiveness on congruent trials. Anxiety negatively affected processing efficiency, but this did not affect the use of contextual priors or influence performance effectiveness. It appears that anxiety and prior contextual information impact attentional resources independent of each other. Findings are discussed with reference to current models of anticipation and anxiety.","2019","2020-05-20 00:25:39","2020-05-20 00:25:39","","589-596","","3","33","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02699931.2018.1464434; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L621756248","adult; human; human experiment; article; soccer; soccer player; priority journal; controlled study; young adult; prediction; decision making; anxiety; videorecording; task performance; anticipation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In particular, good hydration status is critical during and after training sessions and competition events. As exercise performance and postexercise recovery can be significantly impaired when hydration status is not adequate, the aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of hydration status on recovery indexes on professional athletes. Twenty-eight professional soccer players, aged between 18 and 35 y, were subjects for the study. Body composition and in particular hydration status were assessed trough Bioelectrical Impedance Test (BIA) using single-frequency bioimpedance (BIA AKERN101). Recovery was analyzed using a specific test (GQR-TIA) where a scale from 0 to 10 indicates from 'need absolute rest, no recovery' to 'ready for the competition, total recovery'. Statistical analysis was carried on using SPSS®. Correlation coefficients were calculated to assess the relationship between variables. Significance level was set at p≤0.05. The analysis of body composition and recovery revealed that there is a statistically significant correlation between hydration status and recovery taking into account age. Indeed, it was possible to observe that in dehydrated subjects, as the age increases, test results decrease with a statistically significant correlation coefficient of -0.888 while in hydrated subject the correlation was found to be weaker, around an half, with a statistical significant correlation coefficient of -0.418. High-intensity exercise in athletes and regularly active individuals typically results in dehydration that can affect physical performance and mental capacity. Moreover, it is well known that recovery after exercise is dependent on several factors i.e. age and body composition. From this study, it was possible to observe as dehydration has an important impact on recovery after exercise above all in relation to age. Indeed, as age increases, recovery index decreases twice faster in dehydrated subjects than in euhydrated ones. So, hydration status and above all specific rehydration strategies resulted to be of fundamental importance both to achieve a better performance and also to better recover after exercise or competition.","2019","2020-05-20 00:25:43","2020-05-20 00:25:43","","13","","","29","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1123/ijsnem.2019-0057; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628160067","adult; conference abstract; human; soccer player; exercise; controlled study; physical performance; competition; statistical analysis; remission; rest; correlation coefficient; body composition; dehydration; hydration status; rehydration; impedance; mental capacity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study uses the historical method and Oliver's six IR determinants to understand the interaction between the bowl system of the National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I Football Bowl Subdivision and IR on various performance metrics, status, and new product development. In sum, the findings point to patterns of successful IR among the various tiers of bowl games and their partners through (a) conference agreements, (b) television network agreements, and (c) corporate/title sponsors. Notably, many bowl games managed to flourish and some even improved their status; however, the findings also allude to episodes of failure and indicate sport organizations rich in resources may be slower to establish IR because of resource buffers. Finally, the authors show the bowl industry produced new products via strategic alliances when certain conditions are met regarding asymmetry, reciprocity, and efficiency. Furthermore, the authors contribute to the literature on IR in sport by discussing implications for sport managers.

The Adductor Strengthening Programme is the first groin-specific prevention program shown to reduce the risk of groin problems. We aimed to use the RE-AIM framework to examine the players' experiences with the implementation of the program and player attitude toward groin injury prevention in football. Of the 632 players involved in the trial examining the effect of the Adductor Strengthening Programme, 501 agreed to participate in a survey at the end of the season. Most players thought that footballers are at moderate to high risk for groin injuries (87%) and that there is a need for preventive measures (96%). They also believed that a preventive program with strengthening exercises would reduce the risk of groin injuries (91%). Majority of the players reported using <5 minutes to complete the program (73%), and only 11% wanted additional exercises. However, only 46% reported to have performed the program as recommended, and an even smaller proportion (31%) planned to continue using it as recommended the next season. Our results suggest that footballers believe that prevention of groin injuries is needed. Attitude toward implementation of the Adductor Strengthening Programme was positive, and the single-exercise approach was considered an important facilitator. However, in future dissemination of the program, the players' reluctance to maintain the exercise protocol may be a potential barrier to implementation that should be addressed.","2019","2020-05-20 00:25:50","2020-05-20 00:25:50","","1092-1100","","8","29","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L627656113; http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/sms.13444","adult; human; male; soccer; sport injury; injury; controlled study; adolescent; athlete; young adult; questionnaire; randomized controlled trial; cross-sectional study; inguinal region; attitude to health; kinesiotherapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is a sport characterized by unpredictability: in every moment, new situations arise with which the player must relate and to which he must respond adequately. Indecision or carelessness can change the outcome of a game. The complex (and uncomplicated) structure of the game should be trained right through complexity, so that the player can recognize what happens during the game, ie those situations that are found in the game itself. Starting from the youth sector it is necessary to train memory, perception, concentration skills and situation analysis. We need to recreate actions that are more likely to the game, but stimulate reasoning as a training factor. Once the player has gained experience, he will automatically be able to recreate it in the game. The aim of this study is precisely to demonstrate the need to provide young people with a strong technical-coordination base, stimulating the psychokinetic component. In practice, it is necessary to equip the child with a wide technical repertoire that can be used during a game, thus reducing that sense of loss and abandonment to improvisation. In this paper, various exercises will be proposed concerning both the coordinative technical component and the psychokinetic component; the main findings will be analyzed, and compared with the numerous epistemological references present in the literature.

Additionally, the developed tests were evaluated for their validity with regard to the differentiation of two performance-levels. Thirty-two professional male futsal players (age = 26.22 ± 5.22 years; body height = 182.13 ± 5.99 cm, body mass = 77.43 ± 8.00 kg) participated in the study. The sample was divided into two groups based on their level of futsal performance: A top-level-group (n = 12) and a team-level-group (n = 20). The variables included body height, mass, body mass index, a sprint over a 10-m distance (S10M), and eight newly developed futsal specific CODS and RAG tests. The CODS and RAG tests were performed by dribbling the balls (CODS_D and RAG_D) and without dribbling (CODS_T and RAG_T), and the performances on the dominant and non-dominant sides were observed separately. All CODS, and RAG tests performed on dominant side and RAG_T tests performed on the non-dominant side had good inter-testing (CV = 5–8%; ICC = 0.76–0.89) and intra-testing (CV = 4–9%; ICC = 0.77–0.91) reliability. However, RAG_D performed on the non-dominant side was not reliable (ICC = 0.60, CV = 10%). The top-level-players outperformed the team-level-players in the CODS and RAG tests that involved dribbling (t-test: 4.28 and 2.40, p < 0.05; effect sizes (ES): 0.81 and 1.5, respectively), while the team-level players achieved better results in the CODS_T (t-test: 2.08, p < 0.05; ES: 0.60). The proposed CODS and RAG tests that involved dribbling over a 3.2-m distance, especially on the dominant side, appeared to be reliable, as well as valid for distinguishing the performance level in futsal players.","2019","2020-05-20 00:25:52","2020-05-20 00:25:52","","","","18","16","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph16183246; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002619200","adult; human; male; article; clinical article; controlled study; team sport; body mass; velocity; agility; validity; body height; effect size; reliability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is likely the case that the pathway to further development and a spot on the national team for a young player is, at least initially, through a domestic football league. Yet the stage of development of football leagues differs markedly across nations. This paper finds that the presence and development of these leagues is a significant contributor to FIFA points for the national side, but with diminishing returns. Most recently, the largest effect is found for the nations that play in the African (CAF) and Oceania (OFC) zones, while the other four zones (AFC, CONCACAF, CONMEBOL and UEFA) share smaller positive effects. Even in the presence of limiting economic and demographic factors, the road to international football success is through the development of domestic leagues.

Importance of physical qualities for speed and change of direction ability in elite female soccer players. J Strength Cond Res 33(6): 1670-1678, 2019-The purpose of this study was to determine the importance of physical qualities for speed and change of direction (CoD) ability in female soccer players. Data were collected on 10 female soccer players who were part of a professional English Women's Super League team. Player assessments included anthropometric (stature and body mass), body composition (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry), speed (10-m and 20-m sprints), CoD ability (505 agility), aerobic (Yo-Yo Intermittent Recovery Test), lower-body strength (bilateral knee extensions), and power (countermovement jump [CMJ], squat jump [SJ], 30-cm drop jump [DJ]) measures. The relationships between the variables were evaluated using eigenvector analysis and Pearson correlation analysis. Multiple linear regression revealed that the performance variables (10 and 20 m speed, mean 505, and CoD deficit mean) can be predicted with almost 100% accuracy (i.e., adjusted R > 0.999) using various combinations of the predictor variables (DJ height, CMJ height, SJ height, and lean body mass). An increase of 1 SD in DJ height was associated with reductions of -5.636 and -9.082 SD in 10-m and 20-m sprint times. One SD increase in CMJ also results in a reduction of -3.317 and -0.922 SD, respectively, in mean 505 and CoD deficit mean values. This study provides comparative data for professional English female soccer players that can be used by strength and conditioning coaches when monitoring player development and assessing the effectiveness of training programs. Findings highlight the importance of developing reactive strength to improve speed and CoD ability in female soccer players.","2019","2020-05-20 00:25:55","2020-05-20 00:25:55","","1669-1677","","6","33","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1519/JSC.0000000000002114; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L627996121","adult; female; human; soccer; adolescent; young adult; physiology; running; body weight; muscle strength; exercise test; body height; athletic performance; body composition; body position","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previously published studies describing lower extremity injuries among National Football League (NFL) players often rely on convenience samples from publiclyreported injury information, often from the lay press, which may be inaccurate, incomplete, and biased towards more severe injuries. Objectives: Accurately characterize incidence and impact of lower extremity injuries in NFL athletes through use of a high quality, closed electronic medical record (EMR) data collection system, and to compare findings to previously published studies that utilized publiclyreported injury information. Methods: All 32 NFL teams report injuries into the league-wide EMR under mandated, consistent data collection guidelines. Lower extremity injuries reported during 2015-2017 regular season games were included, with. Injury data were linked with game statistics and player participation, including the number of plays each player participated in for each game. Rates per 1,000 game-plays and 10,000 player-plays were calculated along with 95% CI for injuries overall, by specific lower body injury, and stratified by characteristics such as roster position and play type. Descriptive statistics were generated for number of days missed from football participation for each injury. Findings were compared to previously published results in the same population. Results: Lower extremity injuries that resulted in missed time occurred at a rate of 21.5 (21.0,22.0) injuries per 1,000 plays (n = 3538 over 3 seasons). Incidence of the most severe injuries was similar to that reported from publicly available data; for example, occurrence of 34 game-related Achilles ruptures across 5 years was captured in both the EMR and a publication based on public reports (Krill et al, 2017). However, injuries such as Jones fractures, which range in severity and impact, were more likely to be underestimated; one published study (Parekh et al, 2017) reported only 53.8% of the Jones fractures that were reported in the EMR. Conclusions: Use of a closed EMR, in this case within the NFL, linked with game statistics and player participation, provides the ability to capture reliable injury occurrence and player exposure, which are necessary for incidence and impact assessment of these important injuries. This system can be extended more broadly to health systems interested in characterizing adverse event rates or for performing surveillance and risk management.","2019","2020-05-20 00:25:57","2020-05-20 00:25:57","","270","","","28","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pds.4864; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629265471","conference abstract; human; football; rupture; incidence; major clinical study; season; fracture; human tissue; practice guideline; leg injury; nonhuman; risk management; achilles tendon; electronic medical record; krill","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although similar effects are expected in females, this is yet to be elucidated. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of maximal strength training on sprint speed and jump height in high-level female football players. Methods: Two female football teams were team-cluster-randomized to a training group (TG) performing maximal strength training (MST) twice a week for 5 weeks, or control group (CG) doing their regular pre-season preparations. The MST consisted of 3–4 sets of 4–6 repetitions at ≥85% of 1 repetitions maximum (1RM) in a squat exercise. Sprint speed and jump height were assessed in 5-, 10- and 15 m sprints and a counter-movement jump (CMJ) test, respectively. Nineteen participants in TG (18.3 ± 2.7 years) and 14 in CG (18.3 ± 2.4 years) completed pre- and posttests and were carried forward for final analyses. Results: There was no improvement in neither of the sprint times (p > 0.36), nor jump height (p = 0.87). The players increased their 1RM in squats (main of effect of time: p < 0.00, pη2 = 0.704), and an interaction effect of time x group was observed (p < 0.00, pη2 = 0.516) where the TG increased their 1RM more than the CT (between subjects effects: p < 0.001, pη2 = 0.965). Conclusions: MST improved maximal strength in female football players to a large extent; however, the improvement in maximal strength did not result in any transference to sprint speed or jump height.

The acquisition of football technique has often been topic of debate about the real methodological approach to adopt in the adolescence. Purpose - The aim of this study, on a sample of twenty (20) young athletes (aged 15-17 - mean age 16 ± 0.5) participating in agonistic football competitions, was to evaluate the improvement in performance, with reference to the percentage of accuracy of passages and shots on goal, verifying the quality of training methods choices. The research was carried on through an observational method and manual computerized detection, from October 2017 to April 2018, and general and diversified technical tests. The athletes (weight 62-73 kg - mean 67.79 ± 4.79; height 173 - 187 - mean 179.78 ± 5.23) divided into group A and B, took part in training (weekly- monthly) with the technical staff. Only 10 athletes of group B, partecipated 20 additional training sessions to improve their technical and physical learning. Results and conclusion - The final result for both groups showed significant improvements in young athletes performances with particular reference to the percentage of accuracy of passages and shots on goal, valued around 5-7% (average percentage 6%). Group B said to have received benefits after participating extra training sessions, showing an increase in muscle tone, a better breathing control and greater accuracy in passages and shots on goal, proving validity of choices in training method.

Athletics is used at training of football referees. At the same time, there is no methodological explanation for the effectiveness of using athletes' exercises for football referees. This was the actual research topic. The information on the topic that can be found in the scientific and methodological literature is not systematized and is fragmentary. However, it can form the basis for developing a modern methodology to define the physical preparedness of football referees. This was the basis for the purpose of the study, which is to develop an effective method of physical training for football referees using athletics. The theoretical review of the scientific and methodological literature, questionnaires, recording of load characteristics using the Polar M400 sports watch, timekeeping, pedagogical testing, and methods of mathematical statistics were used during the research. The principal method is observation and experiment. The status of the question of the physical training of football referees was determined to fulfill the research goal; the properties of motor activity of football referees of various qualifications are revealed. The paper developed and experimentally tested the effectiveness of physical athletics-based training methods for football referees. The practical and theoretical significance of the research is reflected in the results and conclusions of the work. The practical significance of the research is in the development of the physical athletics-based training method of football referees. The situational control standard for football referees has been prepared and tested to determine the degree of physical readiness, considering the specificity of their motor activity. The theoretical significance is in the following: - The specification and addition of the latest theoretical data, the characteristics of the professional activity of football referees; - The creation of theoretical provisions of the physical athletics-based training method of football referees; - A highly informative benchmark is recommended that include the individual and distinctive features of the motor activity of the referees.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was twofold as follows: (1) to determine the changes in match-based physical performance parameters in professional soccer players before and after sustaining a hamstring strain injury and undergoing a soccer-specific rehabilitation program and (2) to observe the progress of these performance parameters 6 to 10 weeks after the player returned from injury. DESIGN: Prospective, quasi-experimental longitudinal study. SETTING: Soccer playing and training grounds. PARTICIPANTS: Nineteen players suffering a hamstring strain injury from 2 male professional teams playing in the Spanish professional football league (La Liga) were followed during the 2015-2016, 2016-2017, and 2017-2018 seasons. INTERVENTION: Participation in on-field training program following a hamstring injury. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Match global positioning system data were collected in the following stages: prior to injury (PRE), after return to play (RTP), program, and 6 to 10 weeks following RTP (C2). Peak velocities and distances ran at sprint velocities showed most likely improvements in C2 versus PRE, and very likely improvements in RTP versus PRE. RESULTS: The distances ran at high and very high intensities, the average velocity, and work-to-rest ratio showed very likely improvements in C2 versus RTP and likely improvements in RTP versus PRE. Likely improvements were observed for all variables in C2 versus RTP. The authors' results showed an improvement of physical performance during competitive match after RTP, compared with PRE. There was a steady progression in the progress, and in 8 months following RTP, there was no injury reported in the players. CONCLUSIONS: The current findings may indicate that the hamstring muscle complex not only recovered completely from the injury but could also withstand a greater training and match load reducing the risk of reinjury.","2019","2020-05-20 00:26:05","2020-05-20 00:26:05","","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1123/jsr.2019-0033; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L630416917","adult; human; male; article; football; soccer player; injury; controlled study; prospective study; season; physical performance; training; velocity; longitudinal study; global positioning system; biceps femoris muscle; disease course","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Various studies have investigated injury mechanisms, prevention programmes and immediate medical management of these injuries. However, relatively scant attention has been placed on the player's experience of such an injury and the importance of context. AIM: The aim of this study was to explore the injury experience and its related context, as perceived by the catastrophically injured player. METHODS: A qualitative approach was followed to explore the immediate, postevent injury experience. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 48 (n=48) players who had sustained a rugby-related ASCI. RESULTS: Four themes were derived from the data. Participants described the context around the injury incident, which may be valuable to help understand the mechanism of injury and potentially minimise risk. Participants also described certain contributing factors to their injury, which included descriptions of foul play and aggression, unaccustomed playing positions, pressure to perform and unpreparedness. The physical experience included signs and symptoms of ASCI that is important to recognise by first aiders, fellow teammates, coaches and referees. Lastly, participants described the emotional experience which has implications for all ASCI first responders. SIGNIFICANCE: All rugby stakeholders, including players, first responders, coaches and referees, may gain valuable information from the experiences of players who have sustained these injuries. This information is also relevant for rugby safety initiatives in shaping education and awareness interventions.","2019","2020-05-20 00:26:06","2020-05-20 00:26:06","","313-320","","4","25","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/injuryprev-2018-042871; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628819799","adult; human; male; football; sport injury; injury; pathophysiology; spinal cord injury; adolescent; young adult; risk factor; middle aged; aged; qualitative research; aggression; disabled person; life event","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Oculomotor performance, measured utilizing the King-Devick/Eye Tracking test (K-D/ET), is reported to be able to identify sub-optimal brain function. The objectives of the study were to determine the diagnostic accuracy of the K-D/ET in identifying SRC occurring from game participation and to perform a comparative analysis on saccade and blink counts for each K-D card individually and total counts between baseline and post-concussion. Methods: Nineteen male Australian Football players were assessed on the K-D/ET test. Those suspected of having SRC secondary to a head impact were also tested. Results: Participants recorded a slower time on the third (20.2 ± 4.6 s) screen when compared with the first (p = 0.0424) and second (p = 0.0150) screens. The number of blinks was higher on the third (2.9 ± 2.9) when compared with the second (p = 0.0057) screen. There was decrease of the K-D/ET total times between pre- and post-game (p = 0.1769). Participants who sustained a head impact recorded slower mean total K-D time (p = 0.7322), fewer mean total saccades (p = 0.0112), and more mean blinks (p = 0.8678) compared with their baseline scores. The assessment of blinks was the most sensitive measure for potential SRC (0.67). The K-D/ET duration was the most specific measure for potential SRC (0.88). An increase in the number of blinks had a fair specificity of 0.69. Conclusion: The rapid number-naming component of the K-D test is an assessment tool which quantifies impairment to oculomotor function and has been validated as a diagnostic tool for SRC. The clinical usefulness of the eye tracking component of the K-D/ET test is that it may be an effective method to assess concussions with the eye tracking component serving as a measure of progression and return to play. However, more research is required at the adult and youth level.","2019","2020-05-20 00:26:08","2020-05-20 00:26:08","","78-84","","1","47","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00913847.2018.1525261; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L624061973","human; male; article; sport injury; clinical article; observational study; prospective study; return to sport; adolescent; cohort analysis; concussion; head injury; predictive value; diagnostic test accuracy study; sensitivity and specificity; traumatic brain injury; task performance; test retest reliability; eye tracking; diagnostic accuracy; electrooculogram; eye movement control; eye movement monitor; eyelid reflex; king devick eye tracking test; oculography; ophthalmological diagnostic device; saccadic eye movement; visual system examination; VT3 Mini","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

After the first two weeks in the season, 22 sub-elite football players completed either 10 weeks of intense intermittent training using the 10-20-30 training concept (10-20-30, n = 12) or sprint interval training (SIT, n = 10; work/rest ratio: 6-s/54-s) three times weekly, with a ~20% reduction in weekly training time. Before and after the intervention, players performed a Yo-Yo intermittent recovery test level 1 (Yo-Yo IR1) and a 30-m sprint test. Furthermore, players had a muscle biopsy taken from the vastus lateralis. Yo-Yo IR1 performance increased by 330 m (95%CI: 178-482, P ≤ 0.01) in 10-20-30, whereas no change was observed in SIT.

Muscle content of HADHA (24%, P ≤ 0.01), PDH-E1α (40%, P ≤ 0.01), complex I-V of the electron transport chain (ETC) (51%, P ≤ 0.01) and Na+ , K+ -ATPase subunits α2 (33%, P ≤ 0.05) and β1 (27%, P ≤ 0.05) increased in 10-20-30, whereas content of DHPR (27%, P ≤ 0.01) and complex I-V of the ETC (31%, P ≤ 0.05) increased in SIT. Intense intermittent training, combining short sprints and a high aerobic load, is superior to regular sprint interval training in increasing intense intermittent running performance during a Yo-Yo IR1 test and muscle content of PDH-E1α and HADHA in sub-elite football players.","2019","2020-05-20 00:26:10","2020-05-20 00:26:10","","669-677","","5","29","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L627312007; http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/sms.13395","adult; human; soccer; controlled study; athlete; young adult; physiology; running; randomized controlled trial; procedures; high intensity interval training; athletic performance; quadriceps femoris muscle; adaptation; muscle protein; myosin heavy chain","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

C.","In-season internal and external training load quantification of an elite European soccer team","PLoS ONE","","1932-6203","10.1371/journal.pone.0209393","","Elite soccer teams that participate in European competitions need to have players in the best physical and psychological status possible to play matches. As a consequence of congestive schedule, controlling the training load (TL) and thus the level of effort and fatigue of players to reach higher performances during the matches is therefore critical. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to provide the first report of seasonal internal and external training load that included Hooper Index (HI) scores in elite soccer players during an in-season period. Nineteen elite soccer players were sampled, using global position system to collect total distance, high-speed distance (HSD) and average speed (AvS). It was also collected session rating of perceived exertion (s-RPE) and HI scores during the daily training sessions throughout the 2015-2016 in-season period. Data were analysed across ten mesocycles (M: 1 to 10) and collected according to the number of days prior to a one-match week. Total daily distance covered was higher at the start (M1 and M3) compared to the final mesocycle (M10) of the season. M1 (5589m) reached a greater distance than M5 (4473m) (ES = 9.33 [12.70, 5.95]) and M10 (4545m) (ES = 9.84 [13.39, 6.29]). M3 (5691m) reached a greater distance than M5 (ES = 9.07 [12.36, 5.78]), M7 (ES = 6.13 [8.48, 3.79]) and M10 (ES = 9.37 [12.76, 5.98]). High-speed running distance was greater in M1 (227m), than M5 (92m) (ES = 27.95 [37.68, 18.22]) and M10 (138m) (ES = 8.46 [11.55, 5.37]). Interestingly, the s-RPE response was higher in M1 (331au) in comparison to the last mesocycle (M10, 239au). HI showed minor variations across mesocycles and in days prior to the match. Every day prior to a match, all internal and external TL variables expressed significant lower values to other days prior to a match (p<0.01). In general, there were no differences between player positions. Conclusions: Our results reveal that despite the existence of some significant differences between mesocycles, there were minor changes across the in-season period for the internal and external TL variables used. Furthermore, it was observed that MD-1 presented areduction of external TL (regardless of mesocycle) while internal TL variables did not have the same record during in-season match-day-minus.","2019","2020-05-20 00:26:12","2020-05-20 00:26:12","","","","4","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0209393; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2001862743","adult; human; human experiment; article; soccer player; exercise; workload; competition; running; velocity; fatigue; exercise test; athletic performance; global positioning system; statistical significance; European","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, it is necessary to ensure optimal match-day performance and full recovery. The aim of this study was to quantify internal and external training load (TL) within five microcycles: M1 and M2 – one-game weeks; M3 and M4 – two-game weeks; M5 – three-game week). Thirteen elite soccer players participated in this study. A global positioning system (GPS) was used to measure the total distance covered and distances of different exercise training zones (1–5), the session ratings of perceived exertion (s-RPE) scores and the amount of creatine kinase (CK) created during daily training sessions for the 2015–2016 in-season period. The data were analysed with respect to the number of days prior to a given match. The main results indicate that there was a significant difference in training intensity for zone 1 between M2 and M4 (4010.2 ± 103.5 and 4507.6 ± 133.0 m, respectively); a significant difference in training intensity for zone 3 between M1 and M5 (686.1 ± 42.8 and 801.2 ± 61.2 m, respectively); a significant difference in the duration of the training sessions and matches between M2 and M5 (69.2 ± 2.1 and 79.6 ± 2.3) and M3 and M5 (69.7 ± 1.0 and 79.6 ± 2.3); and finally, there was a significant difference in CK between M3 and M2 (325.5 ± 155.0 and 194.4 ± 48.9). Moreover, there was a significant decrease in TL in the last day prior to a match, for all microcycles and all variables. There was no significant difference with respect to s-RPE. This study provides the first report of daily external and internal TLs and weekly accumulated load (training sessions and match demands) during one, two, and three-game week schedules in a group of elite soccer players. Expected significant differences are found in daily and accumulated loads for within- and between-game schedules. A similar pattern is exhibited for one- and two-game week microcycles regarding the day before the match, which exhibits a decrease in all variables. Despite the different number of games played per week, TL remain similar between microcycles for zone 2 and 5, plus s-RPE.","2019","2020-05-20 00:26:13","2020-05-20 00:26:13","","146-156","","","201","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2018.11.036; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2001448209","adult; human; human experiment; male; article; soccer; soccer player; exercise; priority journal; training; longitudinal study; normal human; global positioning system; creatine kinase; quantitative analysis; game; European","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, the objective of this study was to compare HIE during pre-season, the first and second halves of the regular season, and playoffs in a sample of youth football players (n = 119, aged 9-13 years). Athletes were divided into one of four exposure groups based on quartiles computed from the distribution of risk-weighted cumulative exposure (RWECP). Mean impacts per session and mean 95th percentile linear and rotational acceleration in practices and games were compared across the four exposure groups and time frames using mixed effects models. Within games, the mean 95th percentile accelerations for the entire sample ranged from 47.2g and 2331.3 rad/sec2 during pre-season to 52.1g and 2533.4 rad/sec2 during the second half of regular season. Mean impacts per practice increased from pre-season to the second half of regular season and declined into playoffs among all exposure groups; however, the variation between time frames was not greater than two impacts per practice. Time of season had a significant relationship with mean 95th percentile linear and rotational acceleration in games (both, p = 0.01) but not with practice accelerations or impacts per session. The in-practice mean levels of 95th percentile linear and rotational acceleration remained fairly constant across the four time frames, but in games these changed over time depending on exposure group (interactions, p ≤ 0.05). The results of this study improve our understanding of in-season variations in HIE in youth football and may inform important opportunities for future interventions.","2019","2020-05-20 00:26:14","2020-05-20 00:26:14","","275-281","","2","36","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2018.5699; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L625792781","football player; human; article; acceleration; biomechanics; controlled study; major clinical study; season; juvenile; child; school child; group dynamics; head","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this study was to determine the incidence and nature of match ankle injuries in amateur U.S. Rugby-7s. Methods: This was a prospective epidemiology study of players at USA Rugby Club 7-a-side competitive regional circuits and USA Rugby-7s Championships (2010–2016). Match injury data and mechanisms were captured via the Rugby Injury Survey & Evaluation (RISE) Report. Incidence (per 1000 ph), proportion (%), and severity of injuries (days, d) were determined. Comparative analysis were performed with statistical significance set a p < 0.05. Results: Overall match ankle injuries were found at 9.9/1000 ph (n = 313) (time-loss 2.5/1000 ph, n = 78; medical attention 7.4/1000 ph, n = 235; p < 0.001). Females (3.5/1000 ph; 12.3%; n = 112) encountered fewer overall ankle injuries than males (7.6/1000 ph; 10.8%; n = 239; p < 0.001). Backs (59 %) were responsible for a greater proportion of ankle injuries than forwards (35 %). The overall mean ankle injury severity was 41.5 days (CI: 24.4-58.6) with 68% follow-up. The greatest severity for ankle injuries were among the College level competitors (105.6 d, P = 0.006). The majority of ankle injuries occurred during the tackle (61%, 5.2/1000 ph) and open play (29%, 2.5/1000 ph). In terms of mechanism of time-loss ankle injuries, direct-contact mechanisms resulted in 68% (1.7/1000 ph) of time-loss ankle injuries versus non-contact mechanisms (32%; 0.8/1000 ph; p = 0.002). The severity of contact versus non-contact ankle injuries did not differ (contact: 43.1 d; noncontact: 38.0 d). Most time-loss ankle injuries within the study period were new injuries (71.8 %) compared to recurrent time-loss ankle injuries (28.2 %). Recurrent ankle injuries occurred more frequently at greater-than-12-months (delayed recurrence: 12.8 %) followed by 2-month (early recurrence: 10.3 %) and 2-12 months (late recurrence: 5.1 %). Conclusions: Ankle injuries occur frequently among collision sports. Our amateur U.S. Rugby-7s population ankle injury rates (2.5/1000 ph) were lower than the incidence reported for International elite Rugby-7s play (time-loss: 7.1-25/1000 ph). The proportion of recurrent ankle injuries, particularly the early recurrence injuries, highlights the importance of post-tournament medical care and proper return to play protocols to minimize early ankle re-injury. Appropriate proprioception and agility training awareness would also benefit the U.S. population, particularly given the high proportion of recurrent ankle injuries that occurred in a delayed fashion.","2019","2020-05-20 00:26:17","2020-05-20 00:26:17","","S67","","","22","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsams.2019.08.273; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002914872","adult; conference abstract; human; rugby; controlled study; incidence; major clinical study; prospective study; follow up; agility; proprioception; awareness; injury severity; statistical significance; medical care; ankle injury; relapse","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Musculoskeletal complaints possibly mimicking some of these symptoms are common among elite athletes. This study aimed to determine seroprevalence and incidence of B. burgdorferi antibodies in professional football players. DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING: Healthy professional football players. PARTICIPANTS: Five hundred thirty-five men in the first and second German league. INTERVENTIONS: Two screening assays were used to examine immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) against B. burgdorferi: an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and a chemiluminescence assay (CLIA). In case of a positive or equivocal result, an immunoblot including in vivo antigens was performed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Course of IgM and IgG against B. burgdorferi in overall 1529 blood samples. RESULTS: A total of 96.4% of all results were concordant between EIA and CLIA. Considering only samples with identical results in both assays, prevalence was 1.6%. A positive IgM was detected in 2.3%. No player showed any symptoms of Lyme disease. A seroconversion to IgG was not found. Three players developed a positive IgM corresponding to an incidence of 1032/100 000 person-years. Depending on the assay, 49% to 75% of positive or equivocal screening results could not be confirmed by immunoblot. CONCLUSIONS: Seroprevalence and incidence of B. burgdorferi among healthy male professional football players are low. Therefore, infections with B. burgdorferi have to be regarded a rare differential diagnosis in professional football in Central Europe. The low confirmation rate of positive screening assays points to an unspecific immune activation.","2019","2020-05-20 00:26:18","2020-05-20 00:26:18","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/JSM.0000000000000758; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628516065","adult; football player; human; male; article; observational study; controlled study; incidence; major clinical study; prospective study; arthropathy; endogenous compound; Europe; differential diagnosis; screening test; antigen; carditis; chemoluminescence; enzyme immunoassay; immunoblotting; immunoglobulin G; immunoglobulin M; Lyme disease; seroconversion; seroprevalence","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With the newer generations of sand and rubber infill systems, infill weight is a common component that varies between fields. With the increasing concerns of rising medical costs, the potential for long-term articular changes, and perceived higher incidence of articular trauma while playing on artificial turf, infill weight could be a critical factor that could influence sport trauma and subsequent elective medical decisions. Therefore, this study quantified the incidence of game-related, high school football lower extremity and surface impact trauma requiring elective medical procedures across artificial turf systems of various infill weight. Methods: Artificial turf systems were divided into two sand/rubber infill weight groups by lbs per square foot: 6.0 to ≥9.0, and 0.0-5.9. Fifty-seven high schools participated across four states over 5 seasons. Outcomes of interest included elective medical procedures by injury category (player-turf surface impact trauma, trauma from shoe:surface interaction during physical collision/contact, trauma from shoe:surface interaction during physical noncontact). Data were subject to multivariate analyses of variance (MANOVA) and Wilks' λ criteria using general linear model procedures. Results: Of 1,837 games documented, 1,049 games were played on 6.0 to ≥9.0 lbs infill/sq. ft, and 788 on 0.0-5.9 lbs infill/sq. ft, with 4,655 total injuries reported. MANOVA indicated a significant main effect across elective medical procedures by injury category (F3,3977 = 16.574; P < .0001). Post hoc analyses indicated significantly lower injury incidence rates (IIR per 10 game season) requiring radiography and MRI procedures following player-turf surface impact trauma [1.7, (95% CI, 1.5-1.9) vs 3.2 (2.9-3.5); P = .001], trauma from shoe:surface interaction during physical collision/contact [2.4, (95% CI, 2.1-2.6) vs 3.2 (2.9-3.5); P = .001], and trauma from shoe:surface interaction during physical noncontact [0.4, (95% CI, 0.3-0.5) vs 0.7 (0.5-0.9); P = .01], while competing on the 6 to ≥9.0 lbs infill/sq. ft when compared to the lighter infill weight systems, respectively. No significant differences in surgical procedures by injury category were observed between infill weight. Conclusion: As the artificial infill surface weight decreased, the incidence of game-related, high school football lower extremity and surface impact trauma, and subsequent elective medical procedures significantly increased. Based on findings, high school football fields should minimally contain 6.0 to ≥9.0 lbs infill/sq. ft. This is the first longitudinal study to investigate the influence of artificial infill weight influence on high school sport trauma and elective medical decisions.","2019","2020-05-20 00:26:21","2020-05-20 00:26:21","","","","7","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2325967119S00411; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629238934","conference abstract; human; football; sport injury; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; controlled study; incidence; season; high school; longitudinal study; surgical technique; post hoc analysis; body weight loss; foot; multivariate analysis of variance; joint injury; radiography; rubber","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A total of 57 high schools in 4 states participated over the course of 5 seasons. Outcomes of interest included injury severity, as a function of infill weight, across head, knee, and shoulder traumas; injury category; primary type of injury; tissue type; specific body location of injury; cleat design; environmental factors; and turf age. Data were subject to multivariate analyses of variance (MANOVAs) and Wilks λ criteria through use of general linear model procedures. Results: Of 1837 games documented, 528 games were played on infill weights of ≥9.0 lb/ft2, 521 on 6.0-8.9 lb/ft2, 525 on 3.0-5.9 lb/ft2, and 263 on 0.0-2.9 lb/ft2, with 4655 total injuries reported. MANOVAs indicated significant infill weight effects across injury severity (F2,4648 = 5.087; P =.0001), with significant main effects also observed by injury category, tissue injured, lower extremity joint and muscle, cleat design, environmental factors, and turf age. Post hoc analyses indicated significantly lower (P <.05 to.0001) total and substantial traumas, concussions, shoe-surface interaction during contact trauma, surface impacts, muscle-tendon overload, cleat design influence, adverse weather trauma, lower extremity injuries, and turf age effect while athletes were competing on the 6.0 to ≥9.0 lb/ft2 infill weight systems compared with the lighter infill weight systems. Conclusion: As infill surface weight decreased, football trauma significantly increased across numerous playing conditions. Based on findings, high school football fields should minimally contain 6.0 pounds of infill per square foot.","2019","2020-05-20 00:26:25","2020-05-20 00:26:25","","","","3","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2325967119832878; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L626920573","football player; human; human experiment; male; article; sport injury; priority journal; incidence; athlete; cohort analysis; concussion; high school; outcome assessment; head injury; prevalence; normal human; fracture; anterior cruciate ligament injury; knee injury; leg injury; traumatic brain injury; body weight loss; shoulder injury; multicenter study; sports and sport related phenomena; tendon; injury severity; ankle injury; seasonal variation; grass; environmental factor; rubber; artificial turf surface; energy absorption; infill weight; injury scale; sand; tooth injury; weight; whiplash injury","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Participants (N=29) were randomly assigned to a LPJT group (n=13; age=13.0±0.7 years) using weighted vests or UPJT group (n=16; age=13.0±0.5 years) using body mass only. Before and after the intervention, tests for the assessment of proxies of muscle power (i.e., countermovement-jump [CMJ], standing-long-jump [SLJ]), speed (i.e., 5-m, 10-m, and 20-m sprint), change-of-direction (i.e., Illinois change-of-direction test [ICoDT], modified 505 agility test), and kicking-distance test were conducted. Data were analysed using magnitude-based inferences. RESULTS: Within-group analyses for the LPJT group showed large and very large improvements for 10-m sprint-time (effect size [ES]=2.00) and modified 505 CoD (ES=2.83) tests, respectively. For the same group, moderate improvements were observed in ICoDT (ES=0.61), 5- and 20-m sprint-time (ES=1.00 for both tests), CMJ (ES=1.00) and MKD (ES=0.90). Small enhancements in the SLJ (ES=0.50) test were apparent. Regarding the UPJT group, small improvements were observed for all tests (ES=0.33 to 0.57) except 5-m and 10-m sprint-time (ES=1.00 and 0.63, respectively). Between-group analyses favored the LPJT group for the modified 505 CoD (ES=0.61), SLJ (ES=0.50), and MKD (ES=0.57) tests, but not for 5-m sprint-time (ES=1.00). Only trivial between-group differences were shown for the remaining tests (ES=0.00 to 0.09). CONCLUSION: Overall, LPJT appears to be more effective than UPJT in improving measures of muscle power, speed, change-of-direction and kicking-distance performance in prepubertal male soccer players.","2019","2020-05-20 00:26:27","2020-05-20 00:26:27","","1-25","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1123/ijspp.2018-0866; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L627870454","human; human experiment; male; article; football; soccer player; clinical article; controlled study; training; adolescent; randomized controlled trial; muscle strength; agility; effect size; athletic performance; maturity; Illinois","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The authors examined active professional American football players over a 6-year time period to study potential TAI after concussion and assess optimal methods to analyze DTI at the individual level. METHODS: Active American professional football players recruited prospectively were assessed with DTI, conventional MRI, and standard clinical workup. Subjects underwent an optional preseason baseline scan and were asked to undergo a scan within 5 days of concussion during gameplay. DTI from 25 age- and sex-matched controls were obtained. Both semiautomated region-of-interest analysis and fully automated tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) were used to examine DTI at individual and group levels. Statistical differences were assessed comparing individual DTI data to baseline imaging versus a normative database. Group-level comparisons were also performed to determine if longer exposure to professional-level play or prior concussion cause white matter microstructural integrity changes. RESULTS: Forty-nine active professional football players were recruited into the study. Of the 49 players, 7 were assessed at baseline during the preseason and after acute concussion. An additional 18 players were assessed after acute concussion only. An additional 24 players had only preseason baseline assessments. The results suggest DTI is more sensitive to suspected TAI than conventional MRI, given that 4 players demonstrated decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) in multiple tracts despite normal conventional MRI. Furthermore, the data suggest individual assessment of DTI data using baseline premorbid imaging is more sensitive than typical methods of comparing data to a normative control group. Among all subjects with baseline data, 1 reduced FA tract (± 2.5 standard deviations) was found using the typical normative database reference versus 10 statistically significant (p < 0.05) reduced FA tracts when referencing internal control baseline data. All group-level comparisons were statistically insignificant (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Baseline premorbid DTI data for individual DTI analysis provides increased statistical sensitivity. Specificity using baseline imaging also increases because numerous potential etiologies for reduced FA may exist prior to a concussion. These data suggest that there is a high potential for false-positive and false-negative assessment of DTI data using typical methods of comparing an individual to normative groups given the variability of FA values in the normal population.","2019","2020-05-20 00:26:33","2020-05-20 00:26:33","","1-9","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.3171/2019.3.JNS181864; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629244814","adult; female; football player; human; male; article; controlled study; prospective study; concussion; diffusion tensor imaging; traumatic brain injury; axonal injury; fractional anisotropy; corona radiata (brain); neurology; protein kinase p60; uncinate fasciculus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A previous study showing that only 10 compete ruptures occurred in the NFL between the years 2000-2010. The purpose of the study is to report the incidence of pectoralis ruptures in National Football League (NFL) players from 2010-2017 and identify any characteristics that could have contributed. We hypothesized that incidence of pectoralis major ruptures would increase over the past eight years. Methods: Using publicly available reports from websites such as ESPN.com and NFL.com, pectoralis major injuries in professional football players were identified during the years 2010-2017. Details about age, position played, injury setting, performance enhancing drug (PED) suspensions, and combine performance were obtained from NFL Combine and compared to peers at the same workout. Results: During the eight years analyzed 51 separate NFL players suffered a total of 55 pectoralis major ruptures. Defensive players accounted for 82% (42 of 51) of the injured players. The ruptures happened at the average age of 26±1 years, and 76.4% (42 of 55) of them occurred during games. After the rupture, 87.3% (48 of 55) required surgery, while definitive treatment could not be determined for the remaining seven injuries. For athletes that received playing time before injury and had their rupture occur prior to the most recent 2017 season, 85.4% (41 of 48) returned to play in a game. When comparing athletes at the combine who later ruptured their pectoralis major to peers at their position, those who tore their pectoralis major tendon on-average ranked in the 63rd percentile for bench press (N=40), 50th percentile for arm length (N=14), and 52nd percentile for 20-yard shuttle (N=20). When the NFL suspension records were examined, only 5.9% (3 of 51) of players with a pectoralis major rupture had been suspended for (performance-enhancing drug) PED use before or after the injury. Conclusion: The total number of pectoralis major ruptures has drastically risen from 10 cases between 2000-2010 to 55 cases from 2010-2017. The reason behind this increase remain uncertain but appears to be independent of relative strength, agility, and arm length, and suspension for PED use.","2019","2020-05-20 00:26:34","2020-05-20 00:26:34","","","","7","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2325967119S00396; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629239554","adult; conference abstract; football player; human; rupture; controlled study; incidence; major clinical study; season; agility; tendon; performance enhancing substance; suspension","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

RSNM enables personalized targeting of focal neuromodulation techniques such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). rTMS is believed to exert antidepressant efficacy by modulating connectivity between the stimulation site, the default mode network (DMN), and the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC). Personalized rTMS may be particularly useful after repetitive traumatic brain injury (TBI), which is associated with neurodegenerative tauo-pathy in medial temporal limbic structures. These degenerative changes are believed to be related to treatment-resistant neurobehavioral disturbances observed in many retired athletes. Methods: The authors describe a case in which RSNM was successfully used to target rTMS to treat these neuropsychiatric disturbances in a retired NFL defensive lineman whose symptoms were not responsive to conventional treatments. RSNM was used to identify left-right dorsolateral prefrontal rTMS targets with maximal difference between dorsal attention network and DMN correlations. These targets were spatially distinct from those identified by prior methods. Twenty sessions of left-sided excitatory and right-sided inhibitory rTMS were administered at these targets. Results: Treatment led to improvement in Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (72%), cognitive testing, and headache scales scores. Compared with healthy individuals and subjects with TBI-associated depression, baseline rsfMRI revealed substantially elevated DMN connectivity with the medial temporal lobe (MTL). Serial rsfMRI scans revealed gradual improvement in MTL-DMN connectivity and stimulation site connectivity with sgACC. Conclusions: These results highlight the possibility of individualized neuromodulation and biomarker-based monitoring for neuropsychiatric sequelae of repetitive TBI.","2019","2020-05-20 00:26:37","2020-05-20 00:26:37","","254-263","","3","31","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1176/appi.neuropsych.18100230; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002254954","adult; football player; human; male; article; case report; clinical article; priority journal; controlled study; cognition; traumatic brain injury; depression; headache; mental disease; functional magnetic resonance imaging; treatment outcome; anterior cingulate; brain mapping; connectome; default mode network; dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; medial temporal lobe; Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale; repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation; resting state network mapping","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

All players undertook a maximal running speed test to determine the maximal acceleration. Players' activities during the matches were classified into four individual acceleration thresholds: acceleration starting from 0 to 13 km·h-1 and never reaching 18 km·h-1 (A1); acceleration starting from 0 to 13 km·h-1 and reaching 18 km·h-1 (A2); acceleration starting from 13 to 18 km·h-1 (A3); and acceleration starting above 18 km·h-1 (A4). During A1, Full-Backs performed a higher number of accelerations compared to other playing positions and reached a ~95% of the maximum acceleration. During A2, Full-Backs and Wide Midfielder performed a higher number of accelerations than Central Defenders and Forwards, and Central Midfielders reached an estimated intensity of 95% of the maximum acceleration. During A3, CM performed the highest number of accelerations compared to the rest of the groups, while F reached an estimated intensity of 78% of their maximum acceleration. This individualized threshold could help coaches assess players' physical performance and improve it, or to avoid injuries. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR El objetivo del presente estudio fue analizar el número, % de la aceleración máxima y la distancia recorrida por las diferentes posiciones de juego, clasificándolos según un umbral individual para cada jugador basado en la máxima capacidad de aceleraración usando la tecnología GPS. Un total de 20 jugadores fueron evaluados durante 4 partidos (n=80). Todos los participantes realizaron un sprint a la máxima velocidad de carrera para determinar su capacidad máxima de aceleración. La actividad de los jugadores durante los partidos fue dividida en 4 categorías individuales de aceleración: A1, aceleración de 0 a 13 km·h-1 y sin llegar a 18 km·h-1; A2, aceleración desde 0 hasta 13 km·h-1 y alcanzando 18 km·h-1; A3, aceleración que inicia desde los 13 km·h-1 hasta los 18 km·h-1; A4, aceleración que comienza a una velocidad >18 km·h-1. En A1, los defensas laterales realizaron un mayor número de aceleraciones en comparación con las otras demarcaciones de juego y logrando una intensidad ~ 95% de su aceleración máxima. En A2, los defensas laterales y centrocampistas laterales realizaron un mayor número de aceleraciones que los defensas centrales y delanteros, consiguiendo los centrocampistas una intensidad aproximada del 95% de su máxima aceleración. En A3, los centrocampistas realizaron una cantidad superior de aceleraciones que el resto de grupos, mientras que los delanteros lograron una intensidad aproximada del 78% de su máxima aceleración. Estos umbrales individualizados podrían ser de gran utilidad para permitir evaluar a los técnicos de forma más precisa el rendimiento físico de los jugadores, permitiéndoles con ello mejorar su rendimiento y prevenir lesiones en futbolistas.

While coaches represent the best option to facilitate PTPs long term, it is unknown how to best train coaches to ensure effective PTP implementation behavior. In other areas of health behavior research, education strategies tailored specifically to an individual's needs and interests increase the likelihood of adopting a given behavior. To encourage youth sport coaches to implement PTPs, it may be beneficial to tailor workshops. One way to gauge the impact of an education strategy is to look at end-user outcomes. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate changes in athlete injury risk, as measured by the Landing Error Scoring System (LESS), between adolescent basketball and soccer athletes whose coach attended a General pre-season education workshop on PTP implementation compared to a Tailored pre-season education workshop. Methods: A cluster randomized control trial was utilized. Youth soccer and basketball organizations were contacted to participate in a pre-season coaches' education workshop on PTP implementation. Organizations were randomized into either a General or Tailored workshop. All participating coaches within a given organization attended the same workshop. General workshops contained standardized content including: youth sport injury epidemiology, injury rate and risk reduction benefits of PTPs, and hands-on instruction on how to implement a PTP. Coaches in Tailored workshops completed pre-workshop surveys. The pre-workshop survey contained Likert-style questions on knowledge of and experience with implementing PTPs. Researchers used the results to prioritize and inform content emphasis within the Tailored workshop. For example, if an organization had a high frequency of coaches who reported that they were particularly interested in the sport performance benefits of PTPs, the research team would devote increased time to discussing that particular component. Both the General and Tailored workshop were approximately 1-hour in length but varied in the amount of time spent on different topic areas. Athletes completed a PRE and POST season baseline assessment of injury risk. The injury risk assessment included three trials of a jump-landing task that was evaluated using the Landing Error Scoring System (LESS). The LESS is a valid and reliable clinical movement assessment used to identify high-risk movement patterns during a jump-landing task. LESS scores are based on observable errors, where a higher score indicates a greater number of movement errors and an increased risk of sustaining a lower extremity injury. To complete the task, participants jumped off a 30-cm high box to a distance half of their height and immediately rebounded straight in the air for maximum vertical height. A single, reliable rater graded all trials for PRE and POST. All three trials were averaged together for one composite LESS score at each time point. A mixed model analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to evaluate differences in composite LESS score over time (PRE, POST) between educational workshops (General, Tailored). All data were analyzed using SPSS Version 21.0 with an a priori alpha level of p<0.05. Results: Seventy-seven athletes on 9 teams across 6 different organizations (Coaches' Workshops: General=5 teams from 4 organizations; Tailored=4 teams from 2 organizations) completed both PRE and POST testing sessions. There were no significant differences between workshop (General, Tailored) and LESS scores at POST (P>0.05). Regardless of workshop LESS scores improved over time ((Mean±SD [95%CI]) Generalized PRE: 5.46±0.10 [4.84, 6.08], Generalized POST: 4.62±0.10 [4.00, 5.25], Tailored PRE: 5.99±0.09[5.40, 6.59], Tailored POST: 5.66±0.09[5.06, 6.25])(P=0.03). Conclusions: Regardle s of coaches' educational workshop strategy, athletes improved movement technique from PRE to POST across a single sport season. These findings suggest that any level of exposure to PTP-related content could have beneficial downstream effects for the end user, or in this case reduced injury risk for youth athletes. Future studies should look to evaluate the content of pre-season coach education workshops in conjunction with tracking fidelity of program delivery in order to optimize efforts to disseminate and implement PTPs for youth sport coaches.

In order to accomplish the research objectives, three tests for vertical jump assessment were applied: squat jump (SJ), countermovement jump (CMJ), and countermovement jump with arm swing (CMJA). The experimental program was applied within a period of six working weeks with four trainings per week. The trainings were applied with a circular method of work, and the respondents were divided into groups, each of two players. The results of the study suggest that the six-week experimental training program of functional training positively affected the improvement of the average results in the three tests. On the basis of the numerical values of the arithmetic means and the percentage differences, one can conclude that during the period of six weeks, in the entire sample of respondents there was an improvement of 18.20% in the Squat Jump test, the improvement in the Countermovement Jump test was 8.99%, and in the Countermovement Jump With Arm Swing test an improvement of 18.59% was achieved.

These different phenotypes are related through the complex interaction between the environment and the individual genetic profile. The hypothesis is that there is a hereditary component that interferes in physical fitness. ACE stands out among the genes that may influence this response. Objectives: The objective of this study is to analyze the polymorphism of the ACE gene in American football athletes. Methods: At the end of the study, the sample was composed of 45 male athletes and 72 non-athletes. DNA was extracted from the jugal mucosa. ACE polymorphisms were genotyped through polymerase chain reaction and analyzed using the electrophoresis process. To compare the frequency of genotypes between athletes and the control group, we used the Chi-square test. The association between the frequencies of alleles was verified through the 2X2 contingency tables analyzed using the Chi-square test with Yates correction. The type of study was diagnostic - Investigation of a diagnostic test, level of evidence II. A p-value of ≤0.05 was considered statistically significant for all the analyses. Results: The results showed a greater frequency of the D allele in American football athletes when compared with non-athletes, and a significant difference in the genotypic distribution of the athletes being composed of a higher number of the DD genotype as compared to the control group. Conclusion: The study provides evidence of the allelic and genotypic influence of ACE polymorphism in amateur American football players in Brazil.

J Strength Cond Res 33(11): 3078-3084, 2019-The aim of this study was to examine the influence of biological maturity on match performance in elite, youth, male soccer players. The participants were 80 Premier League Academy outfield players (8-16 years old). Biological maturity was determined by calculating estimated chronological age at peak height velocity. The U9 and U10 squads played 6-a-side and the U11-U16 squads played 11-a-side interacademy matches. All matches were analyzed using a 1-Hz global positioning system (SPI Elite™, GPSports, Canberra, Australia) with squad-specific speed zones, which were calculated based on 5-m flying sprint speed in the last 5 m of 10-m sprint test. In the U9/U10s, earlier maturers were given a longer pitch time by coaches (∼4 minutes per match; p = 0.029) and covered a greater total distance (∼9%; ∼400 m; p = 0.037) and a greater distance by walking (∼13%; ∼100 m; p = 0.024) and jogging (∼12%; ∼200 m; p = 0.014) during a match compared with later maturers. In the U13/U14s, earlier maturers covered a greater distance per hour of a match by high-speed running compared with later maturers (∼25%; ∼130 m; p = 0.028) and spent a longer percentage of time in high-speed running during a match compared with later maturers (3.4% vs. 2.7%, p = 0.034). Thus, coaches should take care to provide all players with a similar pitch time and should be aware in the talent identification and development process, particularly with the U13/U14 age group, because maturity can influence high-speed match running performance.","2019","2020-05-20 00:26:46","2020-05-20 00:26:46","","3078-3084","","11","33","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1519/JSC.0000000000002510; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629684279","human; male; soccer; adolescent; geographic information system; physiology; running; walking; child; aptitude; athletic performance; adolescent development; child development","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Two 7-a-side balanced competitive teams received instructions regarding the rules of the small-sided games proposed. Additionally, one team received instructions from the coach regarding the collective tactical behaviour required for each exercise condition: (a) Without strategic instruction (WSI); (b) Defensive strategy (DS); (c) Offensive strategy (OS) to play against the team that only received the rules of the small-sided games. The comparisons among game scenarios were assessed via standardised mean differences. The comparison between WSI and DS revealed higher number of defensive actions, less space covered, and more distance covered in jogging for DS in comparison with WSI. The comparison between WSI and OS revealed more passes per ball possession, larger team length, larger space covered, lower distance covered walking, and more distance covered in jogging for OS in comparison with WSI. The results reinforce that coaches' previous instruction constrains the technical, tactical, and physical demands of small-sided games in football. The use of previous instruction regarding strategical and tactical behaviour allows highlighting the players' behaviour and ensures functional team performance.

J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2019-The aim of this study was to quantify the acute impact of bout duration and individual interaction space on physical and physiological demands and on physical performance. Ten young male soccer players (age: 14.8 ± 0.6 years) from the same team playing in the National U-16 Division participated. Physical (total distance [TD]; distance covered at different speeds; and maximum velocity [Velmax]) and physiological (peak [HRpeak] and mean [HRmean] heart rate) parameters were collected for every bout during each small-sided game (SSG) format. Moreover, the effects of SSGs on horizontal jump (HJ) and 30-m sprint performances were evaluated. The SSG formats were composed of 6 players a side (including goalkeepers) and included 4 repetitions of 6 minutes in a space of 100 m (SSG1) or 200 m (SSG2) and 6 repetitions of 4 minutes in 100 m (SSG3) or 200 m (SSG4). The TD, the distance covered at different speeds, and Velmax were greater (p < 0.01, effect size [ES] = 1.25-5.95, large) in SSG2 and SSG4 than SSG1 and SSG3, respectively. Furthermore, the HRmean and HRpeak were lower (p < 0.05, ES = 1.53-2.23, large) during SSG3 than other SSGs. In addition, while a significant (p < 0.05, ES = 0.70-2.04, moderate to large) increase in SPR30 time in SSG1 and SSG3 was observed, HJ performance was not affected (p > 0.05, ES = 0.03-0.54, trivial to moderate) by any SSG format. These findings suggest increasing pitch size to induce greater physical demands and to use SSGs with smaller pitch size, and independently of the bout duration, to induce neuromuscular fatigue.","2019","2020-05-20 00:26:48","2020-05-20 00:26:48","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1519/JSC.0000000000003114; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L627046398","human; male; article; soccer player; heart rate; controlled study; physical performance; adolescent; velocity; effect size; pitch; muscle weakness","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The players participated in fifteen matches using the 1-3-3 system and another fifteen using the 1-2-3-1 system, each match lasting twenty five minutes. Maximum heart rate (HRmax) and average heart rate(HRavg) were registered (absolute and relative) and so were the following physical variables: total distance, distance covered in different speed ranges, sprint characteristics, number of accelerations/decelerations during the different ranges of intensity and the indicators of global load (work-rest ratio, maximum speed and Effindex). In both of the game play systems studied (1-3-3 and 1-2-3-1) similar results were obtained in all the physical variables. However the time that the players spent over 90% of HRmax (6.86% vs. 3.17%) were significantly (p=0.015) higher in the 1- 3-3 system than in the 1-2-3-1 system. It is also worth noting that the distance covered in the last 5 minutes of the game was significantly (p<0.01) lower than the distances covered in the first four periods of five minutes in both of the game systems. Knowing the demands of competition is the basis on which specific training for each sport is based. In this sense it is necessary to undertake further investigations that provide precise data on the demands (load) in each specialization, not only among the elite, but also in inferior categories.

However, the continued high incidence of concussion in American football, has led researchers to investigate novel helmet liner strategies. These strategies typically supplement existing technologies by adding or integrating head-helmet decoupling mechanisms. Decoupling strategies aim to redirect or redistribute impact force around the head, reducing impact energy transferred to the brain. This results in decreased brain tissue strain, which is beneficial in injury risk reduction due to the link between tissue strain and concussive injury. The purpose of this study was to mathematically demonstrate the effect of ten cases, representing theoretical redirection and redistribution helmet liner strategies, on brain tissue strain resulting from impacts to the head. The kinematic response data from twenty head impacts collected in the laboratory was mathematically modified to represent the altered response of the ten different cases and used as input parameters to determine the effect on maximum principal strain (MPS) values, calculated using finite element modeling. The results showed that a reduced dominant coordinate component (contributes the greatest to resultant) of rotational acceleration decreased maximum principal strain in American football helmets. The study theoretically demonstrates that liner strategies, if applied correctly, can influence brain motion, reduce brain tissue strain, and could decrease injury risk in an American football helmet.","2019","2020-05-20 00:26:51","2020-05-20 00:26:51","","1047-1060","","13","22","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10255842.2019.1626840; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628205108","article; football; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; brain concussion; priority journal; helmet; head injury; traumatic brain injury; computer assisted tomography; brain tissue; finite element analysis; risk reduction; cerebrospinal fluid; computer model; energy transfer; mathematical phenomena","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Studies have reported variation in rugby union injury incidence rates depending on different time-loss injury definitions. However, the influence of a non-severe medical-attention definition of injuries on injury incidence rates remains unknown. Further, associations between global positioning systems (GPS) derived workloads and injury incidence are yet to be investigated. Therefore, the aims of this study are to document differences in injury incidence according to injury definition, and investigate associations between injuries, weekly workloads, and the acute:chronic workload ratio across a competitive season in senior university rugby union players. Methods: Thirty senior grade players (mean?standard deviation; age, 22.3?1.8 years; body mass, 100.4?13.4 kg) from a university club were recruited. Player workload (eg distance, decelerations) and collisions were measured using GPS devices (SPI HPU 5 Hz (interpolated to 10 Hz), GPSports Systems, Canberra, Australia). Contact and non-contact injuries were recorded by club medical personnel and classified as medical-attention with no time-loss (NTL) or medical-attention with time-loss (TL), with total medical-attention (MA) as the sum of all injuries. Acute (1 week):chronic (previous 4 weeks) workloads were categorised into quartiles: low, < 25 %; low-moderate, 25–50%; moderate-high, 50–75 %; high > 75 %. Results: Match injury incidence was 152.1 injuries/1000 player hours (PH) (backs = 143.9, forwards = 160.8) for MA, 72.2 injuries/1000 PH (backs = 77.5, forwards = 66.7) for NTL, and 79.8 injuries/1000 PH (backs = 66.4, forwards = 94.1) for TL injuries. The risk of contact MA injuries significantly increased with all categories of collisions, while the risk of NTL injuries decreased with moderate-low (OR 0.1, 95 %CI: 0.0–0.7, p = 0.018) and moderate-high (OR 0.2, 95 %CI: 0.0–0.7, p = 0.02) chronic collisions compared to the low-workload reference. Players with high chronic distance (OR: 31.1, 95 %CI: 1.7–562.9, p = 0.02) exhibited an increased risk of non-contact MA injuries. Players with high chronic total decelerations exhibited a decreased injury risk for non-contact MA injuries (OR 0.04, 95 %CI: 0.0–0.8, p = 0.032), and an increased risk of non-contact TL injuries (OR 5.0, 9 %CI: 1.0–24.5, p = 0.047) compared to the low-load reference. No significant associations were observed between any injury classifications and the acute:chronic workload ratio. Discussion: Overall, forwards have a higher injury incidence than backs, and sustain more severe TL injuries than backs. However, backs sustain more less-severe NTL injuries than forwards. Associations between workload variables and injuries vary with injury classification. Practitioners should take caution when defining injuries for injury-workload studies in rugby union.

Thirty-six under-15 national level football players participated in this study and performed atotal of 15,067 tactical actions. They performed four SSCG bouts with 4 minutes of passive recovery between each bout, in two experimental conditions: free-play SSCG and two-touch SSCG. Tactical behaviour and performance were analysed using the System of Tactical Assessment in Soccer and the Social Network Analysis, was used to measure players' interactions. Results showed that two-touch SSCG increased the frequency of actions of width and length without the ball (p = 0.001), depth mobility (p = 0.029), concentration (p = 0.001), and defensive unity (p = 0.001). The two-touch format also increased defensive performance (p = 0.005), density (p = 0.001), and clustering coefficient (p = 0.007). Therefore, coaches should adopt the two-touch rule for increasing ball circulation or to reduce the tactical complexity of the task for the defending team.

"4E8BA5RE","journalArticle","2019","Smith, Graham","'The influence of overseas coaching and management on the occupational subculture of English professional soccer: views from the dugout'","Soccer & Society","","14660970","","","It is generally acknowledged that expatriate British players and coaches were instrumental in soccer's radiant global diffusion and that different technical and tactical emphases developed according to particular geographical locations and cultural milieu. As the twentieth century unfolded, the trend reversed with increased inward flows of elite foreign playing and coaching labour challenging the distinctive and erstwhile dominant occupational culture of the English game. This paper explores the dynamics and tensions of subcultural modification and adaptation at the British: migrant coaching talent interface. Owing to issues associated with access, the occupational subculture of elite-level football is impenetrable to most researchers. Previous employment in professional soccer allowed this author to overcome such impediments, permitting access to a range of high-status national and international players and coaches (n = 25) affecting and affected by occupational subcultural change. This enabled a distinctive research platform combining insider knowledge and grounded experience with academic orthodoxy. The paper is built upon primary data collected in semi-structured interviews and critical analysis of emerging themes. In doing so, it offers a fresh dimension to understanding the impact of globalization on elite professional English soccer. Key findings indicated the opinion of British coaches on the impact of this foreign influx polarized. Although many demonstrated an enlightened standpoint, adopting innovative practices introduced by overseas coaching talent, these views were counter-balanced by evidence of a myopic arrogance bordering on xenophobic resistance to change in what now has to be considered the global rather than the 'English' game.

Methods: Forty-four professional AF players participated in this study. Sixty-nine pre-season training and in-season match profiles were monitored using global positioning system (GPS) microtechnology and technical statistics across two seasons. Technical performance was measured as the Player Rank score provided by Champion Data. Players were divided into three equal training load groups based on total distance accumulated during pre-season. Results: Players in the high training load (HTL) group performed more relative total and high-speed distance in matches compared with the moderate (MTL; ES = 0.73–0.86) and low (LTL; ES = 0.68–1.31) training load groups, with the differences becoming greater as the season progressed. There were no clear differences in Player Rank score between groups. There were positive relationships between pre-season high-speed running and match relative distance (p = 0.001; r = 0.417; r2 = 0.174) and match relative high-speed running (p = 0.001; r = 0.561; r2 = 0.314), which were greatest in the HTL group. Conclusions: High pre-season training loads are associated with increased physical match activities, but do not appear to impact technical performance.

The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of situational variables on ball possession in the PSL. Thirty-two matches played during the 2016–2017 PSL season were analysed using a multiple-camera match analysis system (InStat®). Three situational variables (match outcome, match location, and quality of opposition) and team performance variables (percentage of ball possession, ball possession <5 s, ball possession 5–15 s, ball possession 15–45 s, and ball possession >45 s) were examined. The results showed that losing teams had the highest ball possession (52.35 ± 5.90%) compared to winning (47.65 ± 5.90%) and drawing (50.00 ± 9.98%) teams. Playing away significantly (p < 0.05) decreased ball possession by 5.21% compared to playing at home. Playing against weak opposition was associated with increased ball possession by 4.09%. Conclusively, soccer coaches should be aware of the potential role of situational variables in determining successful team performance in a league season.

Seventy-eight elite athletes (soccer, n = 46; rugby, n = 32) performed the following assessments: squat and countermovement jumps (SJ and CMJ), 1 repetition-maximum in the half-squat exercise (HS 1RM), peak power (PP) in the jump-squat exercise, and 20-m linear sprint and Zigzag COD tests. Utilizing the median split analysis, athletes were divided into two groups according to their HS 1RM and PP JS (e.g., higher and lower HS 1RM and higher and lower PP JS). The magnitude-based inference method was used to analyze the differences between groups in the physical performance tests. Athletes in the high strength and power groups outperformed their weaker and less powerful counterparts in all speed and power measurements (i.e., 5-, 10-, and 20-m sprint velocity, Zigzag COD speed, and CMJ and SJ height). In contrast, stronger and more powerful athletes displayed greater COD deficits. The present data indicate that players with superior strength-power capacity tend to be less efficient at changing direction, relative to maximum sprinting speed, despite being faster in linear trajectories. From these results, it appears that current strength and power training practices in team-sports are potentially not the ""most appropriate"" to increase the aptitude of a given athlete to efficiently utilize his/her neuromuscular abilities during COD maneuvers. Nevertheless, it remains unknown whether more multifaceted training programs are effective in decreasing COD deficits.

Nevertheless, the interaction effect of sports surfaces on this ability remains unknown. This research aimed to analyze the plantar pressures and time performance of 15 youth futsal players when performing CODs on two playing surfaces with different mechanical properties. The shock absorption and vertical deformation of one synthetic flooring surface and one wooden flooring surface were assessed. CODs were evaluated using a modified version of the Agility T-Test, while total time of the test, time of CODs, and plantar pressure in CODs were all recorded. The wooden flooring surface displayed higher values of shock absorption (35.70 ± 2.87%) and vertical deformation (2.77 ± 0.38 mm) compared with the synthetic flooring (p <0.01). Faster CODs were performed on the wooden flooring than on the synthetic flooring (-0.05 s, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.10 to -0.007, effect size [ES]: 0.07, p <0.05), but no differences in total test time were found (p >0.05). Finally, no differences in plantar pressures by playing surface were found. In sum, the differences in the mechanical properties of the two futsal surfaces affected the performance of futsal players in the modified agility test. However, these differences were not great enough to generate different plantar pressures on players, probably due to playerś own adaptations.","2019","2020-05-20 00:27:02","2020-05-20 00:27:02","","1-24","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17461391.2019.1677780; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629537606","human; article; controlled study; sport; juvenile; agility; effect size","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: Twenty-seven professional rugby union players performed CMJ, single-leg balance and landing tests on a 1000 Hz force plate at the beginning and end of training days. Training load was described by session RPE, Banister's TRIMP, GPS total distance, high-speed running distance (>5.5 m s−1), relative speed and body load. Results: CMJ eccentric rate of force development (EccRFD) demonstrated moderate impairment post-training (ES ± 90%CL = −0.79 ± 0.29, MBI = almost certainly). CMJ height (−0.21 ± 0.16, possible), concentric impulse (ConIMP) (−0.35 ± 0.17, likely) and single-leg balance sway velocity on the non-dominant leg (0.30 ± 0.26, possible) were also impaired. Regression analyses identified the strongest relationship between sRPE and impaired ConIMP (r = −0.68 ± 21, β = −0.68) whilst other load measures explained 27–50% of the variance in balance and CMJ changes. Conclusions: CMJ variables representing altered movement strategy (EccRFD and IMP) may be useful for assessing acute neuromuscular fatigue in rugby union, though single-leg balance sway velocity may be an alternative when maximal tests are impractical.

Soccer players perform many actions with one limb, like stop and turn and kicking a ball. A large number of repetitions could create limb asymmetries. Aim of Study. The aims of the present study were to quantify limb asymmetries from unilateral three kinds of jumps (single-leg countermovement jump -- SLCMJ, single-leg long jump -- SLLJ, and single-leg triple jump -- SLTJ) and examine their effects on acceleration (10 m sprint test) and on speed (20 m sprint test) in two different age groups. Material and Methods. Two groups (U10 (9.9 ± 0.3 yrs) and U15 (14.6 ± 0.8 yrs)) of nineteen youth male soccer players each, performed an SLCMJ, SLLJ, SLTJ, and a 20 m sprint test. A paired samples T-test was used to compare the two limbs. Pearson's correlations were used to investigate the relationships between limb asymmetries and performance on acceleration and speed. Results. In U10 group, SLCMJ height asymmetry (p < 0.05) showed no association with acceleration and speed. However, SLTJ (p < 0.05) asymmetries were associated with slower acceleration times (p < 0.05). Also, SLLJ asymmetries correlated with a lower speed at the 20 m sprint test (p < 0.05). In U15 group, SLCMJ height asymmetry (p < 0.05) showed no association with acceleration and speed. Conclusions. The results from this study highlight that the SLTJ and SLCMJ could be used for identifying limb asymmetries in U10 and U15, respectively.

Influence of well-being indices and recovery state on the technical and physiological aspects of play during small-sided games. J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2019-Soccer players performing at high level are frequently exposed to periods of intense training, which can induce substantial stress and fatigue. These high-intensity stimuli are likely lead to a lower state of well-being and poor recovery and, consequently, may affect players' performance. This study aimed to assess the influence of well-being indices (i.e., self-ratings of sleep, stress, fatigue, and delayed onset muscle soreness [DOMS]) and the total quality of recovery (TQR) on technical and physiological measures during soccer small-sided games (SSGs). Twenty male professional soccer players (age: 25.1 ± 1.0 years) performed four 25-minute SSG sessions. Well-being indices were collected before each SSG-session. Heart rate was continuously measured throughout each session, and the ratings of perceived exertion and blood lactate concentration were collected after each SSG. A hierarchical cluster analysis was performed across variables and cases to identify associations between variables and variability in players' responses between sessions. No significant correlations were found between well-being indices, TQR and physiological parameters. Total quality recovery was positively correlated with successful pass % (r = 0.27) and interceptions (r = 0.25) and negatively correlated with lost balls (r = -0.25). Fatigue and DOMS were negatively correlated with tackles (r = -0.29, r = -0.28, respectively), successful pass % (r = -0.58, r = -0.55, respectively) and interceptions (r = -0.25, r = -0.27, respectively), and positively correlated with lost balls (r = 0.32, r = 0.28, respectively). Results provide an alternative and complementary method to understand training responses and can be an objective tool to help create subgroups in training for optimizing performance. This study demonstrates the efficacy and utility of using simple well-being and recovery measures to help coaches monitor athlete readiness.","2019","2020-05-20 00:27:06","2020-05-20 00:27:06","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1519/JSC.0000000000003228; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629064975","adult; human; male; article; soccer player; exercise; heart rate; fatigue; cluster analysis; human tissue; stress; lactate blood level; wellbeing; muscle; sleep; stimulus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Whole-body electrostimulation (WB-EMS) has been shown to improve maximum strength, sprinting and jumping performance, and to increase deformability in elite soccer players during the season. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether WB-EMS affects RBC turnover which might affect overall deformability of circulating RBC by rejuvenation of the RBC population and if this might be related to improved endurance capacity. Thirty male field soccer players were assigned in either a WB-EMS group (EG, n = 10), a training group (TG, n = 10), or a control group (CG, n = 10). EG performed 3 × 10 squat jumps superimposed with WB-EMS twice per week in concurrent to 2-4 soccer training sessions and one match per week. TG only performed 3 × 10 squat jumps without EMS in addition to their soccer routine and the CG only performed the usual soccer training and match per week. Subjects were tested before (Baseline) and in week 7 (wk-7), with blood sampling before (Pre), 15-30 min after (Post), and 24 h after (24 h post) the training. Endurance capacity was determined before and directly after the training period. The key findings of the investigation indicate an increase in young RBC in the EG group along with improved overall RBC deformability, represented by decreased SS1/2:EImax Ratio. Analysis of the different RBC subfractions revealed improved RBC deformability of old RBC during study period. This improvement was not only observed in the EG but also in TG and CG. Changes in RBC deformability were not associated to altered RBC-NOS/NO signaling pathway. Endurance capacity remained unchanged during study period. In summary, the effect of WB-EMS on RBC physiology seems to be rather low and results are only in part comparable to previous findings. According to the lower training volume of the present study it can be speculated that the soccer specific training load in addition to the WB-EMS was too low to induce changes in RBC physiology.","2019","2020-05-20 00:27:08","2020-05-20 00:27:08","","","","MAY","10","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2019.00548; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628303754","adult; human; human experiment; male; article; soccer player; controlled study; blood sampling; normal human; endurance; jumping; human cell; erythrocyte count; electrostimulation; cell density; cell separation; erythrocyte deformability; erythrocyte lifespan; nitric oxide; nitric oxide synthase; whole body electrostimulation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Sixteen players (17.1 ± 0.8 years, 173.9 ± 4.5 cm height, 65.4 ± 5.4 kg body mass and 54.6 ± 2.8 ml/kg/min VO2max) participated in SSGs 4vs4 with and without insider floater, under an invasion format and another one of goals scored. HR, RPE and technical demand of the SSGs were registered. The results found no significant differences (p < 0.05) in the HR response caused by the presence of the floater. In the invasion format, a large effect size (ES) was obtained in the FC permanence time at values below 80% HRmax in the floater task (4vs4+C) with respect to 4vs4. In SSGs of cross line, the TE demonstrated large values in 4vs4-L vs 4vs4+C (ES = 1.4). The technical demand was influenced by the presence of the floater, with a greater number of control, conduction and pass actions, as well as collective success of the cross line task.

Se registraron la FC, el RPE y la demanda técnica de cada formato realizado. Los resultados no mostraron diferencias significativas (p < 0.05) en la respuesta de la FC en función de la presencia del comodín. En el formato cuyo objetivo era cruzar la línea de fondo rival en conducción, se obtuvo un tamaño del efecto (TE) grande en el tiempo de permanencia de la FC en valores inferiores al 80% FCmax en la tarea con comodín (4vs4+C) respecto al 4vs4. En los JRs donde había que cruzar la línea del campo rival el TE mostró valores de RPE más grandes (TE = 1.4) en 4vs4 que en 4vs4+C. La demanda técnica estuvo influida por la presencia del comodín, existiendo mayor número de acciones de control, conducción y pase, así como de finalizaciones exitosas en tareas con objetivo cruzar la línea de fondo del campo rival.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of PBMT (using infrared low-level laser therapy) applied before a progressive running test on functional aspects, muscle damage, and inflammatory and oxidative stress markers in high-level soccer players. A randomized, triple-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial was performed. Twenty-two high-level male soccer players from the same team were recruited and treated with active PBMT and placebo. The order of interventions was randomized. Immediately after the application of active PBMT or placebo, the volunteers performed a standardized high-intensity progressive running test (ergospirometry test) until exhaustion. We analyzed rates of oxygen uptake (VO2 max), time until exhaustion, and aerobic and anaerobic threshold during the intense progressive running test. Creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activities, levels of interleukin-1β (IL-1-β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), levels of thiobarbituric acid (TBARS) and carbonylated proteins, and catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities were measured before and five minutes after the end of the test. PBMT increased the VO2 max (both relative and absolute values - p<0.0467 and p<0.0013, respectively), time until exhaustion (p<0.0043), time (p<0.0007) and volume (p<0.0355) in which anaerobic threshold happened, and volume in which aerobic threshold happened (p<0.0068). Moreover, PBMT decreased CK (p<0.0001) and LDH (p<0.0001) activities. Regarding the cytokines, PBMT decreased only IL-6 (p<0.0001). Finally, PBMT decreased TBARS (p<0.0001) and carbonylated protein levels (p<0.01) and increased SOD (p<0.0001)and CAT (p<0.0001) activities. The findings of this study demonstrate that preexercise PBMT acts on different functional aspects and biochemical markers. Moreover, preexercise PBMT seems to play an important antioxidant effect, decreasing exercise-induced oxidative stress and consequently enhancing athletic performance and improving postexercise recovery.

The aim of this research was to develop a new flexibility test to examine the forward split in athletes. Material and methods: In this study, 15 gymnasts, 10 Taekwondo athletes, 5 football players, and 10 karate athletes (20 males and 20 females) volunteered for this experiment and were evaluated in a common movement pattern, the forward split. In the experimental condition, participants performed the forward split on a mattress using infrared sensor technology (IST test), and, afterward, they performed the forward split on a mattress without infrared sensor technology (N-IST test). Two trials of this procedure were conducted. Results: For concurrent validity, no significant difference in the average distances of the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) from the mattress in Trials I and II was found between the IST and N-IST tests - p = 0.664 and p = 0.710, respectively. Conclusions: The findings of this study confirm the concurrent and construct validity of the IST test, which was created to measure the height of the ASIS from the mattress in a forward-split test. Thus, this test can be used by coaches, athletes, and sports scientists to improve and monitor the forward-split tests of athletes in training programs.","2019","2020-05-20 00:27:20","2020-05-20 00:27:20","","5-9","","3","33","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.5114/areh.2019.87743; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2003528392","female; football player; human; male; article; adolescent; athlete; gymnast; measurement; clinical assessment tool; concurrent validity; Infrared Sensor Technology Test; joint mobility","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This research followed a prospective surveillance design utilizing a large cohort of children, ages, 5–11, who play recreational football, soccer, and baseball/softball in Florida. The study venue was a large athletic facility in Hillsborough County, Florida. The sports observed were soccer (girls’ and boys’), baseball, softball, and football. Internal and external advisory boards were consulted throughout the study. Methods Certified Athletic Trainers (ATCs) were hired to use High School Reporting Information Online (RIO) for injuries and the Ipad-administered pediatric concussion tool developed by ImPACT Applications, Inc for baseline/follow-up concussion data. Results Over the course of the project, 26 RIO-reported injuries were reported. Football and soccer produced the greatest rate of injuries. There were 12 concussions which comprised nearly half of all the RIO injuries (46%). We conducted 882 baseline concussion tests and 13 follow-up tests over the 2 years. Conclusions To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time data have been collected and reported on sports injuries in the study population. Future studies built on these findings will allow for the development of targeted guidelines and interventions for coaches, players, and parents so sports injury-related morbidity and mortality decrease in our youngest athletes.","2019","2020-05-20 00:27:21","2020-05-20 00:27:21","","","","5","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0216217; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002002707","female; human; male; article; football; soccer; sport injury; major clinical study; prospective study; return to sport; sport; competition; athlete; concussion; sex difference; child; head injury; school child; age; fracture; knee injury; United States; face injury; leg injury; shoulder injury; baseball; contusion; softball; exposure; ankle injury; elbow injury; sprain; ligament sprain; recreational game","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To date, players’ perceptions and epidemiological studies of injuries on artificial turf have been undertaken in soccer and rugby but no published work exists in Australian football or cricket. Perceived increased injury risk has been identified as a barrier to the adoption of artificial turf surfaces. The aim of this research was to ascertain Australian football and cricket players’ perceptions of the nature and severity of injuries on artificial turf compared to natural grass. Methods: A self-report, validated questionnaire was completed by 32 senior male football players, 17 senior female football players and 25 senior male cricket players at one artificial turf venue. Players were asked to rate the perceived likelihood and the perceived severity of the following injuries on artificial turf compared to natural grass; bruises/cork, concussion, cuts/grazes/abrasions, dislocations/fractures, strains, and sprains. Responses were recorded on a four-point Likert scales of more likely/severe, the same, less likely/severe or undecided. Statements on injury risk were also rated on a five-point scale from strongly agree to strongly disagree. Results: The female football players reported the strongest response to the statement on whether there was an increased risk of sustaining an injury on artificial turf compared to natural grass, mean value of 2.3/5.0 compared to 2.9 and 3.0 for male football and cricket players, respectively. Compared to natural grass, cuts/grazes and abrasions were the only injuries that all players reported as more likely (82 % female football, 72 % male football and 65 % cricket) and more severe (65 % female football, 56 % male football, 44 % cricket) on the artificial turf surface. Female football players also believed that muscle strains were more likely to occur on the artificial turf surface, with 41 % reporting them more likely and 35 % reporting the same likelihood as natural grass. Discussion: It is evident from the results that there is a perceived increased risk of skin-related injuries on artificial turf for Australian football and cricket players. It has been suggested that skin injuries are underreported as they may not be identified by injury definitions based on severity. The inclusion of skin-related injuries in injury surveillance studies would be beneficial to inform injury prevention strategies or evidence-based education about injuries on artificial turf surfaces.","2019","2020-05-20 00:27:24","2020-05-20 00:27:24","","S110-S111","","","22","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsams.2019.08.152; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002901960","adult; conference abstract; female; football player; human; male; controlled study; concussion; questionnaire; perception; fracture; accident prevention; self report; nonhuman; education; Likert scale; contusion; dislocation; grass; muscle strain; abrasion; skin injury","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: A retrospective analysis of 2018 injuries data of 246 Brazilian elite male youth soccer athletes were performed. The athletes were divided in two groups: under 11 to under 15 (group A, n=149) and under 17 to under 20 (group B, n=107). Descriptive and Chi-Square statistical analysis were used to characterize the sample and compare groups A and B. Results: A total of one hundred and eleven injuries were recorded over the season. Athletes of group A had ten trauma injuries, eighteen non-contact acute injuries and thirteen overuse injuries. In group B, twenty-five athletes had trauma injuries, twenty-five had non-contact acute injuries and twenty had overuse injuries, with significant differences between groups for all types of injuries (p=0.01, p=0.17 and p=0.19 respectively). Eighty-eight training injuries and twenty-one during game injuries were identified, but only during game injuries showed differences between groups (p=0.01). Hip, knee and overuse injuries were more frequent in artificial grass field compared to natural grass field (p=0.01) in both groups. Athletes of group A had an injury-time loss of ten days, while group B had twenty-four days of absence. Conclusion: Elite youth soccer athletes under 17 to under 20 had suffered more total and during game injuries, and more injury-days loss than under 11 to under 15 players. Moreover, hip, knee and overuse injuries were more frequent on artificial grass field in both groups. Clinical implications: this research shows injury incidence in elite youth soccer players and can contribute to future researches in analysis and development of injuries risk patterns and preventive programs for these athletes.

Individual exposure to match play and training, injury incidence and characteristics (player position, injury mechanism, type of injuries, severity of injuries, recurrent vs. new injuries, season variation of injury pattern) in a female futsal team were prospectively recorded for three consecutive seasons (2015-2018). Incidences were calculated per 1,000 h of exposure. A total of 30 injuries were reported during the three seasons within a total exposure of 4,446.1 h. The overall, match and training incidence of injuries were 6.7, 6.4 and 6.8 injuries/1,000 h of exposure, respectively. Most injuries had a non-contact mechanism (93%), with the lower extremity being the most frequently injured anatomical region (5.62 injuries/1,000 h of exposure). The most common type of injury was muscle/tendon (4.9 injuries/1,000 h of exposure) followed by joint (nonbone) and ligament (1.3 injuries/1,000 h of exposure). The injuries with the highest injury burden were those that occurred at the knee (31.9 days loss/1,000 h exposure), followed by quadriceps (15.3 day loss/1,000 h) and hamstring (14.4 day loss/1,000 h) strains. The first few weeks of competition after pre-season and soon after the Christmas break were the time points when most injuries occurred. These data indicate that sub-elite female futsal players are exposed to a substantial risk of sustaining an injury. To reduce overall injury burden, efforts should be directed toward the design, implementation and assessment of preventative measures that target the most common diagnoses, namely, muscle/tendon and ligament injuries.","2019","2020-05-20 00:27:28","2020-05-20 00:27:28","","","","11","2019","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.7989; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629925909","adult; female; human; article; hamstring muscle; injury; incidence; major clinical study; prospective study; young adult; follow up; fracture; muscle injury; leg injury; quadriceps femoris muscle; contusion; anterior cruciate ligament; injury severity; ankle sprain; ankle injury; ligament injury; seasonal variation; bone stress; tendon injury; achilles tendon; lower leg","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The primary aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of musculoskeletal injuries over one 12-month period in junior male South African football players, attending a local football academy. The functional movement ability of the players was evaluated using FMS™ testing. The possible correlation between football injuries in this group and pre-season FMS™ scores was investigated. One hundred and nineteen (119) players participated. This study adopted a quantitative descriptive research approach. A questionnaire was used to record injuries that occurred in the previous 12 months. The Functional Movement ScreenTM (FMS™) was used to assess the functional movement patterns of the players. The relationship between previous injury and FMS™ score was analysed and the confidence level was set at p<0.05. There was a high prevalence (88.2%) of injuries within this group. Lower-limb injuries were the most common (78.3%) and most injuries occurred at the knee joint (42%). The mean FMS™ score was 12.9±1.56, which was lower than that of similar groups tested.

In 2004 (n = 1029), 2008 (n = 705) and 2015 (n = 1008), a representative sample of Swiss amateur soccer coaches was interviewed by telephone about the frequency of injuries in their teams, the implementation of preventive measures and the use of injury prevention programmes. In the 2015 survey, 86.1% of amateur coaches stated that injury prevention is important and 85.3% of amateur coaches reported that they would implement some kind of preventive measures. The proportion of teams which performed a prevention programme according to minimal standards remained unchanged between 2008 (21.7%) and 2015 (21.9%), although a second prevention programme was made available in 2011. Only 8.6% of the 30+/40+ league teams, which are composed as a function of age, implemented a programme. Overall, the level of implementation of prevention programmes in this real-world context is still unsatisfactory. Offering an additional programme did not lead to a higher willingness to implement such programmes among the coaches. Concerted efforts are needed to remove barriers that hinder the use of such programmes, particularly among coaches of 30+/40+ league teams.","2019","2020-05-20 00:27:32","2020-05-20 00:27:32","","","","9","16","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph16091593; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2001881689","adult; female; human; male; article; soccer; soccer player; sport injury; incidence; major clinical study; adolescent; retrospective study; accident prevention; Switzerland; age distribution; preventive medicine; risk reduction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The overall injury incidence was 2.93 injuries per 1000 hours, with higher incidence during matches than during training (10.16 vs 2.10 injuries/1000 h; rate ratio [RR] = 0.21; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.17-0.25; P < .05), with the U14 age group presenting the lowest injury rate (2.39 injuries/1000 h; RR = 1.15-1.57; P < .05). In terms of injury severity, moderate injuries were the most frequent (1.42 injuries/1000 h). Muscle injuries were the most common type of injuries (57.7%; 2.75 injuries/1000 h; RR = 1.84-13.4; P < .05), and hamstrings (93/268) were the most affected muscle group (0.58 injuries/1000 h; RR = 1.58-2.91; P < .05). Injury incidence showed a seasonal variation as indicated by peaks in August and October. In matches, specifically, the match period between 75 and 90 minutes showed the highest injury incidence (10.29 injuries/1000 h; RR = 1.89-6.38; P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study suggest that specific preventive strategies must be implemented to try to reduce the injury incidence in Spanish elite young soccer players attending to the characteristics of each age group.","2019","2020-05-20 00:27:35","2020-05-20 00:27:35","","1-7","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1123/jsr.2019-0113; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629636981","adult; human; male; article; soccer player; hamstring muscle; controlled study; major clinical study; prospective study; team sport; cohort analysis; muscle injury; prevention; injury severity; seasonal variation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) has approved newer generation artificial turf for soccer competition at the elite level, but many elite-level athletes prefer to play on natural grass surfaces due to a perceived increase in injury rate, discomfort, and fatigability on artificial turf. Hypothesis: Injury rates and rates of individually categorized types of injury experienced on artificial turf are noninferior to rates of injury on the standard comparator, natural grass, in elite-level Major League Soccer athletes. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: Over the course of 4 Major League Soccer seasons (2013-2016), athlete injury data were recorded electronically. Injury data recorded in matches between 2 Major League Soccer teams were then analyzed. Playing surface was known for each venue, and all artificial turf surfaces were rated as 2-star according to FIFA criteria. Incidence rate ratios (Artificial Turf ÷ Natural Grass) were calculated with a 95% CI (α =.05) for both overall injury incidence and individual injury subgroups. A noninferiority margin (δ) of 0.15 was used to determine noninferiority of injury incidence rates. Results: A total of 2174 in-game injuries were recorded during the study period, with 1.54 injuries per game on artificial turf and 1.49 injuries per game on natural grass (incidence rate ratio, 1.033; 95% CI, 0.937-1.139). Within injury subgroups, overall ankle injury, Achilles injury, and ankle fracture were found to have a statistically higher incidence on artificial turf. Artificial turf was found to be noninferior to natural grass for overall foot injury and forefoot injury. No statistically significant differences were found in knee injuries between the 2 surfaces. Conclusion: The overall rate of injury on artificial turf was noninferior to that on natural grass. Within individual injury categories, a higher rate of ankle injury was found on artificial turf. No other injury subgroup demonstrated statistically significant differences between surfaces. Clinical Relevance: FIFA 2-star rated artificial turf is a viable alternative to natural grass in elite-level soccer competition. Innovative research methods for comparing artificial turf versus natural grass may elucidate relative advantages with respect to player safety.

However, we show that the German football pyramid is no more immune to the problem of insolvency than other European football league pyramids. We provide evidence to show that insolvency occurs in German football at a frequency comparable to the English and French leagues. We also show that the pattern of insolvency is consistent with the experience of English and French football identified in Szymanski (2017) and Scelles et al. (2018). Using season-level data from 1994-1995 to 2016-2017 for the first four German divisions (N = 2,626), we show that random shocks, attributable to deviations of actual team performance from expected performance, are the crucial driver of insolvency risk. These shocks frequently result in relegation to a lower tier of competition, which generates lower match attendance and revenues.

Methods: In this study, an intra-team communication tool (ITCT) was used for players to report the amount of communication (ACOM) received, and the amount of perceived benefit to performance of that communication (BCOM). The ITCT was used to understand how a professional football team is connected, by ITC and passing, and the relationship between ITC and passing, using social network analysis (SNA). Results: The results indicated that the team was highly connected and cohesive for ITC, but less so for passing. In matches won compared to lost, passing connections were lower and ITC connections were higher. There were negative correlations between ITC and passing for the mean sociometric status values. For the SNA metrics, network edges were higher in matches won compared to drawn for BCOM. Cohesion was lower in drawn compared to won matches for BCOM, and lower compared to matches won and lost for passing. SMS was higher in matches won compared to lost for ACOM and BCOM, but was higher in matches lost compared to won for passing. Conclusions: The results could indicate that in matches when possession was increased, and ITC decreased, the team may coordinate implicitly, by relying on pre-existing knowledge of practiced playing structures. Whereas, in matches with low possession, increased levels of ITC may be required, due to the uncertainty associated with defending. However, further research is needed to confirm the current explanations of the results. This study has implications for the design of training practice.

Our hypothesis is that OP would present a higher energy expenditure and intensity level values during matches than DP, due to specific actions according to the on-court role. METHODS: Fifty-two players, including 24 DP and 28 OP (mean age of 34±9 years), from eight French teams involved in the national elite championship and in the French national cup, participated. The seven wheelchair rugby players' classes were differentiated from 0.5 points (most severe deficiencies) to 3.5 points (less severe deficiencies). DP and OP were regrouped from 0.5 to 1.5 points and from 2 to 3.5 points, respectively. Energy expenditure (in kcal), intensity level (in metabolic equivalent of task) and physical activity time (in minutes) of wheelchair rugby players during competition were evaluated. RESULTS: Statistical analysis between DP and OP showed a significant difference in vigorous activity time with a higher vigorous activity time for OP than DP; P<0.007), associated with higher mean intensity level for OP vs. DP (4.3±1.0 METs vs. 3.8±0.9 METs respectively; P=0.049). No significant differences between DP and OP were found for active energy expenditure (385±158 kcal vs. 446±199 kcal, for DP and OP respectively) during matches. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlighted significantly different wheelchair rugby player profiles between competing DP and OP for the time spent in high intensity and intensity level. Offensive players were more explosive during a match than DP; therefore, training should be adapted accordingly to their roles.","2019","2020-05-20 00:27:47","2020-05-20 00:27:47","","387-393","","3","59","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L626546950; http://dx.doi.org/10.23736/S0022-4707.18.08214-2","adult; female; human; male; football; exercise; statistics and numerical data; accelerometry; young adult; physiology; procedures; athletic performance; classification; comparative study; wheelchair; time factor; energy metabolism; disabled person","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We assumed that the aim at the content in small-sided games would significantly affect the HR values of participating soccer players. The research group was comprised of players (n = 6) of the soccer club FK DAC 1904 Dunajská Streda (U15) at the age of 14 ± 0.7 years. The HR values were evaluated on the basis of collected data, which we obtained using sport testers and special software POLAR TEAM2. In order to find out the statistical significance of the difference in HR was used the One-Way ANOVA and the Bonferroni post hoc test. The level of statistical significance was set at 5 %. We found out that by the change of the small-sided game's content focus, the internal reaction of players' organism to training load was at different level. In the SSG3, with the emphasis on the improvement of individual's final offensive game activity – shooting, was recorded the highest achieved HRavg value of the monitored players (181.83 ±7.11 beats.min−1). This form of the SSG was the most intense. However, there were no significant differences in HR values among the individual forms of the SSG. Our recommendation is to employ in the systematic training process small forms of small-sided games with various content focus, because by the means of it we can adequately prepare the players for the match load itself.

Inter- and intra-rater reliability of the athletic ability assessment in subelite Australian rules football players. J Strength Cond Res 33(1): 125-138, 2019-The aim of this study was to determine the inter- and intra-rater rater reliability of the Athletic Ability Assessment (AAA) in subelite Australian Rules football (ARF) players. Eighteen male ARF players completed the AAA movement assessment (overhead squat, double lunge [left and right], single-leg Romanian deadlift [left and right], chin-up and push-up), on 2 occasions separated by 1 week. During the first movement assessment, players were filmed in the frontal and sagittal planes. Ten raters took part in the study (1 experienced rater and 9 novices) and were assigned in a quasirandom manner, to complete either (a) real-time assessment on 2 occasions, (b) real-time assessment on 1 occasion, or (c) video-based assessment on 2 occasions. When assessed in real-time, of the 7 component movements of the AAA, raters registered moderate or greater intrarater agreement on between 2 and 5 occasions. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) of between 0.50 and 0.61 for the AAA total score indicated poor real-time intrarater reliability for this variable. When assessed by video-recording, raters registered moderate or greater intrarater agreement on between 6 and 7 occasions. The ICC for total score ranged between 0.60 and 0.93. Overall poor interrater reliability was evident for AAA component movements regardless of whether it was assessed in real-time or from video. Findings suggest the AAA is most reliably used when assessed through video. It is recommended that if comparison between multiple raters is desired, a stringent training process be applied so that the interpretation of AAA scoring criteria is standardized across raters.","2019","2020-05-20 00:27:49","2020-05-20 00:27:49","","125-138","","1","33","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1519/JSC.0000000000002175; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L625597510","adult; human; male; football; young adult; exercise test; athletic performance; videorecording; Australia; reproducibility; movement (physiology); observer variation; standards","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

But, exercise fidelity in IPEPs is seldom evaluated. We developed a checklist to assess exercise fidelity in the Knee Control IPEP, and the primary aim was to evaluate its inter-rater reliability. The secondary aim was to study Knee Control exercise fidelity in youth football players and compare sex differences. Methods: This observational study included 11 teams with male and female youth players (11–18 years). On average, the players trained with the Knee Control IPEP for 7 weeks (SD 1.4, range 6–10 weeks). After the training period, two physiotherapists attended a team training session to observe players executing exercises and individually assessed their performance of these exercises as correct or incorrect based on standardised criteria set in the fidelity checklist. Agreement between observers was assessed using Cohen’s kappa coefficient. Results: The observers agreed on 144 out of 160 (90%) observations (Kappa = 0.80, substantial agreement). Both observers agreed on correct exercise performance for 69 out of 144 observations (exercise fidelity 48%). Exercise fidelity was higher in females (56%) than males (40%), but the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.18). Conclusion: The Knee Control exercise fidelity checklist had high inter-rater reliability with substantial agreement. The exercise fidelity was low, which could hamper the preventive effects of an IPEP. Understanding the reasons for low exercise fidelity is important and more effort should focus on increasing exercise fidelity alongside the implementation of IPEPs.","2019","2020-05-20 00:27:51","2020-05-20 00:27:51","","","","1","5","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002422690; http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40798-019-0209-9","adult; female; football player; human; human experiment; male; article; football; sport injury; knee; exercise; observational study; training; adolescent; child; prevalence; normal human; physiotherapy; physiotherapist; leg injury; musculoskeletal system parameters; interrater reliability; knee control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ten team sport players (age 22 ± 1 years) were enrolled in this crossover study and performed 1271 trials (436 Apex vs. Apex, 464 Viper vs. Viper, 371 Apex vs. Viper) consisting of 5-10 m, 10-15 m, 15-20 m, and 20-30 m sprints. Inter-unit reliability was calculated using the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) with 95% confidence interval (CI) and coefficient of variation (CV), while between-unit and model analysis were subsequently performed to evaluate differences in Vpeak. Apex (10 Hz) units had excellent inter-unit reliability for all distances, whereas Viper (10 Hz) units had good to excellent reliability. The CV was good (< 5%) for both GNSS models. Significant differences were found in Vpeak in Sprint 5-10 = 0.13 CI (0.08, 0.182) m. s-1, Sprint 10-15 = 0.06 CI (0.01, 0.1) m. s-1, and in Sprint overall = 0.06 CI (0.03, 0.09) m. s-1. Both Viper and Apex units can consistently report Vpeak measurements since good to excellent ICC and good CV were found. However, Vpeak measurements are significantly different between models for distances less than 15 m. In conclusion, this study shows that differences exist among manufacturers' models and that the two GNSS models should not be used interchangeably to quantify Vpeak.

Here, we tested the interaction between racial identity and RHI on neurobehavioral outcomes, brain volumetric measures, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) total tau (t-tau), phosphorylated tau (p-tau181), and Aβ1–42 in symptomatic former National Football League (NFL) players. Methods: 68 symptomatic male former NFL players (ages 40–69; n = 27 Black, n = 41 White) underwent neuropsychological testing, structural MRI, and lumbar puncture. FreeSurfer derived estimated intracranial volume (eICV), gray matter volume (GMV), white matter volume (WMV), subcortical GMV, hippocampal volume, and white matter (WM) hypointensities. Multivariate generalized linear models examined the main effects of racial identity and its interaction with a cumulative head impact index (CHII) on all outcomes. Age, years of education, Wide Range Achievement Test, Fourth Edition (WRAT-4) scores, CVD risk factors, and APOEε4 were included as covariates; eICV was included for MRI models. P-values were false discovery rate adjusted. Results: Compared to White former NFL players, Black participants were 4 years younger (p = 0.04), had lower WRAT-4 scores (mean difference = 8.03, p = 0.002), and a higher BMI (mean difference = 3.09, p = 0.01) and systolic blood pressure (mean difference = 8.15, p = 0.03). With regards to group differences on the basis of racial identity, compared to White former NFL players, Black participants had lower GMV (mean adjusted difference = 45649.00, p = 0.001), lower right hippocampal volume (mean adjusted difference = 271.96, p = 0.02), and higher p-tau181/t-tau ratio (mean adjusted difference = −0.25, p = 0.01). There was not a statistically significant association between the CHII with GMV, right hippocampal volume, or p-tau181/t-tau ratio. However, there was a statistically significant Race x CHII interaction for GMV (b = 2206.29, p = 0.001), right hippocampal volume (b = 12.07, p = 0.04), and p-tau181/t-tau ratio concentrations (b = −0.01, p = 0.004). Conclusion: Continued research on racial neurological disparities could provide insight into risk factors for long-term neurological disorders associated with American football play.","2019","2020-05-20 00:27:53","2020-05-20 00:27:53","","","","","13","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00440; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L630481395","adult; football player; human; male; article; football; Caucasian; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; controlled study; major clinical study; scoring system; body mass; cognition; age; cardiovascular risk; white matter; risk factor; Black person; race difference; systolic blood pressure; nervous system parameters; aged; education; concentration (parameter); brain region; gray matter; tau protein; protein phosphorylation; clinical outcome; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; repetitive head impact; hippocampus; imaging software; amyloid beta protein[1-42]; cerebrospinal fluid; lumbar puncture; neuropsychological test; APOEe4 gene; apolipoprotein E4; brain size; cumulative head impact index; subcortex; Verio; volumetry; Wide Range Achievement Test","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this single-group interventional study, 78 talented male youth soccer players (mean age, 9.54 years) were critically selected by the Korean Educational Development Institute and underwent a 22-week training program consisting of 16 weeks of PF and basic skill training (90 min/week) and 6 weeks of intensive training (3, 150-min sessions/week). We assessed the pre-and post-training body composition, cardiovascular endurance, muscle strength and endurance, and flexibility. We also measured power, agility, coordination and speed, passing ability, VRT, and ART. All variables improved after training. Post-training VRT correlated with ART, muscle mass, power, cardiovascular endurance, 10-m dribble time, 10-m ball touch count, and 10-m successful pass count. ART only correlated with muscle mass. ART and 10-m ball-touch count influenced VRT, and VRT influenced ART. In conclusion, the training program enhanced the PF and visual-and auditory-related reactions in talented youth soccer players. This study suggests the importance of the assessed relationships, indicating that a training program that improves these parameters enhances the players’ performance.","2019","2020-05-20 00:27:55","2020-05-20 00:27:55","","","","24","16","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph16244909; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2003271981","human; male; article; soccer player; controlled study; training; adolescent; juvenile; child; school child; muscle strength; agility; endurance; fitness; muscle mass; skill; vision; touch; hearing; body composition; intervention study; auditory reaction time; visual reaction time","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper studies the effect of the constraints on the performance, motor behavior and visual search behavior of soccer goalkeepers during the corner kick. 31 participants, divided into three groups depending on the level of play, tried to catch the ball out of a corner kick in two situations (static and dynamic), while their eye movements were recorded. Among the results it is observed that the experts have a more stable performance, while the other groups perform worse in the most difficult situation; that the experts make a later start of their run up towards the ball and a faster motor pattern to catch it; and that the information of the players involved is not relevant, goalkeepers dedicate values close to 0% of their visual total time to them.

AIM: To assess current practices related to video review of concussion in professional sports internationally, and compare protocols and diagnostic criteria used to identify and manage potential concussions. METHODS: Current concussion management guidelines from professional national and international sporting codes were reviewed. Specific criteria and definitions of video signs associated with concussion were compared between codes. Rules and regulations adopted across the codes for processes around video review were also assessed. RESULTS: Six sports with specific diagnostic criteria and definitions for signs of concussion identified on video review participated in this study (Australian football, American football, world rugby, cricket, rugby league and ice hockey). Video signs common to all sports include lying motionless/loss of responsiveness and motor incoordination. The video signs considered by the majority of sports as most predictive of a diagnosis of concussion include motor incoordination, impact seizure, tonic posturing and lying motionless. Regulatory requirements, sideline availability of video, medical expertise of video reviewers and use of spotters differ across sports and geographical boundaries. By and large, these differences reflect a pragmatic approach from each sport, with limited underlying research and development of the video review process in some instances. CONCLUSIONS: The use of video analysis in assisting medical staff with the diagnosis or identification of potential concussion is well established across different sports internationally. The diagnostic criteria used and the expertise of the video review personnel are not clearly established, and research efforts would benefit from a collaborative harmonisation across sporting codes.","2019","2020-05-20 00:28:00","2020-05-20 00:28:00","","1299-1304","","20","53","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bjsports-2018-099727; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629514823","sports medicine; human; sport injury; brain concussion; procedures; videorecording","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: Eleven male youth players (16 ± 1 years, 178 ± 7 cm, 67 ± 7 kg) participated in a 2 × 40-min simulated soccer match, completing 30 rounds (160 s each) with every round including multidirectional and linear sprinting (LS20m), jumping (CMJ) and running at different intensities. During each round, LS20m, CMJ, agility, heart rate (HR), oxygen uptake (VO2), energy expenditure (EE), substrate utilization and perceived exertion RPE were assessed. In addition, the blood level of lactate (Lac) was obtained after each of the five rounds. Creatine kinase (CK) concentration, maximal voluntary isometric knee extension and flexion, CMJ, number of skippings in 30 s, and subjective ratings on the Acute Recovery and Stress Scale (ARSS) were examined before and immediately, 24 and 48 h after the simulation. Results: During the game %HRpeak (p < 0.05, d = 1.08), %VO2peak (p < 0.05; d = 0.68), Lac (p < 0.05, d = 2.59), RPEtotal (p < 0.05, d = 4.59), and RPElegs (p < 0.05, d = 4.45) all increased with time during both halves (all p < 0.05). Agility improved (p < 0.05, d = 0.70) over the time-course of the game, with no changes in LS20m (p ≥ 0.05, d = 0.34) or CMJ (p ≥ 0.05, d = 0.27). EE was similar during both halves (528 ± 58 vs. 514 ± 61 kcal; p = 0.60; d = 0.23), with 62% (second half: 65%) carbohydrate, 9% (9%) protein and 26% (27%) fat utilization. With respect to recovery, maximal voluntary knee extension (p ≥ 0.05, d = 0.50) and flexion force (p ≥ 0.05, d = 0.19), CMJ (p ≥ 0.05, d = 0.13), number of ground contacts (p ≥ 0.05, d = 0.57) and average contact time (p ≥ 0.05, d = 0.39) during 30-s of skipping remained unaltered 24 and 48 h after the game. Most ARSS dimensions of load (p < 0.05, d = 3.79) and recovery (p < 0.05, d = 3.22) returned to baseline levels after 24 h of recovery. Relative to baseline values, CK was elevated immediately and 24 h after (p < 0.05, d = 2.03) and normalized 48 h later. Conclusion: In youth soccer players the simulated match evoked considerable circulatory, metabolic and perceptual load, with an EE of 1042 ± 118 kcal. Among the indicators of perceived and performance fatigability examined, the level of CK and certain subjective ratings differed considerably immediately following or 24–48 h after a 2 × 40-min simulated soccer match in comparison to baseline. Accordingly, monitoring these variables may assist coaches in assessing a U17 player’s perceived and performance fatigability in connection with scheduling training following a soccer match.","2019","2020-05-20 00:28:01","2020-05-20 00:28:01","","","","","10","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2019.01383; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629991961","human; human experiment; male; article; elite athlete; soccer player; heart rate; oxygen consumption; controlled study; adolescent; rating scale; convalescence; agility; fatigue; normal human; knee function; creatine kinase; carbohydrate; energy expenditure; fat; protein; lactic acid; lactate blood level; contact time; process model; Acute Recovery and Stress Scale; clinical indicator; performance fatigability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Materials and methods Twenty elite female soccer players (aged 25.2±3.1 years) wore wrist actigraph units and heart rate (HR) monitors during night-sleep throughout 9 consecutive days (6 day-time training sessions [DT], 2 day-time matches [DM], and 1 evening-time match [EM]) of an international tournament. Training and match loads were monitored using the session-rating of perceived exertion (s-RPE) and wearable 18-Hz GPS (total distance covered [TD], training and match exposure time, and high-speed running [HSR]) to characterize training and match loads. Results Individually, s-RPE, TD, exposure time, and HSR during training sessions ranged from 20 to 680 arbitrary units (AU), 892 to 5176 m, 20 to 76 min, and 80 to 1140 m, respectively. During matches, s-RPE, TD, exposure time, and HSR ranged from 149 to 876 AU, 2236 to 11210 m, 20 to 98 min, and 629 to 3213 m, respectively. Individually, players slept less than recommended (<7 hours) on several days of the tournament, especially after EM (n = 8; TST ranging between 6:00–6:54 h). Total sleep time coefficient of variation (CV) ranged between 3.1 and 18.7%. However, all players presented good sleep quality (i.e., sleep efficiency 75%; individual range between: 75–98%) on each day of the tournament. Most of the players presented small fluctuations in nocturnal cardiac autonomic activity (individual nocturnal heart rate variability [HRV] ranged from 3.91–5.37 ms and HRV CV ranged from 2.8–9.0%), while two players presented higher HRV CV (11.5 and 11.7%; respectively). Conclusion Overall, this study highlights the substantial individual variability in sleep and HRV measures, suggesting the adoption of an individual approach to monitor sleep, training and match loads and recovery, to better understand how players cope with highly demanding competitions.","2019","2020-05-20 00:28:02","2020-05-20 00:28:02","","","","9","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0218635; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002920554","adult; female; human; article; soccer player; clinical article; exercise; controlled study; competition; running; velocity; sleep time; remission; heart rate variability; adoption; sleep quality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate the intra-rater and inter-rater reliability of the one-legged hyperextension test (1LHET), the empty can (EC) and full can (FC) tests, the standing stork test (SST), the bridge-hold test (BHT) and the 747 balance test (747BT). Method: Thirty-five healthy, injury-free male athletes (cricket and soccer players), aged 16–24 years, were evaluated by two physiotherapists. For each of the tests, the participants were evaluated twice (on two consecutive days) by each physiotherapist. Both the intra- and inter-rater reliability were determined. Cohen's kappa (k) was calculated for the 1LHET, the EC and FC tests and the SST. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used for the BHT and the 747BT. A confidence level of 95% (p ≤ 0.05) was applied as the criterion for determining the statistical significance of the results. Results: The SST presented with the lowest level of intra-rater agreement (ICC = –0.20 to 0.10). On the other hand, the EC test was the only test where one rater achieved an excellent intersessional agreement (k = 0.80; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.40–1.20). Substantial to excellent results for the inter-rater agreement for both sessions were recorded for the 1LHET (k = 0.70–0.90) and the BHT (ICC = 0.70–0.90). Conclusion: Reliability values need to be considered when making clinical decisions based on screening tests. A more refined description of the testing procedures and criteria for interpretation might be necessary before including the six screening tests investigated in this study in formal screening protocols. Clinical implication: Confirmed reliability of screening tests would enable sports professionals to make informed decisions when designing preparticipatory musculoskeletal screening tools and when dealing with the management of injury risks in athletes.

A season long review was conducted analysing all of the top four (n = 1152) and bottom four teams' (n = 1124) lineouts. Findings showed the number of tries scored originating from a lineout play for the top four teams' (1.57 tries per match) was higher in comparison to the bottom four teams' (1.10 tries per match) (p < .05). Lineout success did not change between the top (87%) and bottom (85%) four teams (p > .05). However, the top four teams were more effective in stealing opposition possession at a lineout (17%) compared to the bottom four teams (9%, p < .05). Additionally, top four teams showed a more forwards orientated style of play using binding actions (top = 62%, bottom = 56%, p < .05) and maul formation (top = 55%, bottom = 47%, p < .05). These results suggest coaches should focus on analysis of opposition tactics in lineout play in an aim to develop effective strategies to steal opposition possession at a lineout.

However, research has demonstrated that such formal coach education has limited impact on the practice of the coach when they return to working with their players. To date coach education research has failed to analyze the way in which learning styles have been presented on such awards and qualifications and the impact such knowledge may have on the coaches' practice. As such, research to investigate the promotion of learning styles within a coach education environment took place to establish if coach education promotes the use of specific teaching strategies for particular learners via the use of learning styles. The research process included semi-structured interviews with eight Football Association Level One Award Coaches, who identified that they were clearly and explicitly introduced to the concept of VARK learning styles during their coach education experiences. These findings demonstrate entry-level soccer coaches in the UK are encouraged to place the learning style of a player at the center of learning despite the suggestion from research that learning styles have a negligible impact on learning. The research also demonstrated that coach educators and the curriculum of coach education courses failed to utilize current research to reflect the latest teaching and learning strategies.

It is also an effective carrier of moral cultivation. Extracurricular activities with volleyball as the leading project can not only develop students' personality, but also cultivate their strong will and self-restraint ability, teamwork consciousness, collectivism spirit, ability to withstand failure and frustration, and cultivate good psychological and moral qualities such as perseverance, confidence and courage. The objectives of this study include: (1) the current situation of Amateur Volleyball activities in Beijing Sports University; (2) students' hobbies in Amateur Volleyball and their own characteristics (mainly height); (3) investment in the construction of school grounds and facilities; (4) analysis and Research on the environmental atmosphere of school volleyball activities. Methods: Starting from the development of Amateur Volleyball in Beijing Sports University, this study uses the methods of documentation, questionnaire, mathematical statistics and logical analysis, in order to achieve the expected investigation and analysis results. Results: In order to train volleyball reserve talents, improve the level of Volleyball in our country, and better communicate, communicate, develop and integrate the volleyball culture of sports colleges and universities with ordinary schools. The development of Amateur Volleyball activities is also related to students' hobbies and their own characteristics (mainly height). As long as the school can create a good atmosphere for students in all aspects, it can cultivate students' interest in volleyball activities, give full play to students' subjective initiative, make them actively participate in volleyball activities, strengthen students' ideological education, cultivate their team spirit, and coordinate their physical and psychological development. Conclusions: The development of Amateur Volleyball activities in Beijing Sports University is not optimistic. The students' interest and love of volleyball are far less than basketball and football. The poor condition of hardware facilities such as venues and equipment is one of the important factors affecting the development of Amateur Volleyball activities in Beijing Sports University. Some rules on the volleyball court and the school's volleyball environment have affected the development of Amateur Volleyball activities in Beijing Sports University to a certain extent. Insufficient attention from school leaders and insufficient publicity from schools cannot arouse students' interest in volleyball learning.","2019","2020-05-20 00:28:09","2020-05-20 00:28:09","","143-144","","","125","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bcpt.13266; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628907199","conference abstract; human; human experiment; football; basketball; questionnaire; height; learning; attention; volleyball; statistics; China; leadership; education; student; court; investment; computer; atmosphere; documentation; mass medium; physical development","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: Thirty-four sub-elite adult male Gaelic football players completed tailored Gaelic football SSGs on three different pitch sizes (40 x 20 m, 60 x 20 m, 80 x 20 m) in a 4v4 format, resulting in 312 individual player observations over the course of the 2018 season. Results: Participants performed significantly greater high-speed running (>17 km∙h−1) (p ≤ 0.001) and sprinting (>22 km∙h−1) (p ≤ 0.001) on the 60x20 m pitch compared to the 40x20 m and 80x20 m pitches. Pitch size had only trivial effects on the average heart rate and the peak heart rate recorded in games. Games played on the 40x20 m pitch resulted in more scores per team (p = 0.062; η2 = 0.071), no-score entries (p = 0.075; η2 = 0.067) and possessions per team (p = 0.015; η2 = 0.106), while ball-in-play percentage was moderately higher (p = 0.040; η2 = 0.082) on the 80x20 m pitch. Conclusion: Coaches should consider pitch size and the associated effects on physical and technical demands when planning training games, with specific reference to the stated objectives of each respective session.

One-way and repetitive exercises in these activities and the postural structure of young people in the development process are significantly affected. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between posture, body composition, balance and spinal stability in 13 years old football players. Methods: Nineteen male players (age=139±3.41 months; body-mass index (BMI)=18.01±2.74 kg/m2, sports age=5.23±1.84 years) from the U13 unior team of Karsiyaka Sports Club were included in the study. The posture of the participants was measured with the New York Posture Scale (NYPS); balance was measured with the Balance Error Scoring System (BEST); spinal stability was measured with lateral bridge test, and the body composition was measured with the skinfold (Holtain, UK) and body fat ratio (BFR) and BMI calculated from the measurements obtained from subscapular, biceps, triceps and suprailiac regions. Results: No significant correlation was found between posture and body composition (BMI; p=0.099, BFC; p=0.811), balance (p=0.311) and spinal stability (p=0.242). However, there was a significant negative correlation between spinal stability and BMI (r=-0,719, p=0.001) and BFR (r=-0,518, p=0.23).

While FMS provides information about core stability, movement patterns and dynamic balance, YBT is used only for evaluating dynamic balance. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationships between the results obtained from FMS and YBT evaluations in female soccer players. Material and Methods: Twenty-four female soccer players aged between 17-30 years were evaluated by an experienced physiotherapist in terms of FMS and YBT. Each movement was scored between 0 (not able to perform) and 3 (performed correctly) in FMS, which includes seven different movement tests. The YBT scores was obtained by using the standardized formula of the values obtained after measurements which were performed in three different directions with the help of an equipment. Results: The mean age was 21.1±4.0 years, mean FMS result was 16.6±1.6, mean right-side YBT results was 96.4±4.9%, mean left-side YBT was 96.3±4.1%. Using Spearman's correlation analysis, significant and moderate correlations were found between FMS results and right YBT results (rho:0.495; p:0.014), and FMS results and left YBT results (rho:0.512; p:0.011). Conclusions: According to our results, FMS and YBT scores, which are used as determinants of injury risk, are moderately related to each other in female soccer players. Thus, we believe, using FMS which includes more comprehensive evaluations might provide more detailed results about injury prediction for professionals who work in sports field.

The aim of this study was to evaluate salivary cortisol as a marker of recovery in elite Rugby Union players. METHOD: Over a 10-week pre-season training period, 19 male elite Rugby Union players provided saliva swabs bi-weekly (Monday and Friday morning). Subjective markers of recovery were collected every morning of each training day. Session Rating of Perceived Exertion (sRPE) was taken after every training session and training load was calculated (sRPE x session duration). RESULTS: Multi-level analysis found no significant association between salivary cortisol and training load or subjective markers of recovery (all, p>0.05), over the training period. Compared to baseline (week 1), Monday salivary cortisol significantly increased in weeks 4 (14.94 ± 7.73 ng.ml; p=0.04), 8 (16.39 ± 9.53 ng.ml; p=0.01) and 9 (15.41 ± 9.82 ng.ml; p=0.02) and Friday salivary cortisol significantly increased in weeks 5 (14.81 ± 8.74 ng.ml; p=0.04) and 10 (15.36 ± 11. 30 ng.ml; p=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: The significant increase in salivary cortisol on certain Mondays may indicate players did not physically recover from the previous week of training or match at the weekend. The increased Friday cortisol levels and subjective marker of perceived fatigue indicated increased physiological stress from the weeks training. Regular monitoring of salivary cortisol combined with appropriate planning of training load, may allow sufficient recovery, to optimise training performance.","2019","2020-05-20 00:28:15","2020-05-20 00:28:15","","1-24","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1123/ijspp.2018-0945; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L627625300","adult; human; male; article; rugby; injury; exercise; controlled study; season; monitoring; multilevel analysis; fatigue; physiological stress; hydrocortisone; saliva; hormone","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite the growing support for GBAs in the academic literature, evidence is currently lacking regarding the application of GBAs across different sports and developmental levels. Accordingly, the present study aimed to investigate Gaelic football coaches' self-reported practice activities and session sequencing and assess how these aligned with benchmarks outlined in the GBA academic literature. In addition, coaches' practice activities were examined as a function of developmental level (academy/developmental/senior) and time of the season (pre/peak). Responses to an online survey, completed by 150 practicing inter-county Gaelic football coaches, were analysed. During pre-season, coaches estimated spending the majority of time in Training Form activities (e.g., isolated fitness, technical skill), whereas they predominately utilised Playing Form activities (e.g., modified games) during peak-season. Coaches reported utilising Training Form activities in the first half of their coaching session before progressing to game like activities in the second half of the session. Few differences were noted across developmental levels. Further education with Gaelic football coaches is required to ensure a more sophisticated conceptual understanding and application of GBAs in coaches' practice.

There is, however, little documentation of the variation that can exist between data recorders. The aim of this study was, therefore, to explore the effect on reported injuries when team recorders or supervisors are involved in research. Injury data collected prospectively over five seasons for the U16, U17, and U18 age groups in a youth football (soccer) academy were used to compare different recording settings based on the research involvement of the clinicians. A research-invested team physiotherapist reported an 8.8 times greater incidence (P < 0.001) of non-time-loss injuries and a 2.5 times greater incidence (P < 0.001) of minimal injuries (1-3 days lost) compared to a setting where neither the team physiotherapists nor the supervisor relied on the collected data for research purposes. When team physiotherapists were not invested in research themselves but were supervised by a researcher, the incidence of non-time-loss injuries and minimal injuries was 2.5 times (P < 0.001) and 2.0 times greater (P < 0.01) than in the non-invested setting, respectively. However, there were no differences between recording settings for overall incidence of time-loss injuries. The results from this study demonstrate that involving clinicians that are relying on the collected data for research purposes can significantly affect the reported rates of non-time-loss and minimal injuries. Time-loss injuries overall were not affected by research investment, and should therefore be preferred for comparisons between teams and seasons.","2019","2020-05-20 00:28:17","2020-05-20 00:28:17","","1031-1039","","7","29","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L627180871; http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/sms.13427","human; soccer; sport injury; injury; incidence; adolescent; physiotherapist; youth sport; information processing; personnel","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A total of 110 soccer players (75 males / 35 females; 12.73 ± 0.65 / 12.76 ± 0.59 years) participated in this cross-sectional study. They were divided into two groups according to their pubertal status. Bone and lean masses were measured with Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry. An independent t-test and an adjusted by subtotal lean and training experience multivariate analysis of covariance were used to analyse the differences in bone mass values between genders and maturity status. Female soccer players presented higher bone mass values than their male counterparts in most of the measured weight-bearing sites. Moreover, when stratifying by pubertal status, peripubertal and postpubertal females had higher subtotal body and lumbar spine bone mass than males. Comparing between pubertal status groups before adjustment, both male and female postpubertal players showed higher bone mass than their pubertal counterparts. After adjusting, these differences disappeared and, in fact results were inverted as bone mass at the femoral neck was higher in both male and female peripubertal soccer players than in postpubertal players. Bone mass seems to be more intensely stimulated by playing soccer in female than male players, particularly in the lumbar spine. The results of peripubertal players showing higher bone mass at the femoral neck after adjusting suggest that playing soccer during the peripubertal stage could be an effective activity to achieve optimal bone mass values.

Hamstring flexibility as a risk factor for hamstring injury has not yet been examined prospectively in Gaelic games. Objective: To examine whether hamstring flexibility, using the modified active knee extension (AKE) test, and previous injury are risk factors for hamstring injury in Gaelic players and to generate population-specific AKE cutoff points. Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: School and colleges. Patients (or Other Participants): Adolescent and collegiate Gaelic footballers and hurlers (n = 570). Intervention(s): The modified AKE test was completed at preseason, and hamstring injuries were assessed over the course of one season. Any previous hamstring injuries were noted in those who presented with a hamstring injury. Main Outcome Measures: Bilateral AKE scores and belween-leg asymmetries were recorded. Receiver operating characteristic curves were implemented to generate cutoff points specific to Gaelic players. Univariate and backward stepwise logistic regression analyses were completed to predict hamstring injuries, hamstring injuries on the dominant leg, and hamstring injuries on the nondominant leg. Results: Mean flexibility of 64.2° (12.3°) and 64.1° (12.4°) was noted on the dominant and nondominant leg, respectively. Receiver operating characteristic curves generated a cutoff point of < 65° in the AKE on the nondominant leg only. When controlled forage, AKE on the nondominant leg was the only predictor variable left in the multivariate model (odds ratio = 1.03) and significantly predicted hamstring injury (%2 = 9.20, P= .01). However, the sensitivity was 0% and predicted the same amount of cases as the null model. It was not possible to generate a significant model for hamstring injuries on the dominant leg (P > .05), and no variables generated a P value < .20 in the univariate analysis on the nondominant leg. Conclusions: Poor flexibility noted in the AKE test during preseason screening and previous injury were unable to predict those at risk of sustaining a hamstring strain in Gaelic games with adequate sensitivity.

Sixteen players participated in the study. Two simulated matches were performed, and the physical demand was quantified by the total distance covered, distance covered per minute and distance at different intensities. In addition, technical performance variables were analyzed during matches. The total distance covered was, on average, 3259.97 ± 180.27 m, with 113.26 ± 6.11 m / min. Approximately 26% of the total distance was covered at high intensity (i.e.,> 15 km.h-1), with significant decrease of these actions in the second half of matches (p <0.05). There were no significant correlations between physical and technical performance variables. However, there were positive correlations classified as ""strong"" of technical variable ""unsuccessful kicks"" with the total distance covered during match. This study demonstrated that simulated futsal matches of the U-19 category present high physical demand, with values of distance covered per minute at different intensities similar to those found in professional Brazilian players during official matches. There were no significant correlations between physical and technical performance during matches; however, correlations classified as ""strong"" between unsuccessful kicks were obtained with total distance covered (r=0.51; p=0.06), distance covered at high intensity (r=0.51; p=0.09) and with distance covered in sprints (r=0.56; p=0.06), suggesting that the efficacy of kicks is influenced by the match intensity. O objetivo do presente estudo foi quantificar a demanda física, em termos de distância percorrida, e verificar a relação com o desempenho técnico durante partidas simuladas de futsal em atletas da categoria sub-19. Participaram do estudo 16 jogadores de nível estadual. Foram realizadas duas partidas simuladas, sendo a demanda física quantificada pela distância total percorrida, distância percorrida por minuto e distância em diferentes intensidades. Ainda, analisou-se variáveis de desempenho técnico durante as partidas. A distância total percorrida foi, em média, de 3259,97 ± 180,27 m, com média 113,26 ± 6,11 m/min. Aproximadamente 26% da distância total foi percorrida em ações de alta intensidade (i.e., >15 km/h), com decréscimo significativo destas ações no segundo tempo dos jogos (p<0,05). Não foram observadas correlações significativas entre as variáveis de demanda física e as variáveis de desempenho técnico. Contudo, verificou-se correlações positivas classificadas como ""fortes"" da variável técnica finalização errada por atleta no jogo com a distância total percorrida no jogo (r=0,54; p=0,06), distância percorrida em alta intensidade (r=0,51; p=0,09) e com a distância percorrida em sprints (r=0,56; p=0,06). Este estudo demonstrou que partidas simuladas de futsal, realizadas com atletas da categoria sub-19, apresentam uma elevada demanda física, com valores de distância percorrida por minuto e percorrida em diferentes faixas de intensidade semelhantes aos encontrados em atletas brasileiros profissionais durante jogos oficiais. Não se observou correlações significativas entre o desempenho físico e o desempenho técnico durante as partidas; contudo, foram obtidas correlações classificadas como ""fortes"" da variável finalização errada com a distância total e com a distância percorrida em alta intensidade, sugerindo que a eficácia das finalizações é influenciada pela intensidade do jogo.","2019","2020-05-20 00:28:28","2020-05-20 00:28:28","","1-11","","","21","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","","","","https://gateway.library.qut.edu.au/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=c8h&AN=141528638&site=ehost-live&scope=site","Soccer; Athletes, Professional; Human; Brazil; Athletic Performance; Sprinting; Team Sports; Exercise Intensity; Athletic Training Programs; Sporting Events; Kicking; Physical Performance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Physical tests were conducted immediately pre- and post-four distinct workouts, in the following order: (1) TMG in the rectus femoris (RF) and biceps femoris (BF) muscles; (2) squat and countermovement jumps (SJ and CMJ); and (3) 30-m sprint velocity. To analyze the differences in the assessed variables before and after each training session, the differences based on magnitudes were calculated. RESULTS: After strength and plyometric workouts, the players presented possible to almost certain impairments in sprint and jump performance and in the Vc RF (effect sizes varying from 0.26 to 0.64). After the sprint training session, possible to very likely decreases were observed in the SJ, 30-m sprint, and Vc BF (effect sizes varying between 0.21 and 0.44). In contrast, after the technical training, athletes demonstrated a possible increase in the SJ and Vc in both muscles examined (effect sizes varying from 0.13 to 0.20). CONCLUSIONS: The main finding of this research is that, for the vast majority of results, the direction of changes observed in the Vc were the same as those observed in performance assessments. This suggests that the Vc might be used as a sensitive marker of acute variations in speed and power performance of elite team-sport athletes.","2019","2020-05-20 00:28:29","2020-05-20 00:28:29","","1-25","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1123/ijspp.2018-0959; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L627287451","adult; human; male; article; rugby; exercise; team sport; training; young adult; height; rectus femoris muscle; muscle strength; fatigue; effect size; jumping; biceps femoris muscle; muscle contractility","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Moreover, it is extremely rare in the very young without risk factors. This paper presents a patient with ischemic colitis associated with heat stroke and rhabdomyolysis after intense exercise under high-temperature conditions. A 20-year-old man presented with mental deterioration after a vigorous soccer game for more than 30 minutes in sweltering weather. He also presented with hematochezia with abdominal pain. The laboratory tests revealed the following: AST 515 U/L, ALT 269 U/L, creatine kinase 23,181 U/L, BUN 29.1 mg/dL, creatinine 1.55 mg/dL, and red blood cell >50/high-power field in urine analysis.

Method: One hundred and nineteen professional athletes were included. Thirty practiced basketball (10 in A League, 10 in B League and 10 in First National League), twenty-one practiced handball (First League), thirteen practiced volleyball (A League), thirty practiced cycling (Continental Pro Tour) and twenty-five practiced soccer (First League). The age was 26 ± 4 years old [18–38] for 186 ± 13 cm height [167–213], 84 ± 14 kg weight [63–120], and 23.8 ± 1.9 kg/cm2 Body Mass Index [19.2–28.6]. The knee strength was measured using a CybexNorm® isokinetic dynamometer at the beginning of sport season. Quadriceps and hamstring maximal strength was reported to the body weight for comparison. The isokinetic conventional ratios (hamstring-to-quadriceps) and the bilateral (quadriceps-to-quadriceps and hamstring-to-hamstring) ratios were calculated for the 60 and 180°/s angular speed. Results: Age, height and weight were different depending on the sports practiced. The 180°/s angular speed allowed a better identification of muscle profiles according to the sports practiced. The quadriceps relative strength of soccer players was greater than basketball, handball players and cyclist's ones. The hamstrings relative strength of soccer players was superior to the other sports except the handball players. The conventional and bilateral ratios were not different in accordance with the sport practice. Conclusion: Our study has quantified and compared the anthropometric characteristics and isokinetic values of high level athletes. Soccer players have an isokinetic profile different from other sports players, probably related to the specificity of this sport practice. These results can be used by coaches, physiotherapists and reference sports physicians in relation to the individual and collective sports that have been studied.","2019","2020-05-20 00:28:34","2020-05-20 00:28:34","","401-409","","6","34","","","","","","","","","","English French","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scispo.2019.05.006; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002157178","adult; human; article; football; soccer; soccer player; hamstring muscle; basketball; priority journal; sport; athlete; body mass; body weight; muscle strength; body height; volleyball; knee function; professional athlete; cyclist; handball; dynamometer; cycling; basketball player; quadriceps femoris muscle; handball player","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Participants were male futsal players (n = 14) with a mean age of 12.58 ± 0.66 years. The force evaluation was performed pre- and post-intervention using the Biodex System Pro 4™ isokinetic dynamometer, at speeds of 60°/s, 180°/s, and 300°/s. The FIFA 11+ protocol was applied before the start of each regular training, twice a week, for 18 weeks, with an approximate duration of 25 minutes. In the pre-intervention analysis, a higher than 10% difference between dominant and non-dominant limbs was found in flexors' and extensors' peak torque, at the 60°/s and 180°/s speeds, respectively. In the postintervention analysis, no such asymmetries were found. Post-intervention, there was an increase in the agonistantagonist ratio on the dominant side, at the 60°/s speed, approaching the ideal value proposed in the literature (60%). There was also an increase in athletes' isokinetic performance. The 18-week application of the FIFA 11+ protocol promoted an improvement in the isokinetic performance of the knee's extensor and flexor muscles, and decreased the muscular asymmetries between the limbs of young futsal athletes. El objetivo de este estudio fue evaluar el desempeño isocinético de la musculatura flexora y extensora de la rodilla de jugadores de fútbol sub-13 después de la práctica de 18 semanas del protocolo FIFA 11+. Participaron 14 jugadores de fútbol del sexo masculino con edad media de 12,58±0,66 años. La evaluación de la fuerza se realizó a través del dinamómetro isocinético (Biodex System Pro 4 ™), a velocidades de 60°/s, 180°/s y 300°/s, pre y post-intervención. El protocolo FIFA 11+ fue aplicado antes del inicio de cada entrenamiento regular, dos veces por semana, durante 18 semanas, con una duración aproximada de 25 minutos. En el análisis previo a la intervención se encontró una diferencia entre el miembro dominante y el no dominante superior al 10% en el pico de torque de flexores y extensores a 60°/s y 180°/s, respectivamente. En el análisis postintervención no se encontraron tales asimetrías. Se observó un aumento de la relación agonista / antagonista en el lado dominante en la velocidad de 60°/s, post-intervención, aproximándose al valor ideal propuesto por la literatura (del 60%). Se observó un aumento del rendimiento isocinético de los atletas después de la intervención. En este sentido, se concluye que la aplicación de 18 semanas del protocolo FIFA 11+ promovió una mejora del desempeño isocinético de las musculaturas extensoras y flexoras de rodilla, además de disminuir las asimetrías musculares entre los miembros en jóvenes atletas de fútbol.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate differences in knee muscle strength and muscle imbalances in soccer players according to lower back pain. METHODS: One hundred and thirty-six male professional soccer players (20.49 ± 3.73 years, 76.57 ± 8.24 kg, 182.63 ± 6.73 cm) volunteered for the study. The isokinetic dynamometer PrimaDOC (EASYTECH, Italy) was used to assess the hamstring and quadriceps strength at the selected speeds of 60∘/s, whereas the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RDQ) was used as a health status measure to assess physical disability caused by low back pain. RESULTS: A univariate analysis of variance has shown that there is a statistically significant difference among the groups divided into Absolut peak torque right knee flexors, Absolut peak torque left knee flexors, Ratio between hamstrings and quadriceps strength right leg, Ratio between hamstrings and quadriceps strength left leg based on the RDQ scores. On the other hand, no other significant differences among the groups were found in other parametersCONCLUSION: The current study indicates that knee muscle strength variables, resulting from an isokinetic testing, have the potential to discriminate between soccer players with and without a history of low back pain. However, low back pain is a multidimensional phenomenon and knee muscle strength or imbalance alone cannot be expected to explain low back pain.","2019","2020-05-20 00:28:37","2020-05-20 00:28:37","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.3233/BMR-171109; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629333913","adult; human; male; article; soccer player; hamstring muscle; knee; controlled study; muscle training; physical disability; muscle strength; Italy; cumulative trauma disorder; dynamometer; torque; quadriceps femoris muscle; health status; univariate analysis; low back pain; Roland Morris disability questionnaire","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Isolated & combined wearable technology underestimate the total energy expenditure of professional young rugby league players; a doubly labelled water validation study. J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2019-Accurately determining total energy expenditure (TEE) enables the precise manipulation of energy balance within professional collision-based sports. Therefore, this study investigated the ability of isolated or combined wearable technology to determine the TEE of professional young rugby league players across a typical preseason and in-season period. Total energy expenditure was measured via doubly labelled water, the criterion method, across a fourteen-day preseason (n = 6) and 7-day in-season (n = 7) period. Practical measures of TEE included SenseWear Pro3 Armbands in isolation and combined with metabolic power derived from microtechnology units. SenseWear Pro3 Armbands significantly under-reported preseason (5.00 [2.52] MJ·d; p = 0.002) and in-season (2.86 [1.15] MJ·d; p < 0.001) TEE, demonstrating a large and extremely large standardized mean bias, and a very large and large typical error, respectively. Combining metabolic power with SenseWear Pro3 Armbands almost certainly improved preseason (0.95 [0.15] MJ·d; Effect size = 0.32 ± 0.04; p < 0.001) and in-season (1.01 [0.15] MJ·d; ES = 0.88 ± 1.05; p < 0.001) assessment. However, SenseWear Pro3 Armbands combined with metabolic power continued to significantly under-report preseason (4.04 [2.38] MJ·d; p = 0.004) and in-season (2.18 [0.96] MJ·d; p = 0.002) expenditure, demonstrating a large and very large standardized mean bias, and a very large and large typical error, respectively. These findings demonstrate the limitations of utilizing isolated or combined wearable technology to accurately determine the TEE of professional collision-based sport athletes across different stages of the season.","2019","2020-05-20 00:28:39","2020-05-20 00:28:39","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1519/JSC.0000000000003434; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L630491862","human; article; rugby; clinical article; controlled study; season; athlete; effect size; energy expenditure; water; microtechnology; validation study","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

He denied history of chest pain, SOB, lightheadedness or syncope. Negative family cardiac history. Screening EKG showed right axis deviation, left fascicular block and inverted inferior and anterior T-waves. TTE showed EF 65% with no regional wall motion abnormalities but frequent PVCs. Holter monitor showed frequent multifocal PVCs (.4000 in 24 h). He also underwent a stress echo which revealed that the PVCs did not resolve with exercise. Because of this workup, further history was elicited from the patient and he admitted to 3 episodes of palpitations during football activities within the last 3 years. During each of these, he would feel lightheaded and ask to be removed from game play. All were self-limited and blamed on dehydration. Physical Exam: VS: BP 100/78, HR 63, SpO2 98%; Gen: No acute distress, AAandO x3; HEENT: normal; Neck: supple, trachea midline, no JVD, no lymphadenopathy; Respiratory: CTA bilaterally, normal work of breathing; Cardiac: RRR, no G/R, no murmur in seated, squatting or standing position, peripheral pulses 21 upper and lower extremity, no edema; GI: soft, NT, ND, no hepatosplenomegally; MSK: normal ROM, strength and sensation of upper and lower extremities; Psych: appropriate judgement, normal mood. Differential Diagnosis: Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy Sarcoidosis Athletic Heart Brugada Syndrome Test Results: TTE: EF 65%, no regional wall abnormalities; Cardiac MRI: LV normal, Moderately dilated RV, RVEF 42%, abnormal contractility of lateral RV free wall with mid-wall dyskinesis, fibrosis of mid-distal segments of lateral and posterior RV free wall; Implantable Loop Recorder: Recurrent runs of non-sustained polymorphic VT, longest 10 seconds with a syncopal episode; Myocardial PET: no increased uptake in the lateral RV free wall, negative for sarcoidosis; Genetic Testing: (1) PKP2 and TTR mutations. Final Diagnosis: Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardio-myopathy (ARVC). Discussion: ARVC accounts for 22% of sudden cardiac death (SCD)in Italy. It isless commonly diagnosedin the US. In 30% to 50% of cases, there is autosomal dominant genetic transmission which results in fibro-fatty replacement of normal myocyte architecture causing conduction changes. ARVC is frequently clinically silent with the first symptom being SCD. Diagnosis requires 2 major criteria, one major/2 minor criteria or 4 minor criteria defined by the 2010 Revised Task Force on ARVC. Major and minor criteria are defined in 6 categories: Dysfunction/Structural Changes, Tissue Biopsy, Repolarization changes, Depolarization changes, Arrhythmia and Family History. This patient met 3 major criteria for ARVC. Outcome: Started Sotalol 80 mg BID for rate control, increased to 120 mg BID for continued ectopy. Subcutaneous ICD implanted but during post-op visit, device was double-counting heart rate with risk for inappropriate shock. It was immediately disabled and he was placed in life-vest. Second opinion from the Johns Hopkins University ARVC clinic confirmed diagnosis of ARVC. Transvenous ICD placed. Follow-up: He is currently recovering from ICD placement. He will undergo stress testing to determine a safe range for exercise, after which, he will be allowed to do modified cardio and strength training. Unfortunately, he will never be able to participate in collegiate football.","2019","2020-05-20 00:28:48","2020-05-20 00:28:48","","e28","","2","29","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/JSM.0000000000000728; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629860323","conference abstract; human; male; football; lower limb; case report; clinical article; heart rate; adolescent; athlete; follow up; motion; decision making; resistance training; Italy; mood; sudden cardiac death; physical examination; arrhythmogenesis; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; genetic screening; heart right ventricle dysplasia; human cell; dizziness; autosomal dominant inheritance; sensation; diagnosis; differential diagnosis; family history; dehydration; standing; heart palpitation; thorax pain; muscle cell; hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; edema; neck; T wave; muscle contractility; heart murmur; presyncope; sarcoidosis; genetic susceptibility; disabled person; lymphadenopathy; distress syndrome; Brugada syndrome; depolarization; dyskinesia; fibrosis; Holter monitor; implantable cardiac monitor; repolarization; sotalol; stress echocardiography; trachea; work of breathing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These tests are also used in different selection processes and talent identification, but the significance of the tests for the selection of youth players to national teams are relatively unknown. The aim of this study was to compare jump ability between youth football players selected or not selected for the national team. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 22 players (aged 17±2 years), 11 national players (NP) and 11 non-national players (NNP) were evaluated in three different jump tests; CMJ, AJ and SLJ. Mean scores for the tests were analyzed and compared. RESULTS: Significant differences were found between the groups regarding jump height in favor of the NP group in both the CMJ (NP 39.9±5.0 cm vs. NNP 34.2±4.9 cm, P=0.013) and the AJ (NP 47.1±5.4 vs. NNP 40.9±4.7, P=0.010). No group difference was found regarding jump length in SLJ (NP 246.2±17.9 vs. NNP 232.9±16.5, P=0.084).

While FMS provides information about core stability, movement patterns and dynamic balance, YBT is used only for evaluating dynamic balance. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationships between the results obtained from FMS and YBT evaluations in female soccer players. Material and Methods: Twenty-four female soccer players aged between 17-30 years were evaluated by an experienced physiotherapist in terms of FMS and YBT. Each movement was scored between 0 (not able to perform) and 3 (performed correctly) in FMS, which includes seven different movement tests. The YBT scores was obtained by using the standardized formula of the values obtained after measurements which were performed in three different directions with the help of an equipment. Results: The mean age was 21.1±4.0 years, mean FMS result was 16.6±1.6, mean right-side YBT results was 96.4±4.9%, mean left-side YBT was 96.3±4.1%. Using Spearman's correlation analysis, significant and moderate correlations were found between FMS results and right YBT results (rho:0.495; p:0.014), and FMS results and left YBT results (rho:0.512; p:0.011). Conclusions: According to our results, FMS and YBT scores, which are used as determinants of injury risk, are moderately related to each other in female soccer players. Thus, we believe, using FMS which includes more comprehensive evaluations might provide more detailed results about injury prediction for professionals who work in sports field.

Yet there remains a need for more research investigating the relationship between individuals' online identities and offline outcomes. This study focuses on the context of college football recruiting, specifically on the relationship between recruits' Twitter activities and coaches' scholarship offer decisions. Based on impression management theory, we analyze content posted by recruits and apply machine learning to identify instances of self-promotion and ingratiation in 5.5 million tweets. Using negative binomial regression, we discover that an athlete's level of engagement on Twitter is a positive and significant predictor of the number of offers. Also, both self-promotion and ingratiation are positively related to attracting new offers. Our results highlight the growing importance of social media as a recruiting tool and suggest that recruits' online self-presentation may have significant offline impacts. This research can benefit athletes and coaches by informing communication strategies during recruitment, and may also yield insight into the consequences of online impression management in other types of recruitment beyond sports.","2019","2020-05-20 00:28:57","2020-05-20 00:28:57","","3-20","","1","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/big.2018.0094; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L626888190","human; football; soccer; machine learning; university; social media; organization and management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, due to the frequent changes in direction and speed it considerably stresses the players' upper limbs. 13 athletes have undergone two sports-related tests on an inertial drum bench and several kinematic parameters have been registered. Most athletes use a semi-circular pattern which is considered protective for the upper limb. With increasing speed, range of motion (ROM) increases. Release angles increment and contact angles reduce, displacing the push angle forward to increase speed. Instead, the more anterior late push angle used to increase velocity is a factor which further loads the shoulder joint. However, other factors affecting propulsion technique, such as posture and wheelchair set up should be studied to further reduce loading on the upper limb.","2019","2020-05-20 00:29:00","2020-05-20 00:29:00","","129-133","","1","30","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L631663066","adult; human; article; elite athlete; velocity; wheelchair rugby; range of motion; shoulder; kinematics; stress; body position; cervical spinal cord injury; contact angle; psychological well-being","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Eighteen male university division 1 soccer players were the subjects of this study. Each participant was asked to cut with dribbling in four situations (2 speeds × 2 directions). The motion system and force platform were used synchronously to collect movements and ground reaction force during cutting with dribbling. The two-way repeated-measures analysis of variance was used for statistical analysis (α = .05). The knee external rotation angle of the non-pivot leg was greater when cutting to the non-dominant side at the event of the non-pivot leg toe-off and pivot leg landing. The hip extension/flexion angle of the non-pivot leg was different between directions and speeds at both events. The height difference between the anterior-superior iliac spines was greater at the pivot leg landing when cutting to the non-dominant side. This study might provide the evidence to support the visual search strategies for observing the regions of hip and knee to predict cutting direction. Therefore, defenders could focus on the motion of the pelvis, hip, and knee to anticipate the cutting motion in the match.

This study aimed to analyze the kinematic aspects of these tackling motions in 1-on-1 tackles in an experimental setting using a 3-dimensional motion-capture system. Methods: A total of 65 one-on-one tackles were recorded using a marker-based, automatic, digitizing motion-capture system. A documented tackle was classified into 1 of 3 types, which was decided based on the first point of contact on the ball carrier and the head position at the time of impact: shoulder tackle (reference tackle), arm tackle, and head-in-front tackle. The orientations of the head, trunk, and shoulder at impact were calculated and statistically compared with each other. Results: The distribution of tackles recorded in this study was as follows: 38 shoulder, 23 arm, and 4 head-in-front tackles. In comparison with the shoulder tackle as a reference, shoulder abduction on the side of impact was higher in both the arm and head-in-front tackles, while shoulder external rotation was lower in the head-in-front tackles. In the latter type of tackle, significant decreases in neck extension and ipsilateral neck rotation were also indicated. Conclusion: The kinematics in both the arm tackle and the head-in-front tackle is significantly different from that in the shoulder tackle and may represent a distinct risk factor for shoulder dislocation.","2019","2020-05-20 00:29:02","2020-05-20 00:29:02","","149-157","","1","28","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jse.2018.06.023; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2001107371","adult; human; human experiment; article; rugby; arm; priority journal; thigh; young adult; normal human; abduction; range of motion; rotation; trunk; shoulder; kinematics; head; foot; pelvis; motion analysis system; shoulder dislocation; joint mobility; lower leg","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: A total of 574 professional football players from the Canadian Football League (CFL) completed baseline evaluations with computerized neurocognitive testing (CNT) prior to the 2016 competitive season. Player age, education, history of concussion, LD, and ADHD were analyzed for K-D and Immediate Post Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing (ImPACT) performance. A series of analyses of co-variance (ANCOVA's) were used to compare participants with a history of LD and ADHD with history of concussion as a co-variate. Results: Approximately 5% of participants reported a diagnosed history of LD and 13% with ADHD. Performance on the K-D test was not significantly correlated with age, education, or history of concussion but was significantly correlated with history of LD and ADHD. Participants with LD performed approximately 6.9 s slower on the K-D test (t[563] = 4.70, p. = 0.0003) and participants with ADHD were approximately 2 s slower (t[572] = 2.04, p. = 0.04).

We characterised the accuracy of the KD test and the World Rugby Head Injury Assessment (HIA-1) screening tools as methods of off-field evaluation for concussion after a suspicious head impact event. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was performed in elite English rugby union competitions between September 2016 and May 2017. The study population comprised consecutive players identified with a head impact event with the potential to result in concussion. The KD test was administered off-field, alongside the World Rugby HIA-1 screening tool, and the results were compared with the preseason baseline. Accuracy was measured against a reference standard of confirmed concussion, based on the clinical judgement of the team doctor after serial assessments. RESULTS: 145 head injury events requiring off-field medical room screening assessments were included in the primary analysis. The KD test demonstrated a sensitivity of 60% (95% CI 49.0 to 70) and a specificity of 39% (95% CI 26 to 54) in identifying players subsequently diagnosed with concussion. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for prolonged KD test times was 0.51 (95% CI 0.41 to 0.61). The World Rugby HIA-1 off-field screening tool sensitivity did not differ significantly from the KD test (sensitivity 75%, 95% CI 66 to 83, P=0.08), but specificity was significantly higher (91%, 95% CI 82 to 97, P<0.001). Although combining the KD test and the World Rugby HIA-1 multimodal screening assessment achieved a significantly higher sensitivity of 93% (95% CI 86% to 97%), there was a significantly lower specificity of 33% (95% CI 21% to 48%), compared with the HIA-1 test alone. CONCLUSIONS: The KD test demonstrated limited accuracy as a stand-alone remove-from-play sideline screening test for concussion. As expected with the addition of any parallel test, combination of the KD test with the HIA-1 off-field screening tool provided improved sensitivity in identifying concussion, but at the expense of markedly lower specificity. These results suggest that it is unlikely that the KD test will be incorporated into multimodal off-field screening assessments for concussion at the present time.","2019","2020-05-20 00:29:06","2020-05-20 00:29:06","","1526-1532","","24","53","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bjsports-2017-098560; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L630009162","adult; human; male; football; injury; brain concussion; prospective study; physiology; competitive behavior; sensitivity and specificity; neuropsychological test; eye movement; standard","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of this case report is to present an unexpected cause of knee pain in an otherwise healthy athlete. Our patient is a 14-year-old male football player who presented to sports medicine clinic with the chief complaint of left knee pain and swelling. Onset of pain was 2 months prior and he began to complain of intermittent knee swelling over the last several weeks prior to this clinic visit. There was no reported history of trauma or injury. Pain worsened with activity and was localized to his anterior knee. NSAIDs and knee brace did not alleviate symptoms. He denied any associated knee instability, popping or locking. Neurological signs and symptoms were absent. Review of systems was otherwise negative. Examination revealed a moderate sized left knee effusion with tenderness to palpation around the patella and medial joint line. There was no ecchymosis or erythema. Strength exam was normal. Range of motion was decreased in flexion and extension due to swelling. He had a negative Lachman and McMurray test as well as negative anterior and posterior drawer tests. No ligament laxity was appreciated with stress testing. Examination of the contralateral knee was normal. He was otherwise well appearing with normal gait. X-rays were normal. MRI of the knee revealed distal femoral osteomyelitis with associated intraosseous and subperiosteal abscess with deep posterior knee soft tissue abscess. Labs significant for CRP 9.45 mg/dL, ESR 57 mm/hr. He was taken to the OR for I and D and cultures returned positive for oxacillin sensitive staphylococcus aureus. A PICC line was placed and he completed a 6 week course of IV clindamycin. Follow up x-rays 1 month post-op were normal. A full return to sports is expected. In children, osteomyelitis is primarily hematogenous in origin and affects the most vascularized regions of the growing skeleton. Complications of delayed diagnosis include growth arrest, septic arthritis and chronic infection. It is important to have a broad differential and high index of suspicion for conditions such as osteomyelitis as to prevent delays in diagnosis and treatment.

Ultrasonography may be a valuable screening tool for relative risk of noncontact knee injuries that occur over a typical playing career in collegiate American football players. In this prospective longitudinal study, we evaluated American football players (n = 48) in an academic institution affiliated with the National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I athletic program. Players underwent comprehensive ultrasonography of both knees prior to beginning their collegiate careers. Anatomic structures were evaluated for presence and severity of abnormalities. Noncontact lower extremity injuries sustained over the collegiate career of the subjects were documented. Data were analyzed for correlations, differences in proportions, and odds ratio (OR). Seventy-nine percent of the athletes had at least one ultrasonographic abnormality, with quadriceps tendon (47.9%) and patellar tendon (39.6%) abnormalities predominating. Seventy-nine percent of players had at least one noncontact lower extremity injury (23.5% involving the knee) during their careers with an average of 2.8 injuries per career. The majority of injuries occurred in the second and third playing years. There was a significantly higher likelihood of patellar tendon injury based on the presence of patellar tendon ultrasonographic pathology (p = 0.024; OR = 11x). There was a significantly higher likelihood of quadriceps muscle-tendon injury based on the presence of quadriceps tendon ultrasonography pathology (p = 0.0012; OR = 140x). All athletes sustaining meniscal injuries had preexisting joint effusion but no preexisting ultrasonographic meniscal pathology. Knee ultrasonography along with patient history and complete physical examination may help reduce injury risk through education, prevention, and training programs.","2019","2020-05-20 00:29:11","2020-05-20 00:29:11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L627296856; http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/s-0039-1683953","adult; female; human; male; article; football; clinical article; controlled study; prospective study; training; patellar ligament; longitudinal study; career; echography; knee injury; physical examination; medical history; education; congenital malformation; quadriceps tendon; tendon injury; joint effusion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

And as such, the role of the sport physiotherapist in the prevention, rehabilitation and management of sport injuries so grossly under estimated. The purpose of this study was to show the knowledge, and use of the Nigerian professional football league coaches on the role of physiotherapy in their various teams Methods: A 4 part structured questionnaire was used. It was adopted and modified from Motha (2009). A closed and open-ended pattern of questions was used for the survey. The questionnaire consisted of 36 questions divided into 4 · Section A sought demographic information of the participants which included age, gender and ethnicity. Years of experience in the profession, and number of physiotherapists in the team were also included.• Section B inquired about the occurrence of sport injuries, team manager's knowledge of prevention and management of injuries to measure the relevance of physiotherapy involvement. • Section C captured information on their knowledge of sports physiotherapy and the type of injuries that can be managed by physiotherapists. • Section D gathered information on the knowledge of the type of equipment used by physiotherapists. The data obtained from the participants by questionnaires was analysed descriptive (frequency and percentage scores). Results: The result showed that 90% of the coaches have a good knowledge of physiotherapy treatment and involvement, 6.7% have very good knowledge while 3.3% have a partial knowledge, 9 (60%) of the participants have some sports related qualifications. The study revealed that eight (53.3%) of the participants have physiotherapists as a part of their team while seven (46.7%) have no physiotherapists. Of the eight participants with physiotherapists, six (40%) have only one physiotherapist per team while two (13.3%) have more than one. 12 (80%) have worked for more than two years Conclusion(s): The managers have a good knowledge of physiotherapy involvement in football though most were untrained and lacked the basic qualifications in sports related courses. The study revealed that the team managers have good knowledge of the role of physiotherapy in football with regard to prevention and management of injuries. However, only 50% of the managers utilized physiotherapy services in their respective teams. Implications: Lack of professional expertise in the management of sports related injuries and lack of training in the managers could explain why the country has not achieved much at the global stage.

Twelve soccer players (9 males/3 females; 22.6 ± 2.3 y) participated in this study. Mechanical impact testing of each 3G surface; without (3G-NCU) and with cushioning underlay (3G-CU) were conducted.

For all tasks, greater peak resultant force, peak knee extensor moment and peak ankle dorsi-flexion moment were found in 3G-NCU than 3G-CU (p < 0.05). During 90CUT and STOP, loading rates were higher in 3G-NCU than 3G-CU (p < 0.05). During 180CUT, higher hip, knee and ankle ranges of motion were found in 3G-NCU (p < 0.05). These findings showed that the inclusion of cushioning underlay in 3G reduces impact loading forces and lower limb joint loading in soccer players across game-specific tasks. Overall, players were not attempting to reduce higher lower limb impact loading associated with a lack of surface cushioning underlay.","2019","2020-05-20 00:29:21","2020-05-20 00:29:21","","1-15","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14763141.2019.1579365; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L626971483","adult; female; human; male; article; soccer player; hip; knee; biomechanics; clinical article; controlled study; deceleration; ankle; range of motion; kinematics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: Collegiate female soccer and lacrosse players participated in this study. 18 athletes had at least 1 prior ACLI (age=20.6+1.3 yrs; height=169.0+6.0 cm; weight=65.7+6.1 kg), and 40 athletes had no prior ACLI (age=19.5+1.3 yrs; height=166.4+6.4 cm; weight=64.4+8.6 kg). Athletes completed 3 trials of a DVJ task. The involved limb was randomly assigned in those with no prior ACLI. Kinetics were collected via two inground force plates. Peak vertical ground reaction force (vGRF) of the involved limb, peak vGRF limb symmetry index (LSI), and time to peak vGRF of the involved limb were extracted and normalized to body weight (bw). Independent t-tests were calculated to compare each kinetic variable by ACLI history. Results: Those with a prior ACLI had lower peak vGRF in their involved limb (1.92 ± 0.48 bw) than those without ACLI (2.24 ± 0.55 bw); p=0.04. They had less limb symmetry of their peak vGRF (87.9 ± 25.8%) than those without (104.2 ± 21.8%; p=0.02). They reached this peak later after ground contact (58.1 ± 33.7 ms) than those without (44.0 ± 19.3 ms; p=.049). Conclusion: Females who play collegiate sports following ACLI have differences in their landing kinetics compared to their previously uninjured teammates. They have a lesser peak vGRF on their involved limb and take longer to reach this peak. These factors, combined with a greater asymmetry of the magnitude of this peak between limbs, suggest that they continue to offload and delay loading of their involved limb during double limb jumping tasks. Clinical implications: Even athletes who successfully play collegiate sports following ACLI have kinetic differences relative to their uninjured peers. Further research should explore how these differences affect future injury risk and long-term joint health.

In two studies, we investigated the influence of experiencing success or failure in a foosball (table soccer) game on participants' affective state and how this in turn influenced the way they report on the game itself. Winning or losing a match can further influence how they view their own team (compared to the opponent), which may also impact how they report on the match. In Study 1, we explored this by having participants play foosball matches in two dyads. They subsequently reported their affective state and team cohesiveness, and wrote two match reports, one from their own and one from their opponent's perspective. Indeed, while the game generally improved participants' moods, especially winning made them happier and more excited and losing made them more dejected, both in questionnaires and in the reports, which were analyzed with a word count tool. Study 2 experimentally investigated the effect of affective state on focus and distancing behavior. After the match, participants chose between preselected sentences (from Study 1) that differed in focus (mentioning the own vs. other team) or distancing (using we vs. the team name). Results show an effect for focus: winning participants preferred sentences that described their own performance positively while losing participants chose sentences that praised their opponent over negative sentences about themselves. No effect of distancing in pronoun use was found: winning and losing participants equally preferred the use of we vs. the use of their own team name. We discuss the implications of our findings with regard to models of language production, the self-serving bias, and the use of games to induce emotions in a natural way.","2019","2020-05-20 00:29:27","2020-05-20 00:29:27","","","","5","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0217419; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002028116","adult; female; human; human experiment; male; article; soccer; controlled study; questionnaire; mood; language; self serving bias","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This particular age group represent a 'forgotten' age, that is, they are largely ignored in academic scholarship, policy and physical activity provision. The paper explores how this group of women 're/engaged' in physical activity after a sustained period of inactivity. The study is situated in a weekly football initiative (Monday Night Footy) based in the north of England, managed and organised by a group of women for women to train and play five-a-side football. Data were generated through semi-structured interviews and the use of photo-biographical boards with 11 women, all of whom are regular participants to the football sessions. We use a middle ground feminist lens and Archer's notion of 'fr/agility' to help make sense of the women's experiences. From these women's stories three key findings emerge: (a) Biographies of (in)activity – the ways in which relationships with physical activity can be characterised by fractures and fissures despite seemingly positive early physical activity experiences; (b) Pathways of re/engagement – the motives and enablers to these women once again participating in physical activity after a sustained absence; and (c) Monday Night Footy as a space for re/engagement – the ways in which this context contributes to these women's continued involvement in football and broader physical activity. The paper concludes by offering policy makers and physical activity providers with some recommendations alongside considerations for future research.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the activation time of the quadriceps and hamstrings muscles during a movement that puts stress on anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) to assess the risk of ACL injury. DESIGN: Case series. SETTING: University laboratory for movement analysis. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: Twenty (10 males and 10 females) professional soccer players. INTERVENTION(S): An inertial sensor and 4 electrodes positioned on the quadriceps and hamstrings muscles were used for the surface electromyography. The athlete resting on 1 leg dropped, from a 32-cm-high platform, on the suspended foot (testing leg), without jumping or lowering his center of gravity and maintaining single-leg landing for 5 seconds. Using a software, it is possible to calculate the activation time of the rectus femoris, vastus medialis (VM), biceps femoris, and semimembranosus muscles before ground contact. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: To evaluate the activation times of the rectus femoris, VM, biceps femoris, and semitendinosus muscles before ground contact in comparison with the range of normality calculated by the manufacturer. RESULTS: All male soccer players demonstrated a low risk related to the correct activation of all the examined muscles, while female soccer players demonstrated delayed activation of the VM. CONCLUSIONS: Delayed activation of the VM registered in females determines an increase in anterior shear force, which is an important risk factor for incurring an ACL injury. This testing protocol becomes adequate for the screening of high-risk athletes and for targeting interventions to specific imbalances that may increase injury risk.","2019","2020-05-20 00:29:32","2020-05-20 00:29:32","","1-4","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1123/jsr.2019-0026; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629828667","adult; female; human; male; article; football; soccer player; clinical article; risk assessment; rectus femoris muscle; vastus medialis muscle; case study; anterior cruciate ligament injury; risk factor; jumping; kinematics; sensor; stress; foot; biceps femoris muscle; semitendinous muscle; electromyography; software; gravity; semimembranosus muscle; electrode","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Personal coaching is an emerging industry in many professional fields yet remains insignificant in sport coaching. The purpose of this study was to document and assess the value of a 12-month collaborative action research in which a high-performance rugby coach, with the support of a personal learning coach, aimed to learn from her coaching practice. This research was operationalized using an appreciative inquiry framework. Personal coaching was conducted according to the principles of narrative-collaborative coaching. Data collection included interviews, video observation, audio recordings of coaching conversations, notes from phone calls, and email exchanges. Results showed that this partnership created a safe and challenging learning space where different coaching topics were addressed, such as reflective practice, leadership, and mental preparation. A deductive analysis of the debriefing interview was completed using the value creation framework developed by Wenger and colleagues. This analysis indicated that the high-performance coach's relationship with the personal learning coach enabled the development of five types of value: immediate, potential, applied, realised, and transformative. Therefore, it is suggested that narrative-collaborative coaching can complement existing formal and non-formal learning activities.

Physical activity and exercise positively affects the expression of skeletal muscle markers involved in longevity pathways. Recently, a new mechanism, autophagy, was introduced to the adaptations induced by acute and chronic exercise as responsible of positive metabolic modification and health-longevity promotion. However, the molecular mechanisms regulating autophagy in response to physical activity and exercise are sparsely described. We investigated the long-term adaptations resulting from lifelong recreational football training on the expression of skeletal muscle markers involved in autophagy signaling. We demonstrated that lifelong football training increased the expression of messengers: RAD23A, HSPB6, RAB1B, TRAP1, SIRT2, and HSBPB1, involved in the auto-lysosomal and proteasome-mediated protein degradation machinery; of RPL1, RPL4, RPL36, MRLP37, involved in cellular growth and differentiation processes; of the Bcl-2, HSP70, HSP90, PSMD13, and of the ATG5-ATG12 protein complex, involved in proteasome promotion and autophagy processes in muscle samples from lifelong trained subjects compared to age-matched untrained controls. In conclusion, our results indicated that lifelong football training positively influence exercise-induced autophagy processes and protein quality control in skeletal muscle, thus promoting healthy aging.","2019","2020-05-20 00:29:59","2020-05-20 00:29:59","","","","","10","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2019.00132; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L627607649","adult; football player; human; human experiment; male; article; controlled study; normal human; biological marker; aged; protein expression; skeletal muscle; longevity; unclassified drug; signal transduction; autolysosome; autophagy (cellular); autophagy related protein 12; autophagy related protein 5; cell differentiation; cell growth; heat shock protein 70; heat shock protein 90; proteasome; protein bcl 2; protein degradation; protein HSBPB1; protein HSPB6; protein MRLP37; protein protein interaction; protein PSMD13; protein quality; protein RAB1B; protein RAD23A; protein RPL1; protein RPL36; protein RPL4; protein TRAP1; sirtuin 2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

CTE has been linked to disruptions in cognition, mood, and behavior. Unfortunately, the diagnosis of CTE can only be made post-mortem. Neuropathological evidence suggests limbic structures may provide an opportunity to characterize CTE in the living. Using 3 T magnetic resonance imaging, we compared select limbic brain regional volumes - the amygdala, hippocampus, and cingulate gyrus - between symptomatic former National Football League (NFL) players (n = 86) and controls (n = 22). Moreover, within the group of former NFL players, we examined the relationship between those limbic structures and neurobehavioral functioning (n = 75). The former NFL group comprised eighty-six men (mean age = 55.2 ± 8.0 years) with at least 12 years of organized football experience, at least 2 years of active participation in the NFL, and self-reported declines in cognition, mood, and behavior within the last 6 months. The control group consisted of men (mean age = 57.0 ± 6.6 years) with no history of contact-sport involvement or traumatic brain injury. All control participants provided neurobehavioral data. Compared to controls, former NFL players exhibited reduced volumes of the amygdala, hippocampus, and cingulate gyrus. Within the NFL group, reduced bilateral cingulate gyrus volume was associated with worse attention and psychomotor speed (r = 0.4 (right), r = 0.42 (left); both p < 0.001), while decreased right hippocampal volume was associated with worse visual memory (r = 0.25, p = 0.027). Reduced volumes of limbic system structures in former NFL players are associated with neurocognitive features of CTE. Volume reductions in the amygdala, hippocampus, and cingulate gyrus may be potential biomarkers of neurodegeneration in those at risk for CTE.","2019","2020-05-20 00:30:02","2020-05-20 00:30:02","","725-734","","3","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","","","","https://gateway.library.qut.edu.au/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=c8h&AN=136693244&site=ehost-live&scope=site","Football -- Physiology; Male; Football; Athletes; Middle Age; Basal Ganglia -- Pathology; Brain Concussion -- Complications; Cognition Disorders -- Diagnosis; Hippocampus -- Pathology; Limbic System -- Pathology; Limbic System -- Physiology; Magnetic Resonance Imaging -- Methods; Neurodegenerative Diseases -- Physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In a random order, twelve male soccer players performed a 5-m shuttle run test after a 10 min of WUMM, a 10 min of WUNM and a 10 min WUWM at 07 h00 and 17 h00. The higher distance (HD) and total distance (TD) were measured during the test, and the rated perceived exertion (RPE) and the feelings states (FS) were obtained immediately after the warm-up and the test. The results revealed that HD and TD were higher at 17 h00 than 07 h00 in all conditions (p <.01). At 07 h00 and 17 h00, TD and HD were higher after WUMM and WUNM than WUWM and after WUMM than WUNM (p <.01). This improvement was greater at 07 h00 than 17 h00 (e.g., 6.97% vs. 5.26% for TD). Moreover, FS were more positive after WUNM than WUWM only at 07 h00, after WUMM than WUWM at the two time-of-day (p <.01), and after WUMM than WUNM at 17 h00 (p <.01). After the 5-m shuttle run test, FS were more negative and the RPE scores were higher with WUMM than WUWM at 07 h00 (p <.01). The findings suggested that STMP and feelings depend on types of music listened during a warm-up. A warm-up with self-selected motivational-music improves STMP and feelings at 07 h00 and 17 h00 with greater enhancement in the morning.

Different tear types, defined by their tear location, require different preservation techniques: proximal and distal avulsion tears can be treated with arthroscopic primary repair, whereas primary repair with biological scaffold has been proposed for midsubstance tears. The goal of this study was to assess the distribution of different tear types in pediatric and adolescent patients, as these are currently unknown.Methods:A retrospective search in an institutional radiographic database was performed for patients under 18.0 years undergoing knee magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for ACL tears between June 2005 and June 2016. Patients with reports of chronic tears, partial tears, and multiligamentous injuries were excluded.Tear locations were graded using MRI as: proximal avulsion (distal remnant length >90% of total length; type I), proximal (75% to 90%; type II), midsubstance (25% to 75%; type III), distal (10% to 25%; type IV), and distal avulsion (<10%; type V).Results:A total of 274 patients (59% girls; mean±SD age, 15.1±2.1 y; range, 6.9 to 18.0 y) were included. Frequency of type I tears was 15%, type II 23%, type III 52%, type IV 1%, and type V 8% (of which 7% had bony avulsion).Prevalence of tear types varied with age. At age 6 to 10 years, 93% were type V (bony) avulsion tears. At age 11 to 13 years, 32% were type I, 16% type II, 32% type III, and 16% type V. At age 14 to 17 years, type III tears were more common (57%) than type I (14%), type II (25%) and type V (2%) tears.Conclusions:It was noted that the ACL was torn at different locations depending on the patients' age. These data provide more information on the potential application for ACL preservation in pediatric and adolescent patients. Future studies correlating these findings with arthroscopy are needed before using MRI for preoperative planning of ACL preservation surgery.Level of Evidence:Diagnostic level III.","2019","2020-05-20 00:30:07","2020-05-20 00:30:07","","441-448","","9","39","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/BPO.0000000000001041; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629515471","female; human; male; article; football; soccer; sport injury; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; basketball; priority journal; major clinical study; adolescent; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; retrospective study; child; prevalence; disease classification; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; skiing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This goal was achieved using the following methods: video recording, chronometry and by measuring the length of the step. The required data were acquired from the playback of the game videos of professional teams that participated in the study. In addition, we accounted for the pedometer information, performance of each player from these teams, and the data on the length of the step in all components of locomotor activities that were studied. Quantitative values of the main components of locomotor activities (walking, jogging, running, and sprinting) of the studied players from professional teams were established during the competitive period of 16 games. During the futsal game, the longest distance is covered by pivots, and a much shorter distance is covered by defenders. However, this distance is longer than that of goalkeepers. In the structure of pivots' locomotor activity, jogging is the dominant movement; for defenders -- running is dominant; for goalkeepers -- walking is dominant. During the game, pivots use jogging and sprinting more often than defenders, and defenders use walking and running more often than forwards. According to the study results, the shortcomings in locomotor activities of each player from the professional teams that participated in the study were determined in addition to possible areas of improvement. Coaches can benefit from these results to understand how players with different roles organize themselves during official matches. This will help develop training programs that will increase the effectiveness of technical and tactical training by taking into account the peculiarities of locomotor activities of futsal players.

A total of thirty-six healthy soccer players (mean age 17.81 ± 0.89 years, weight 65.95 ± 5.72 kg, height 177.06 ± 4.56 cm and BMI 22.1 ± 2 kg/m²) voluntarily participated in the present study. Participants randomly were divided into an experimental group (EG) and control group (CG). EG (n=14) used elevation training mask®2 (set-up as 2750 m altitude, wear in 3 workout a total of 270 min/week), while CG (n=22) didn't use ETM during interventions. Two groups completed the same soccer training program. Alactic anerobic power (ALAnPw), maximal oxygen use, fatigue index, average power output (APO), speed and flexibility of participants were evaluated. After carried-out a 2x2 ANOVA analysis for changes between pre-test and post-test values of two groups, there were no significant differences (p>0.05) of ALAnPw (F = 0.168, η² = 0.002), flexibility (F = 0.030, η² = 0.001), fatigue index (F = 0.036, η² = 0.001), APO (F = 0.029, η² = 0.001), VO2max (F = 0.382, η² = 0.011), and Speed (F = 0.023, η² = 0.001) between EG and CG. In conclusion, the use of ETM during soccer practices can increase physical performance of young soccer players. However, these improvements were not more than improvements in conventional conditions. Namen raziskave je bil preučiti učinke 6-tedenskega nogometnega treninga na fizično zmogljivost (FZ) nogometašev, starih 17-19 let, ki so med treningom nosili višinsko vadbeno masko (VVM). V raziskavi je prostovoljno sodelovalo skupno 36 zdravih nogometašev (povprečna starost 17,81 ± 0,89 let, teža 65,95 ± 5,72 kg, višina 177,06 ± 4,56 cm in BMI 22,1 ± 2 kg/m²). Merjenci so bili naključno razdeljeni v testno skupino (TS) in kontrolno skupino (KS). Člani TS (n = 14) so uporabljali višinsko vadbeno masko ®2 (nastavljeno na višino 2750 m, na treh vadbah, skupaj 270 min/teden), člani KS (n = 22) pa maske med intervencijami niso uporabljali. Obe skupini sta zaključili enak program nogometnega treninga. Merili smo alaktatno anaerobno moč (ALAnPw), maksimalno porabo kisika, indeks utrujenosti, povprečno izhodno moč (APO), hitrost in fleksibilnost. Potem ko smo za obe skupini opravili analizo sprememb med vrednostmi pred testom in po testu 2x2 ANOVA, med TS in KS nismo odkrili statistično značilnih razlik (p > 0,05) v ALAnPw (F = 0,168, η² = 0,002), fleksibilnosti (F = 0,030, η² = 0,001), indeksu utrujenosti (F = 0,036, η² = 0,001), APO (F = 0,029, η² = 0,001), VO2max (F = 0,382, η² = 0,011) in hitrosti (F = 0,023, η² = 0,001). Zaključili smo, da lahko uporaba višinske vadbene maske med nogometnim treningom poveča fizično zmogljivost mladih nogometašev. Vendar pa omenjene izboljšave niso bile več kot zgolj izboljšave v običajnih pogojih.","2019","2020-05-20 00:30:09","2020-05-20 00:30:09","","5-14","","2","25","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","","","","https://gateway.library.qut.edu.au/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=c8h&AN=140444202&site=ehost-live&scope=site","Soccer; Human; Adolescence; Athletic Performance -- Evaluation; Randomized Controlled Trials; Training Effect (Physiology); Fatigue; Oxygen Consumption -- Evaluation; Young Adult; Pretest-Posttest Design; Body Height; Body Mass Index; Body Weight; Physical Performance -- Evaluation; Time Factors; Altitude; Anoxia; Exercise Intensity -- Evaluation; Kinesiology; Masks; Physical Fitness -- Evaluation; Pliability -- Evaluation; Two-Way Analysis of Variance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The hippocampus is composed of several distinct subfields with possible differential susceptibility to injury. The aim of this study is to determine whether there are longitudinal changes in hippocampal subfield volume in collegiate football. A prospective cohort study was conducted over a 5-year period tracking 63 football and 34 volleyball male collegiate athletes. Athletes underwent high-resolution structural magnetic resonance imaging, and automated segmentation provided hippocampal subfield volumes. At baseline, football (n = 59) athletes demonstrated a smaller subiculum volume than volleyball (n = 32) athletes (-67.77 mm3; p = 0.012). A regression analysis performed within football athletes similarly demonstrated a smaller subiculum volume among those at increased concussion risk based on athlete position (p = 0.001). For the longitudinal analysis, a linear mixed-effects model assessed the interaction between sport and time, revealing a significant decrease in cornu ammonis area 1 (CA1) volume in football (n = 36) athletes without an in-study concussion compared to volleyball (n = 23) athletes (volume difference per year =-35.22 mm3; p = 0.005). This decrease in CA1 volume over time was significant when football athletes were examined in isolation from volleyball athletes (p = 0.011). Thus, this prospective, longitudinal study showed a decrease in CA1 volume over time in football athletes, in addition to baseline differences that were identified in the downstream subiculum. Hippocampal changes may be important to study in high-contact sports.","2019","2020-05-20 00:30:11","2020-05-20 00:30:11","","2762-2773","","19","36","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2018.6357; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629545204","adult; football player; human; male; article; football; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; brain concussion; clinical article; sport; adolescent; cohort analysis; longitudinal study; volleyball; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; regression analysis; entorhinal cortex; hippocampus; time; brain size; dentate gyrus; hippocampal CA1 region; image segmentation; MR 750; perirhinal cortex; subiculum","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Understanding the longitudinal development of physical traits in junior players, alongside the moderating effect of simultaneous increases in body mass, can aid in improving programming and ultimately help junior players prepare for the demands of senior rugby. The purpose of this study was to investigate the longitudinal physical development of elite adolescent backs and forwards in a professional rugby union academy. METHODS: A total of 15 players (age, 17.0 [0.2] y; body mass, 90 [14] kg; height, 183 [9] cm; n = 7 backs, n = 8 forwards) completed anthropometric measures and 3 primary performance assessments (countermovement jump, Yo-Yo intermittent recovery test level 1, and 10-m speed) at baseline, year 2, and year 3. Mixed modelling was used to assess player development over time and differences in this development by playing position. Magnitude-based inferencing was used to assess the uncertainty in the effects. RESULTS: There was a substantial increase in countermovement jump height for both groups combined (0.9, ±0.4; standardized improvement, ±90% confidence limits; most likely substantial). Forwards exhibited a moderate-sized decrease in speed (-1.0, ±0.5; very likely substantial), and there was a large difference between groups with regards to speed change with backs outperforming forwards (1.5, ±0.9; very likely substantial). For forward, body mass change had a large negative association with 10-m speed (-1.9, ±0.7; most likely substantial) and Yo-Yo intermittent recovery test level 1 change (-1.2, ±0.9; very likely substantial). CONCLUSION: These findings provide novel normative data for longitudinal changes in junior rugby union players and suggest that coaches should account for changes in body mass when targeting increases in speed and aerobic fitness.","2019","2020-05-20 00:30:12","2020-05-20 00:30:12","","1-8","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1123/ijspp.2019-0154; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629738384","female; human; male; article; rugby; acceleration; aerobic capacity; clinical article; controlled study; adolescent; physical development; physical well-being; uncertainty","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A series of hierarchical linear modelling analyses were conducted upon the 9 measurement times to: (a) examine the relationships between appraisals (threat, challenge, loss), pleasant (happiness, excitement) and unpleasant (anxiety, dejection, anger) emotions, and emotional regulation strategies (adaptive and less adaptive); and (b) ascertain whether the relationships between appraisals and emotions were mediated by emotion regulation strategies. The results of the random coefficient regression models showed: (a) positive relationships between challenge appraisal, adaptive emotion regulation, and pleasant emotions as well as between threat and loss appraisals, less adaptive emotion regulation and unpleasant emotions; and (b) mediating effects of emotional regulation strategies in the appraisals - emotions relationships. As a whole, this study furthered knowledge base about the competitive environment in showing that appraisals, emotion regulation and emotions are intertwined psychological constructs in a dynamic relationship allowing athletes to continuously adjust to their constantly changing everyday demands.","2019","2020-05-20 00:30:14","2020-05-20 00:30:14","","1-12","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02640414.2019.1662538; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629269086","female; human; male; theoretical study; article; soccer player; clinical article; season; adolescent; anxiety; disease simulation; anger; emotionality; excitement; happiness; knowledge base","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Purpose: To describe the epidemiology of back injuries in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) football players during the 2009/2010 through 2013/2014 academic years utilizing the NCAA Injury Surveillance Program (ISP) database. Study Design: Descriptive epidemiology study. Methods: A convenience sample of NCAA varsity football teams was utilized to determine the rates and patterns of back injuries as well as to generate national injury estimates. The rates and distribution of back injuries were identified within the context of mechanism of injury, injury chronicity, and time lost from sport. Injury rates were calculated as the number of injuries divided by the total number of athlete-exposures (AEs). Incidence rate ratios were calculated to compare the rates of injury between season, event type, mechanism of injury, injury chronicity, and time lost from sport. Results: Nationally, there were 267 low back injuries reported in the database. These were used to estimate 7076 back injuries over the 5-year period, approximately 82% of which were new injuries. The injuries occurred at a rate of 2.70 per 10,000 AEs. Overall, injuries were 3.12 times more likely to occur in competitions than in practices. Athletes were 4.67 times more likely to sustain a back injury during the preseason compared with the postseason but were 1.41 times more likely to sustain a low back injury during the preseason compared with the regular season. Both contact and noncontact were reported equally as the mechanism of injury (37.8% and 38.3%, respectively), and unspecified low back pain was the most common injury (64.2%). Only 1.6% of patients required surgery for their injury, and the majority of athletes (59.6%) returned to play within 24 hours. Conclusion: There was a relatively high rate of lumbar back injuries at the collegiate level (2.70/10,000 AEs), the majority of which were new injuries. About 18% of reported injuries were reinjuries. Although very few required surgery, a careful examination and work-up should be conducted to evaluate each injury.

The neuromuscular deficits that often manifest during maturation in young, female athletes may be exacerbated in athletes who specialize in a single sport. The purpose of this study was to investigate if sport specialization is associated with increased lower extremity biomechanical deficits pre-to post-puberty in adolescent female athletes. Seventy-nine sport-specialized female adolescent (Mean ± SD age = 13.4 ± 1.8 years) basketball, soccer, and volleyball athletes were identified and matched with seventy-nine multi-sport (soccer, basketball, and volleyball) female athletes from a database of 1,116 female adolescent basketball, soccer, and volleyball athletes who were enrolled in one of two large prospective, longitudinal studies. The athletes were assessed over two visits (Mean ± SD time = 724.5 ± 388.7 days) in which they were classified as pre-pubertal and post-pubertal, respectively. Separate 2 × 2 analyses of covariance were used to compare sport-specialized and multi-sport groups and dominant/non-dominant limbs with respect to pubertal changes in peak knee sagittal, frontal, and transverse plane joint angular measures and moments of force recorded while performing a drop vertical jump task. The sport-specialized group were found to exhibit significantly larger post-pubertal increases in peak knee abduction angle (p = 0.005) and knee abduction moment (p = 0.006), as well as a smaller increase in peak knee extensor moment (p = 0.032) during landing when compared to the multi-sport group. These biomechanical changes are indicative of potentially compromised neuromuscular control that may increase injury risk pre-to post-puberty in sport-specialized female athletes. Consideration of maturation status may be an important factor in assessing the injury risk profiles of adolescent athletes who specialize in sport.","2019","2020-05-20 00:30:21","2020-05-20 00:30:21","","","","JUN","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fped.2019.00268; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628453900","female; human; human experiment; article; lower limb; soccer; sport injury; knee; biomechanics; basketball; sport; adolescent; athlete; cohort analysis; risk assessment; longitudinal study; volleyball; jumping; task performance; neuromuscular function; puberty","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the limitation of previous research has been that conclusions are often drawn from male dominated cohorts, without the consideration of differences between the sexes. This may potentially nullify differences between groups and produce results that may not be generalisable to women. Therefore, the aim of the study was to investigate the differences between men and women with HRP in lower limb biomechanics during walking and a single leg drop jump (SLDJ). Methods: Football players (Soccer and Australian Football), aged 18–50 years with a 6-month history of HRP were eligible to participate. Participants completed the Copenhagen Hip and Groin Outcome Score (HAGOS) to quantify symptoms. Biomechanical data was collected using a 10-camera opto-reflective motion capture system and two in-series force plates. Participants completed two tasks of differing vertical-force magnitude (walking and SLDJ). Lower limb biomechanics (joint angles, moments and impulse) were calculated at the hip, knee and ankle and participants were stratified by sex for analysis. Joint angles and moments were analysed using two-samples t-tests via statistical parametric mapping and Impulse data were analysed using a two-samples t-test in R. Results: Sixty-five men and 23 women participated with no difference between groups for HAGOS scores (p > 0.07). Walking: During stance, men with HRP walked with less hip flexion (p < 0.01) and internal rotation (p < 0.01). Men also produced a greater dorsi flexion moment (p < 0.01) and impulse (p < 0.01) at the ankle compared to women. SLDJ: Men with HRP completed the SLDJ with less hip flexion in early stance (p = 0.03) and a greater external knee flexion moment (p < 0.01). In addition, men also produced a greater dorsi flexion moment (p < 0.01) and impulse (p = 0.01) at the ankle compared to women. Discussion: Men and women with HRP report similar levels of disability yet produce differing lower limb biomechanics during both high- and low-impact tasks. Differences were task specific at the hip and knee yet consistent across tasks at the ankle. These results demonstrate that sex may be an effect modifier in HRP. The use of mixed cohorts without appropriate between sex considerations should be strongly discouraged in biomechanical evaluations of people with HRP and future research should determine if sex dependent prevention and intervention strategies are required.","2019","2020-05-20 00:30:23","2020-05-20 00:30:23","","S70-S71","","","22","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsams.2019.08.282; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002914850","adult; conference abstract; female; football player; human; male; soccer; hip; biomechanics; controlled study; major clinical study; cohort analysis; young adult; walking; sex difference; inguinal region; ankle; knee function; rotation; pain; standing; disability; imaging software; motion analysis system","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As such, the movement strategies of women with HRP are not well understood. Therefore, the aim of the study was to compare the mechanical work completed by the lower limb joints during the single leg drop jump (SLDJ) in women with and without HRP. Methods: Female football players, aged 18-50 years, with and without HRP were eligible to participate. Twenty-three women with HRP and 13 controls participated. Biomechanical data on the SLDJ were collected using a three-dimensional motion capture system and force plates. Total lower limb work was calculated as well as the relative contributions of the hip, knee and ankle. Differences between group were assessed using t-tests. Results: The relative contribution to negative work done at the knee was significantly less in the women with HRP compared with the control group (mean difference -4.7%, 95%CI -9.1, -0.3; P=0.04). When comparing contributions across the three joints, the ankle provided the largest contribution to positive work for the HRP group (36.8%), with the hip being the largest contributor in the controls (35.4%). Conclusions: Women with HRP absorbed significantly less energy at the knee compared to healthy controls. The reason why women with HRP do not use a knee dominant strategy for absorbing energy during the SLDJ requires further scrutiny. Despite no difference in total positive work between groups, we did observe some subtle differences amongst the joints in the relative contributions to positive work done. The ankle was the dominant source of positive work during the SLDJ for women with HRP, whereas the hip was for controls. This strategy adopted by women with HRP may be an attempt to 'offload' the symptomatic hip. Clinical implications: The study demonstrates potential impairments that can be addressed in rehabilitation programs to normalise force attenuation and propulsive strategies in women with HRP.

The most commonly injured joint in male and female football players is the knee joint. It has been reported that approximately 60-85% of football injuries occur in the lower limbs. The aim of this study is to present the methods of biomechanical assessment of lower limbs joint lo ading during specific tasks (single leg squat (SLS) and single leg landing (SLL)). In this experimental setup, Qualisys Tracking Motion system synchronised with AMTII force plates embedded into the floor was used. The marker setup Salford Lower Limb model was used to track pelvis and lower body movements. By analysing biomechanical parameters (range of motion, internal moments, power, ground reaction forces) in all three planes it is possible to identify the structures and the imbalances of the lower extremity that need intervention and further decrease the possibility of injury to the knee and to evaluate an appropriate moment of return to play. This method showed a very high reproducibility and it can be considered as a reliable tool in assessing lower limb performance tasks.

Therefore, we examined the effects of a 5-min halftime LLC (7.5 ± 1.0 °C; bare feet immersed up to the tibial tuberosity), as a recovery strategy on subsequent performance changes in the second-half. Methods: Twenty male elite football players (age: 19 ± 1 years; height: 176 ± 6 cm; mass: 69 ± 7 kg; athletic career: 9 ± 1 years) participated in this crossover study (LLC or passive recovery: sitting on a bench without cooling). The 5-min FSP with a fixed intensity and distance, consisted of football-related activities (two trials of sprinting, jumping, dribbling, and kicking in various intensities and distances) and was repeated nine times (total 45-min) to mimic the first- and second-half of a football match. Calorie expenditure, heart rate, athletic performance, and passing accuracy were recorded. To determine feasibility, we compared our data to the normative values in previous reports. To test the condition effects over time, we performed a 2 x 6 mixed model analysis of variance for calorie expenditure and heart rate. For athletic performance and passing accuracy, we performed a 2 x 6 mixed model analysis of covariance (covariate: baseline measurement). Results: There were no statistical differences between the LLC condition and passive recovery on athletic performance and passing accuracy at any time point (p > 0.13 for all statistical tests). Recorded calorie expenditure (1,227 ± 142 kcal) and heart rate (163 ± 11 bpm) during our FSP were within the normative values of a typical football match (calorie expenditure: 1,200 to 1,500 kcal; heart rate: 150 and 175 bpm). Conclusions: Since a 5-min halftime LLC (at 7.5 °C) immersed up to the tibial tuberosity are not effective in delaying fatigue and passing accuracy, it is not recommended for a recovery strategy. Since simulated football matches using the FSP were similar to a typical football match in terms of calorie expenditure and heart rate, it could be used for future research or training purposes.

However, the results obtained in female soccer players are scarce and controversial. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine how explosive strength and agility are affected by a 12-week plyometric training program in elite female soccer players. Twenty-eight adult female players were randomly assigned into 2 groups: control group (CG, n = 14, age 26.7 ± 5.3 years) and plyometric group (PG, n = 14; age 26.5 ± 6.9 years). The intervention was performed during the second part of the competitive season. Both groups performed technical and tactical training exercises and matches together. However, the CG followed the regular soccer physical conditioning program, which was replaced by a plyometric program for PG. Neither CG nor PG performed weight training. Plyometric training was carried out 3 days a week for 12 weeks including jumps over hurdles, drop jumps in stands, or horizontal jumps. At baseline and after training all participants were tested on the countermovementjump height (cm)and agility T-test time (s).The PG group showed significantly (p< 0.001) improvement than CG in the countermovementjump (3.1 ± 2.4 vs. 0.6 ± 1.2 cm) and T-test (-0.2 ± 0.2 vs. 0.0 ± 0.2 s) following training. Our findings highlight that plyometric training can improve explosive strength in female soccer players, and, most importantly, these improvements concern the jumping ability and sprinting speed with direction changes, power-related components of soccer thought to be necessary for success. We strongly recommend that soccer coaches implement in-season plyometric training to enhance the performance of their players.

The present research addresses this issue by exploring the extent to which high-quality athlete leadership is associated with elite athletes' health and burnout. Participants (120 male athletes from three top-division Australian football teams) were asked to rate the quality of each of their teammates in four different leadership roles (i.e., as task and motivational leaders on the field and as social and external leaders off the field), and also to indicate their identification with their team as well as their self-reported health and burnout. Findings indicated that (a) being seen to be a good athlete leader by other members of the team and (b) having a good athlete leader on the team were both positively associated with better team member health and lower burnout. This relationship was mediated by athletes' identification with their team, suggesting that leaders enhance athletes' health and reduce athlete burnout by creating and maintaining a sense of shared identity in their team. This, in turn, suggests that coaches can foster an optimal team environment by developing the leadership potential of their athlete leaders - in particular, their skills that foster a sense of shared team identification. This is in the interests not only of team performance but also of team members' health and burnout.","2019","2020-05-20 00:30:38","2020-05-20 00:30:38","","1-28","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17461391.2019.1680736; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629578301","adult; human; male; article; elite athlete; football; skill; social status; leadership; burnout; overexertion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

History was provided by referee, close spectators and later contribution by the patient. Patient had made a tackle on an opposing player, which resulted in the opponent falling onto the patient's head while supine on the ground. From the moment the tackle was made, the patient lay motionless on the field in the supine position. At this point EMS and team physician were called. There were no reports of previous injuries or head trauma prior to this event and no report of altered mentation, shortness of breath or chest pain. In primary survey the patient made no voluntary or involuntary movements, was unresponsive and nonverbal. With C-spine precautions, the patient was immobilized and transported emergently. Physical Exam: Constitutional: Patient is on a spine board, with cervical collar in place. No acute distress. GCS 9 (E1V2M6) HENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic. Mouth/Throat: Oropharynx is clear and moist. Eyes: Pupils are equal, round and reactive to light. Conjunctivae normal. Fluttering eye movements are noted, but pupils are equal and reactive. Extraocular movements are conjugate but does not track. Neck: In cervical collar, moans when palpated, no deformity or crepitus. CV: RRR, no m/g/r. Pulmonary: CTAB, no labored breathing. Abdomen: Benign. Neuro: No tonic/clonic movements, no posturing. No spontaneous movement of limbs. Does squeeze with left hand when instructed. LE reflexes 21 symmetric. Differential Diagnosis: Cervical Spine Injury Closed Head Trauma, Hemorrhage/Hematoma Seizure Disorder Cardiac Arrhythmia Vertebral Artery Dissection Test Results: EKG: Normal Sinus rhythm, rate 87 bpm. Laboratory testing: complete metabolic panel, CBC, PT/PTT/INR, Magnesium, CK-MB, creatine kinase, troponin I, Urinalysis, urine pregnancy all within normal limits. negative EtOH and Urine drug screen. Imaging: CT head, CT c-spine, CT angiogram head, Ct angiogram neck, MRI brain, MRI c-spine ALL read with normal findings without evidence of acute or chronic disease and without abnormality. Final Diagnosis: Mild TBI with post-traumatic seizure and post-concussive syndrome. Discussion: This case is important due to the unique presentation and multitude of possible diagnoses that must be considered when managing an acute injury. The patient presented with concerning history of head and neck injury and was unresponsive, which should always be managed with the assumption of catastrophic closed head injury or spinal injury. With limited history in a case such as this we must be broad in consideration of the etiology of collapse and unresponsiveness. Concussion, a far more common diagnosis in the athlete, must be the diagnosis of exclusion in these cases. Outcome: As mentioned, the patient was admitted for observation and further diagnostic workup. From presenting exam, the patient made rapid and progressive improvements in alertness, speech and strength within hours to days. After thorough investigation to rule out spinal or intracranial abnormality or medical cause for symptoms, she was discharged 2 days later with the diagnosis of concussion. Follow-up: After hospital discharge, the patient had close follow up with sports medicine. Serial Neurologic examinations and SCAT-5 assessments were performed over the subsequent weeks. She was held from all athletic participation. The patient did have noticeably slowed speech that persisted for 9 days after the event and significant symptoms for 2 weeks. She was completely symptom free at 5 weeks.","2019","2020-05-20 00:30:39","2020-05-20 00:30:39","","e26-e27","","2","29","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/JSM.0000000000000728; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629860295","sports medicine; adult; conference abstract; female; human; rugby; Caucasian; case report; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; clinical article; athlete; young adult; follow up; outcome assessment; electrocardiogram; supine position; physician; creatine kinase; human tissue; surgery; physical examination; heart arrhythmia; hospital discharge; magnesium; medical history; endogenous compound; chronic disease; dyspnea; hand; diagnosis; differential diagnosis; reflex; alcohol; acute disease; laboratory test; thorax pain; sinus rhythm; alertness; thinking; cervical spine injury; spine board; neurologic examination; mouth; urinalysis; cervical collar; deformity; postconcussion syndrome; hematoma; abdomen; distress syndrome; eye movement; artery dissection; cetrimide; collapse; conjugate; creatine kinase MB; international normalized ratio; involuntary movement; oropharynx; pregnancy; seizure; speech; throat; troponin I; voluntary movement","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A similar lack of succession benefits has been reported in studies of manager and CEO succession: it has not been established that changing a team's leader improves a declining team's performance. We study the effect of a change of coach on the performance of a professional soccer team. Based on rarely obtained access to a whole season (one year) of daily close observation of the team and coaching staff in practice and matches, this study uses quantitative and qualitative data to go beyond the “average” pattern reported in the literature. We document in detail how, in a single team case study over an entire season, the processes in leadership behavior changed with a change of coach, the effect this had on the state of mind of the team, how the match behaviors of the players changed, and how these changes translated into improved performance. The process effects of a leadership change on the performance of a sports team may hold insights for leader succession in management: in addition to the aggregate organizational and experience fit of the new team leader, the specific leadership processes introduced by the new leader are critical for performance effects.","2019","2020-05-20 00:30:43","2020-05-20 00:30:43","","","","3","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0212634; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2001700748","human; article; soccer; season; leadership; staff","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We compared fouls and cards in the English Premier League (EPL) with the next three divisions of English soccer over 17 seasons (2000/01–2016/17), to determine whether previously observed differences with other top European leagues are unique to the EPL or are characteristic of English professional soccer overall. Methods: Data from individual matches were obtained through online sources and season averages for each league were compared. Fouls and cards were also compared between home and away teams. Correlations with final league positions were examined. Results: Numbers of fouls and yellow cards per match did not substantially differ between leagues, with average differences of 3–3.8% and 6.1–14.0% (effect sizes (ηp2) < 0.01). Away teams consistently committed more fouls and yellow card offences than home teams in each league. Results were similar though less consistent for red cards. Number and rate of cards awarded to the opposition exhibited strongest correlations with final league position across leagues. Conclusions: Our results suggest similar rates of aggressive play among the top English soccer leagues, possibly due to standardized refereeing style. Consequently, contact injuries rates may be higher in English soccer.

In this study, the authors examine the market disruption of college football protests, under the belief the ability of market disruption can play a significant role for activism movements to challenge authority as well as expand opportunity for social change. Specifically considering game attendance as an important form of market demand, the authors employ regression modeling to analyze the relationship between game attendance and protests organized to struggle against racial injustices by football players at four Division I Football Bowl Subdivision programs. The results from the empirical models suggest that the voting demographics of the local market a team plays in have a significant relationship with attendance after a protest, with some schools experiencing declines in consumer interest. Results advance the current inquiry of athlete activism through an economic lens, which contributes to further discussions on the empowerment of athletes and their roles in social activism.

Aim: To investigate in Masters-age footballers, cardiac risk factors, symptoms, knowledge and understanding, and support for prevention. Methods: A web-based survey (Masters Age Footballers and Cardiac Risk (MAFACARI)) of 153 Sydney footballers (age 49 ± 8 years, 92% males); A-grade competition (n = 24), ≤B-grade (n = 95), or social (n = 34). Combined group data are shown. Knowledge, attitudes and beliefs were assessed by the ACS Response Index. Results: Most were Caucasian (89%), tertiary educated (90%), motivated by social interaction/enjoyment (94%) and health/exercise (90%). Risk factors: overweight-obese (54%), hypercholesterolaemia (37%), family history (23%), hypertension (20%), current smoker (8%), and prior PTCA/cardiac surgery (5%). 33 (22%) reported ≥1 potential cardiac symptom during activity in prior year but only 8 of them (24%) sought medical attention. Knowledge score was 13.7 ± 2.3 (range 8–20), Attitudes 11.9 ± 2.7 (5–18) Beliefs 22.1 ± 3.2 (16–28). Knowledge was high (≥80%) for typical heart attack (MI) symptoms but poorer (<40%) for atypical ones. Only half felt confident to recognise MI. 45% preferred someone drive them to hospital than wait for an ambulance. 46% were less likely to stop playing with pain/discomfort during a final. Only 40% were aware that warning signs may precede MI by days or longer. Strong support was expressed for AED and CPR training (99%), AEDs at games (97%), and education (>90%). Conclusion: Cardiac risk factors and potential symptoms are common in Masters footballers, with gaps in knowledge and understanding. Players strongly support AED availability and training, and cardiac education.","2019","2020-05-20 00:30:52","2020-05-20 00:30:52","","S368","","","28","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.hlc.2019.06.547; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002234414","adult; conference abstract; female; football player; human; male; soccer; Caucasian; exercise; controlled study; major clinical study; competition; attention; risk factor; surgery; pain; hypertension; middle aged; education; smoking; obesity; family history; ambulance; heart disease; heart infarction; heart surgery; hypercholesterolemia; social interaction; transluminal coronary angioplasty","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Materials and Methods: Eighty-nine Rugby Union players were monitored over two seasons of training and competition. Load was measured for all training sessions and matches using subjective [session ratings of perceived exertion (sRPE) load; RPE × session duration] and objective [global positioning systems (GPS); distance and high-speed running distance] methods and quantified using multiple approaches; absolute match and training load, acute:chronic workload ratio (ACWR), exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) and cumulative 7, 14, 21, and 28 d sums. Mixed effect models were used to assess the effect of each variable on time-loss incidence. Results: Of the 474 time-loss incidences that occurred across the two seasons, 50.0% were contact injuries (86.5% occurred during matches and 13.5% during training), 34.8% were non-contact injuries (31.5% occurred during matches and 68.5% during training) and 15.2% were cases of illness. The absolute match and training load variables provided the best explanation of the variance in time-loss incidence occurrence [sRPE load: p < 0.001, Akaike information criterion (AIC) = 2936; distance: p < 0.001, AIC = 3004; high-speed running distance: p < 0.001, AIC = 3025]. The EWMA approach (EWMA sRPE load: p < 0.001, AIC = 2980; EWMA distance: p < 0.001, AIC = 2980; EWMA high-speed running distance: p = 0.002, AIC = 2987) also explained more of the variance in time-loss incidence occurrence than the ACWR approach (ACWR sRPE load: p = 0.091, AIC = 2993; ACWR distance: p = 0.008, AIC = 2990; ACWR high-speed running distance: p = 0.153, AIC = 2994). Conclusion: Overall, the absolute sRPE load variable best explained the variance in time-loss incidence, followed by absolute distance and absolute high-speed running distance. Whilst the model fit using the EWMA approach was not as good as the absolute load variables, it was better than when the same variables were calculated using the ACWR method. Overall, these findings suggest that the absolute match and training load variables provide the best predictors of time-loss incidence rates, with sRPE load likely to be the optimal variant of those examined here.","2019","2020-05-20 00:30:53","2020-05-20 00:30:53","","","","","10","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2019.01413; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L630045258","adult; human; article; rugby; sport injury; controlled study; incidence; major clinical study; prospective study; workload; training; competition; athlete; cohort analysis; prediction; running; velocity; global positioning system; mathematical analysis; mathematical model; training load; mathematical computing; time; mathematical parameters; session ratings of perceived exertion load; statistical parameters; time loss incidence","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Hooper-Index and resting HRV were collected on matchday and on the four following days in three consecutive in-season weeks in nine players (25.2 ± 4.3-years). The usefulness of monitoring variables was assessed by (a) comparing noise (typical error, TE) to the smallest worthwhile change (SWC) (TE/SWC) and (b) comparing match-related changes (i.e., signal) to TE (i.e., signal-to-noise ratio). Between-days standardized differences in the changes of Hooper-Index and HRV were compared to the SWC using magnitude-based inferences. The magnitudes of TE were small and moderate for the Hooper-Index and HRV, respectively. The Hooper-Index showed to be more useful than HRV for monitoring match-induced fatigue as having a lower TE/SWC (3.1 versus 4.4) and a higher signal-to-noise ratio (5.5 versus 1.5). Small-to-very large [range of effect sizes, 0.48; 2.43, confidence limits (0.22; 2.91)] and moderate-to-large [-1.71; -0.61 (-2.44; -0.03)] detrimental changes in Hooper-Index and HRV, respectively, were observed on the days following matchday. While group analyses showed a similar pattern for recovery time-course, more individual players responded, similarly when tracked using the Hooper -Index compared to when they were tracked using HRV. An inverse moderate within-individual relationship was observed between changes in the Hooper index and HRV [r = -0.41, (-0.60, 0.18)]. The Hooper index is an easy-to-use, no-cost, and non-invasive monitoring tool and seems promising for tracking match-induced fatigue during in the season in professional soccer.","2019","2020-05-20 00:30:55","2020-05-20 00:30:55","","","","FEB","10","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2019.00109; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L627780193","adult; human; article; soccer; clinical article; controlled study; standardization; competition; athlete; fatigue; effect size; resting heart rate; heart rate variability; time factor; clinical assessment tool; analytical error; biological monitoring; Hooper Index; non invasive procedure; recovery time course; signal noise ratio","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, this study profiled the match-day physical activities performed by soccer substitutes, focusing separately on the pre and post pitch-entry periods. Seventeen English Championship soccer players were monitored using 10 Hz Micromechanical Electrical Systems (MEMS) devices during 13 matches in which they participated as substitutes (35 observations). Twenty physical variables were examined and data were organised by bouts of warm-up activity (pre pitch-entry), and five min epochs of match-play (post pitch-entry). Linear mixed modelling assessed the influence of time (i.e., ‘bout’ and ‘epoch’), playing position, and match scoreline. Substitutes performed 3±1 rewarm-up boutsplayer-1match-1. Compared to the initial warm-up, each rewarm-up was shorter (-19.7 to -22.9 min) and elicited less distance (-606 to -741 m), whilst relative total distances were higher (+26 to +69 mmin-1). Relative total (+13.4 mmin-1) and high-speed (+0.4 mmin-1) distances covered during rewarm-ups increased (p <0.001) with proximity to pitch-entry. Players covered more (+3.2 m; p = 0.047) high-speed distance per rewarm-up when the assessed team was losing compared with when winning at the time of pitch-entry. For 10 out of 20 variables measured after pitch-entry, values reduced from 0–5 min thereafter, and substitutes covered greater (p <0.05) total (+67 to +93 m) and high-speed (+14 to +33 m) distances during the first five min of match-play versus all subsequent epochs. Midfielders covered more distance (+41 m) per five min epoch than both attackers (p <0.001) and defenders (p = 0.016). Acknowledging the limitations of a solely movement data approach and the potential influence of other match-specific factors, such findings provide novel insights into the match-day demands faced by substitute soccer players. Future research opportunities exist to better understand the match-day practices of this population.","2019","2020-05-20 00:30:58","2020-05-20 00:30:58","","","","1","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0211563; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L626163144","human; article; soccer player; physical activity; controlled study; velocity; warm up; pitch; physical examination","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The sample consisted of 130 male athletes from a professional football club in Porto Alegre. The study variables were: flexibility (sit and reach); aerobic resistance (Yo-Yo Test); explosive strength of lower limbs (vertical jumps - CMJ and free); maximum power, relative power and fatigue index (Test R.A.S.T.); displacement speed (sprints of 10m and 20m) and the maturational status by self-assessment in the Tanner photometer. To verify the effects of maturation on the study variables we used the Factorial ANOVA test. A significant and moderate effect of the biological maturation on the conditional capacities (flexibility: ηp² = 0.31, aerobic resistance: ηp² = 0.25, explosive force CMJ: ηp² = 0.29, free jump: ηp² = 0, The maximum power: ηp² = 0.36, relative power: ηp² = 0.35, and fatigue index: ηp² = 0.40, displacement velocity 20m: ηp² = 0.47, (p ≤ 0.05). Conclusion: the influence of biological maturation on the variables associated with the athletes' sporting performance in these football base categories suggests an individual observation of the training responses and their progression according to the changes in the maturational stage.

Twenty football competitive boys (mean age 14 ± 0 yrs; height 165.5 ± 8.5 cm; weight 59.9 ± 9.5 kg; years of training 7 ± 3) and eighteen untrained school boys (mean age 14 ± 0; height 168.22 ± 10.46 cm; weight 59.3 ± 9.9 kg) of the same biological age volunteered to participate in the study. Sexual maturation classified according to Tanner's stage 3. The football players participated both in their school's physical education program and in their football team training program while the untrained group participated only in their school's physical education program (2-3 times per week for 40 min). All subjects were tested for maximal oxygen uptake (VO2) and respiratory exchange ratio (RER) on the treadmill using an open circuit spirometry. The isokinetic peak torque values of quadriceps (Q) and hamstrings (H) as well as the H : Q strength ratios were recorded. Hcon: Qcon was calculated as the ratio of the peak concentric torque of H to the peak concentric torque of the Q. Results showed that the trained group had significantly lower heart rate in rest (p < 0.001), higher RER (p < 0.001), maximal blood lactate (BLmax) (p < 0.001) and higher (VO2) max in both relative and absolute values (p < 0.001) compared to the untrained group. At angular velocities of 60° s-1 and 180° s-1 the relative peak torque of Q and H were significantly higher (Q = p < 0.01; H = p < 0.01). However, the absolute values of Q and H as well as the H : Q ratios at all angular velocities did not differ significantly between the two groups. The results suggest that systematic football training (intensity and duration) has a positive effect in metabolic capacity, cardiorespiratory system and neuromuscular function.

A selective influence of the maximum acceleration ability on speed-power tests was observed, as the higher acceleration group demonstrated likely to almost certain higher performances than the lower acceleration group in all measurements (effect sizes varying from 0.66 [for sprint momentum in 20-m] to 2.39 [for sprint velocity in 5-m]). Conversely, the higher acceleration group demonstrated a higher COD deficit when compared to the lower acceleration group (ES = 0.55). This indicates compromised efficiency to perform COD maneuvers in this group of players. In summary, it was observed that soccer players with higher maximum acceleration rates are equally able to jump higher, sprint faster (over short distances), and achieve higher COD velocities than their slower counterparts. However, they appear to be less efficient at changing direction, which may be related to their reduced ability to deal with greater entry and exit velocities, or counterbalance the associated mechanical consequences (i.e., greater inertia) of being faster and more powerful.","2019","2020-05-20 00:31:04","2020-05-20 00:31:04","","","","5","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0216806; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2001972535","adult; human; male; article; soccer player; acceleration; exercise; controlled study; effect size","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The meta-analysis was based on 16 studies, employing 2385 soccer players aged 10–39 years. Higher-level soccer players showed greater (ES = 0.58 [95% CI 0.08-1.08], SE = 0.25, var = 0.06, z = 2.29, p = 0.022) VO2max performance with respect to their lower level counterparts. Furthermore, lower VO2max values in goalkeepers than defenders (ES = 1.31 (SE 0.46) [95% CI 0.41-2.21], var = 0.21, z = 2.84, p = 0.004) and midfielders (ES = 1.37 (SE 0.41) [95% CI 0.58 to 2.17], var = 0.16, z = 3.40, p = 0.001) were found. Thus, VO2max increased significantly with age (all, p < 0.01): Under 10 versus Under 11 years, Under 11 versus Under 12 years, Under 12 versus Under 13 years, Under 13 versus Under 14 years, Under 14 versus Under 15 years and Under 16-18 versus Under 20-23 years. VO2max performance is the most powerful discriminator between higher and lower-level soccer players. These findings indicate also the need for sports scientists and conditioning professionals to take the VO2max performance of soccer players into account when designing individualized position specific training programs.

However, measuring RMR in the field is difficult due to the equipment and strict protocols that need to be adhered to. Therefore, predictive equations have been created to estimate RMR as a baseline measurement for energy needs have been generated. However, the accuracy of these measures amongst elite female rugby players has not yet been assessed. The aim of the present study was to determine the accuracy of commonly used RMR prediction equations compared to the direct measurement of RMR amongst elite female rugby 7s players. Twenty one elite female rugby 7s players provided written informed consent to participate in the study. Participants drove to the clinic following an overnight fast, where RMR, height, weight and a DEXA scanmeasures were taken. Restingmetabolic rate was predicted (kcal/24 h) from a variety of equations; Haris-Benedict, = 655.96 + 1.850∗height (cm) + 9.563∗weight (kg) - 4.676∗age (y); Miffin St Jeor, = 10 x weight (kg) + 6.25 x height (cm) - 5 x age (y) - 161; Owen, = (795 + 7.18∗weight(kg)); Schofield, = (34∗weight (kg)+ 0.06∗height (cm)+ 3530)/4.184 and Cunningham, = 500 + 22∗FFM (kg). A one-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare differences among measured RMR and predicted RMR values. Follow up analysis included paired sample t-tests with Bonferroni adjustment (0.05/5 = 0.01). Data presented asmean ± standard deviation. Only the Cunningham equation predicted RMR (1704 ± 129 kcal/24h) that was not significantly different from measured RMR, 1744 ± 206 kcal/24h (p>0.999), with a mean difference of 39 kcal. The Schofield equation (1588± 121 kcal/24h) although statistically different to the measure RMR (p = 0.008) the mean difference was small (156 kcal) suggesting a possible alternative to the Cunningham equation accurate measures of body composition are unavailable. As previously reported in the literature all the prediction equations significantly underestimated RMR compared to measured values (range 39-401 kcal). In line with other athletic populations the Cunningham equation appears to be the most accurate for predicting resting metabolic rate in female 7s players.","2019","2020-05-20 00:31:08","2020-05-20 00:31:08","","5-6","","","29","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1123/ijsnem.2019-0057; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628159752","adult; conference abstract; female; human; rugby; controlled study; analysis of variance; follow up; prediction; height; informed consent; body composition; resting metabolic rate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Test-retest reliability (noise) and weekly variation (signal) data were collected from 42 professional Australian footballers from 1 club during a competition season. Perceptual wellness was measured via questionnaires completed before main training sessions (48, 72, and 96 h postmatch), with players providing a rating (1-5 Likert scale) regarding their muscle soreness, sleep quality, fatigue level, stress, and motivation. Eccentric hamstring force and countermovement jumps were assessed via proprietary systems once per week. Heart rate recovery was assessed via a standard submaximal run test on a grass-covered field with players wearing a heart rate monitor. The heart rate recovery was calculated by subtracting average heart rate during final 10 seconds of rest from average heart rate during final 30 seconds of exercise. Typical test error was reported as coefficient of variation percentage (CV%) and intraclass coefficients. Sensitivity was calculated by dividing weekly CV% by test CV% to produce a signal to noise ratio. RESULTS: All measures displayed acceptable sensitivity. Signal to noise ratio ranged from 1.3 to 11.1. Intraclass coefficients ranged from .30 to .97 for all measures. CONCLUSIONS: The heart rate recovery test, countermovement jump test, eccentric hamstring force test, and perceptual wellness all possess acceptable measurement sensitivity. Signal to noise ratio analysis is a novel method of assessing measurement characteristics of monitoring tools. These data can be used by coaches and scientists to identify meaningful changes in common measures of fitness and fatigue in professional Australian football.","2019","2020-05-20 00:31:09","2020-05-20 00:31:09","","1-7","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1123/ijspp.2019-0060; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629600033","football player; human; article; hamstring muscle; exercise; heart rate; controlled study; season; competition; questionnaire; fatigue; motivation; nonhuman; stress; Likert scale; test retest reliability; sleep quality; grass; signal noise ratio","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Measures of strength and jump performance can predict 30-m sprint time in Rugby Union players. J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2019-Performance and fitness monitoring in Rugby Union often include jumping, sprinting, and strength tests, but repeatability of and relationships between these measures are unclear. The level of interindividual variability in these relationships and their sprint time predictive capabilities are also unknown. This study examined the reliability of, and relationship between, countermovement (CMJJH), squat (SJJH), and rebound (RBJJH) jump heights, rebound jump contact time (RBJCT), estimated 1 repetition maximum back squat relative to body mass (SQBM), and reactive strength index (RSI) to 30-m sprint time of subelite, semiprofessional Rugby Union players. Measurement reliability was very good, with high average intraclass correlation coefficients (≥0.9) and low coefficient of variation (<10.1%). All variables were significantly (p < 0.01) correlated to each other (r > 0.575), except for SQBM (only related to CMJJH, r = 0.621) and RBJCT (only related to RSI, r = -0.727). SJJH and SQBM were the strongest and most consistent predictors of time to 30 m (R = 0.754 ± 0.081; SEE = 0.166 ± 0.025), but variability in SEE magnitude was observed across the group during bootstrapping. Cross-validation showed a mean difference between actual and predicted 30 m times equivalent to 0.22% of the group average time to 30 m. These results support the importance of multiple aspects of fitness training in Rugby Union players for improving performance in short-duration sprinting activities, but highlight the individual nature of their relative importance. Measures of strength and power can be used to predict short sprint performance by the strength and conditioning professional.","2019","2020-05-20 00:31:10","2020-05-20 00:31:10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1519/JSC.0000000000003170; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L627517816","human; article; rugby; exercise; height; reliability; correlation coefficient; contact time; validation process; rebound; bootstrapping","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since passes are the most frequently occurring on-the-ball actions on the pitch, a natural way to achieve this objective is by identifying players who are effective in setting up chances. Unfortunately, traditional statistics such as number of assists fail to reveal players excelling in this area. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces a novel metric that measures the players' involvement in setting up chances by valuing the effectiveness of their passes. Our proposed metric identifies Arsenal player Mesut Özil as the most impactful player in terms of passes during the 2017/2018 season and proposes Ajax player Frenkie de Jong as a suitable replacement for Andrés Iniesta at FC Barcelona.

These athletes consistently demonstrate higher rates of groin strains compared with other contact sports. Measuring the hip adductor/abductor ratio has the potential to expose at-risk players, reduce injury rates, and preserve groin health in players with chronic strains. Focused Clinical Question: What is the clinical utility of measuring the hip adductor/abductor ratio for preseason and in-season ice hockey and soccer players? Summary of Key Findings: Three studies, all of which were prospective cohort designs, were included. One study involved assessing preseason strength and flexibility as a risk factor for adductor strains in professional ice hockey players. Another study performed with the same professional hockey team used preseason hip adductor/abductor strength ratios to screen for those players who would benefit from a strengthening intervention aimed at reducing the incidence of adductor strains. The final study, which was performed in elite U17 soccer players, assessed the effectiveness of monthly in-season strength monitoring as a guide to trigger in-season interventions to decrease injury incidence. Clinical Bottom Line: Measuring the hip adductor/abductor strength ratio in hockey and soccer players can be a beneficial preseason and in-season tool to predict future groin strain risk and screen for athletes who might benefit from a strengthening intervention. Strength of Recommendation: Level 3 evidence exists to support monitoring the hip adductor/abductor strength ratio to assess and reduce the risk of adductor strains in ice hockey and soccer players.","2019","2020-05-20 00:31:13","2020-05-20 00:31:13","","1-6","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1123/jsr.2018-0250; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628267494","sports medicine; human; article; soccer player; hip; injury; incidence; prospective study; season; cohort analysis; risk assessment; monitoring; inguinal region; ice hockey; physiotherapy; risk factor; comparative effectiveness","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The ISVs evolve under different rates for three well known mechanical boundary conditions, which in themselves introduce three different rates making a total of nine scenarios, that we postulate are related to brain damage progression: (1) monotonic overloads, (2) cyclic fatigue which corresponds to repetitive impacts, and (3) creep which is correlated to damage accumulation over time. Different NFL player positions are described to capture the different types of damage progression. Skill position players, such as quarterbacks, are expected to exhibit a greater p-tau protein accumulation during low cycle fatigue (higher amplitude impacts with a lesser number), and linemen who exhibit a greater p-tau protein accumulation during high cycle fatigue (lower amplitude impacts with a greater number of impacts). This mechanics-based damage framework presents a foundation for developing a multiscale model for traumatic brain injury that combines mechanics with biology.","2019","2020-05-20 00:31:16","2020-05-20 00:31:16","","1873-1888","","9","47","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002376831; http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10439-019-02294-1","adult; football player; human; article; biomechanics; priority journal; fatigue; human tissue; middle aged; disease exacerbation; aged; conceptual framework; brain function; brain region; chronic traumatic encephalopathy; tau protein; tauopathy; protein function; bioaccumulation; disease model; histopathology; nucleotide repeat; protein content","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Video descriptions of inciting events are lacking. OBJECTIVE: Perform a standardised visual video analysis of a series of acute adductor longus injuries in football. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional. METHODS: Video footage was reviewed by players, and assessed independently by five sports medicine professionals. Inciting events were described and categorised using standardised scoring, including playing situation, player/opponent behaviour, movement and body positions. RESULTS: Videos of acute adductor longus injuries in 17 professional male football players were analysed. Most injuries occurred in non-contact situations (71%), following a quick reaction to a change in play (53%). Injury actions were: change of direction (35%), kicking (29%), reaching (24%) and jumping (12%). Change of direction and reaching injuries were categorised as closed chain movements (59%), characterised by hip extension and abduction with external rotation. Kicking and jumping injuries were categorised as open chain (41%), characterised by a change from hip extension to hip flexion, and hip abduction to adduction, with external rotation. CONCLUSION: Acute adductor longus injuries in football occur in a variety of situations. Player actions can be categorised into closed (change of direction and reaching) and open (kicking and jumping) chain movements involving triplanar hip motion. A rapid muscle activation during a rapid muscle lengthening appears to be the fundamental injury mechanism for acute adductor longus injuries.","2019","2020-05-20 00:31:18","2020-05-20 00:31:18","","158-164","","3","53","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bjsports-2018-099246; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L626044865","adult; human; male; soccer; sport injury; hip; thigh; prospective study; injuries; athlete; young adult; cross-sectional study; videorecording; skeletal muscle; joint characteristics and functions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Based on VR technology and computer graphics theory, a pre-event prediction method for estimating the background advertisement exposure parameters of sporting events was put forward. The pre and post measures of the thirty BAEP of televised football games were compared to verify the effectiveness of the prediction method. Results There was no significant difference between the pre- and post-measurement results for the same football game. The pre- and post-measurement results of the thirty BAEP of televised football games were tightly matched. Conclusions Using the prediction method can predict the BAEP of televised football games effectively and overcomes the shortcomings of current prediction methods that inhibits the effectiveness of the prediction of exposure parameters due to changes such as the type of the sporting events, the size of the sports venue, the layout of the background advertisements, and the placement of the television cameras, etc.","2019","2020-05-20 00:31:25","2020-05-20 00:31:25","","","","10","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0223662; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2003423144","article; football; controlled study; prediction; advertising; virtual reality; computer graphics; television","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper aims to investigate the experiences of James, Head of Foundation Phase within an English professional youth academy, during a period of organisational change. Data were collected through field notes, informal observations and meetings, formal academy team meetings, co-worker interviews and four semi-structured in-depth participant interviews, which were subjected to an iterative process of inductive and deductive analysis. Theorising regarding the influence of professional self-interests upon the actions and strategies of the social actors was utilised to make sense of James' narrative. The findings highlighted how James strategically managed his relationships with others to further his own professional self-interests. Finally, following the findings of this study, we propose that the ability to develop micro-political literacy and a repertoire of micro-political actions and strategies would benefit coaches working within professional football during such periods of instability and change.

During this time, many adolescents engage in sports, which provides them with numerous health benefits. However, as trends in sport specialization and participation in yearround sports have increased over the past decade, the number of pediatric overuse injuries, including bone stress injuries, have increased, accounting for approximately 46-54% of all sports injuries. Bone stress injuries can range from stress reactions to stress fractures. There is limited evidence reporting on the various locations of middle and lower body bone stress injuries and recovery times in the pediatric population. The purpose of this study was to describe various locations of middle and lower body bone stress injuries and to identify differences in time to recovery in the pediatric population. Methods: A retrospective review of subjects diagnosed with a lumbar spine or lower body bone stress injury presenting to a pediatric sports medicine clinic over a two-year period was performed. Subjects were included if they were between the ages of 7-18 years old, presented to clinic within three years from symptom onset, and their diagnosis was confirmed via X-ray or MRI. Subjects were categorized into groups by location of their bone stress injury (femur, fibula, foot, lumbar spine, tibia, and tibia/fibula). Medical records were reviewed for demographics, injury characteristics, sport, imaging, treatment, and outcomes when available. Bone stress injury locations were compared using a Kruskal-Wallis test for continuous variables and a chi-square test for categorical variables. When the sample was small, a Fisher's exact test was used. Results: Of 134 eligible subjects, 84 (62.7%) were female and 50 (37.3%) were male with a mean age of 14.37 years (range=7-18) and mean BMI of 21.93 kg/m∧2. 127 (94.8%) subjects participated in sports, including gymnastics (15.2%), football (11.6%), running/cross-country (11.6%), and soccer (10.9%). The most common location of bone stress injury was lumbar spine (n=71, 53.0%), followed by foot (n=27, 20.2%) and tibia (n=16, 11.9%). 117 (87.3%) subjects were diagnosed via radiographs and 88 (65.7%) required further imaging via MRI to confirm diagnosis. CT was obtained in only 4 (3%) subjects. No significant differences in gender, sport, level of competition, imaging type, or treatment type were noted between bone stress injury groups. While various treatment modalities were implemented, physical therapy was prescribed in 99 (73.9%) subjects and bracing was prescribed in 38 (28.4%). 32 (23.9%) subjects were taking supplements prior to treatment or were prescribed them for their bone stress injury, which included vitamin D and calcium. 62 (46.3%) subjects were taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs prior to treatment or were prescribed them by the physician for their bone stress injury. Across all bone stress injury groups, the mean time from symptom onset to initial presentation was 80.76 days. The lumbar spine group had the longest time to presentation (103.99 days), followed by tibia (81.13 days) and femur (80.73 days, p=0.047) (Figure 1A). Follow-up information was available on 116 (86.6%) subjects. Mean time from diagnosis to recovery across all groups was 88.26 days. Bone stress injuries of the tibia had the longest recovery time (127.27 days), followed by lumbar spine (92.23 days) and femur (89 days, p=0.018) (Figure 1B). Conclusion/Significance: The lumbar spine was the most common location for middle and lower body bone stress injuries in this pediatric population, followed by foot and tibia. Tibia bone stress injuries took the longest time to heal.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate several methodological opportunities, to enhance the accuracy of this type of modelling. Specifically, we evaluated the potential benefits of 1) modelling match outcome using an increased number of seasons and PIs compared with previous reports, 2) how to identify eras where technical performance characteristics were stable and 3) the application of a novel feature selection method. Ninety-one PIs across sixteen Australian Football (AF) League seasons were analysed. Change-point and Segmented Regression analyses were used to identify eras and they produced similar but non-identical outcomes. A feature selection ensemble method identified the most valuable 45 PIs for modelling. The use of a larger number of seasons for model development lead to improvement in the classification accuracy of the models, compared with previous studies (88.8 vs 78.9%). This study demonstrates the potential benefits of large databases when creating models of match outcome and the pitfalls of determining whether there are eras in a longitudinal database.

The athlete recalls jumping for a pass against another player, when he was kicked in the knee and fell to the ground. He landed forcefully on a fully flexed knee, at which time he both heard and felt a pop in the knee. There was immediate pain and swelling and he was unable to continue playing due to the pain. He was subsequently placed in a knee immobilizer by the team athletic trainer and proceeded to take NSAIDs and ice the area daily until his clinic presentation. A few days after the injury, the athlete's mother noted that he was still unable to walk without difficulty and had become unable to raise his leg without assistance, prompting their request for an evaluation. No previous injuries to the affected knee. Athlete was not taking any medications prior to the injury. Physical Exam: Large effusion with passive range of motion of 5 to 90 degrees. Significant tenderness to palpation throughout the knee, most notably over the distal patella and area of the patellar tendon insertion, unable to distinguish any joint line tenderness or palpable defect. Negative Lachman, negative anterior or posterior drawer, negative pivot shift. No laxity with valgus or varus stressing at 0 and 30 degrees. Patient was unable to tolerate McMurray's testing due to pain. Unable to perform straight leg raise. Differential Diagnosis: Patellar tendon rupture Quadriceps tendon rupture Patellar fracture Anterior Cruciate Ligament tear Tibial tubercle avulsion Test Results: XR: High riding patella, Insall Salvati ratio = 1.8, no evidence of distinct fracture or bony abnormality. MRI: (1) Findings consistent with proximal patellar tendon avulsion. Large amount of surrounding soft tissue swelling. Upward migration of the patella. (2) Findings consistent with nondisplaced subcortical fracture of the lateral femoral condyle. Large contusion and microfracture of the lateral tibial plateau. (3) Negative for meniscal, cruciate ligament or collateral ligament disruption. Final Diagnosis: (1) Proximal Patellar Tendon avulsion. (2) Subcortical fracture of the lateral femoral condyle. Discussion: Patellar tendon tears commonly occur under 40 years of age, with forced hyperflexion of the lower leg. Although unable to palpate an infrapatellar gap, the athlete had the other hallmark signs, including acute onset pain and swelling, loss of active knee extension and xray evidence of patella alta. In pediatrics, there is higher tendency for distal avulsion of the patellar tendon from the proximal tibia. In this rare case, the athlete suffered a complete avulsion of the proximal tendon off of the distal patella. There was no previous increased risk of tendon rupture, including osteo-chondral disorders, use of systemic steroids or quinolones. Outcome: At 5 weeks post-op repair of the patellar tendon, the patient is progressing well. All incisions have healed, without evidence of tissue breakdown. He has advanced to a passive range of motion of 0 to 30 degrees with useof a CPM machine and is able to perform an active straight leg raise without assistance. Follow-up: He is expected to make a full recovery, with return to play in 4 to 6 months and plans to return to competition next season.","2019","2020-05-20 00:31:40","2020-05-20 00:31:40","","e32-e33","","2","29","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/JSM.0000000000000728; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629860402","conference abstract; female; football player; human; male; sport injury; case report; clinical article; season; competition; adolescent; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; follow up; patellar ligament; outcome assessment; range of motion; jumping; pain; remission; soft tissue; recall; differential diagnosis; incision; contusion; microfracture; femoral condyle; athletic trainer; palpation; avulsion injury; steroid; swelling; lower leg; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; collateral ligament; continuous passive motion machine; knee immobilizer; lateral tibial plateau; patella fracture; pediatrics; quadriceps tendon rupture; quinolone derivative","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper focuses on youth soccer coaches and their reflections on coach education programs. In the background section the Swedish context is described, as well as current research on coaches' education and learning. The aim of the paper was to investigate youth soccer coaches' reflections on coach education programs and to analyse their reflections by using a cultural approach to learning. The empirical material of the paper derives from a web-based questionnaire, posing questions about competence, learning and stress. The coaches were also invited to reflect on the question ""how do you believe that soccer associations can educate good coaches?"" There were 369 responses, and these were analysed using qualitative content analysis. Results indicated reflections about Flexibility in time, place and content, Mentorship supporting informal learning, Demanding mandatory education and emolument, Education focusing on wholeness and Education being based in practice. The conclusion was that decentralization of education and development of coaches' contexts, abilities and motivation to critically analyse aims and contents of coach education programs are improvement areas for learning and coaching practices.

Methods: One hundred and thirty nine male subjects (soccer, floorball, non-athletes) were measured for proportion of muscle mass between upper extremities (BADΔ) and lower extremities (BLDΔ). Moreover, the peak muscle torque of knee extensors (PTE) and flexors (PTF), ipsilateral (H:Q) and bilateral strength ratio (Q:Q, H:H) were measured. Results: We found significant differences in observed parameters with respect to different sport activities (F = 13.02, p = 0.00, ηρ2 = 0.80). Higher values of BADΔ were observed in the non-active (0.19 ± 0.11 kg) group compared with soccer players (0.10 ± 0.11 kg). We found a lower value of BLDΔ in floorball players (0.32 ± 0.11 kg) compared with soccer players (0.58 ± 0.27 kg) and non-active boys (0.63 ± 0.28 kg). Results revealed significantly higher PTE in soccer players compared with non-active boys and floorball players and higher Q:Q ratio in soccer players (10.99 ± 7.75%) compared with non-active boys (7.47 ± 5.92%). Conclusions: This study revealed that there are morphological and strength asymmetries in the observed groups, which may have potential maladaptive effects (e.g. uncompensated overload of extremity) in athletes affected by specific load.","2019","2020-05-20 00:31:50","2020-05-20 00:31:50","","207-216","","1","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/med-2019-0014; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L626753647","human; human experiment; male; article; soccer player; upper limb; knee; controlled study; major clinical study; child; muscle mass; torque; body composition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the study, 12 variables were used to evaluate the morphological characteristics defined as predictor (input) set of variables. Criterion variables presented the following agility assessment tests: agilityforward- backward run with rotation (93639OK), 20- yard test (MAG 20Y), 4x5 meters run (AG4X5M), T-test (MAG T). For the determination of the predictive values of the selected morphological characteristics on the successful result in the agility assessment tests, four multiple regression analyses were applied to each test. The results of regression analysis show that the morphological characteristics observed in this study are relatively poorly correlated with the results in the cadet's agility evaluation. Statistically significant regression correlation was obtained between selected morphological characteristics and the 4 x 5 meters run with a change of direction at 90° and 180° (AG4X5M). There was no statistically significant correlation in the other agility test estimation and the selected morphological characteristics although the partial association of some morphological characteristics was noticed. The results obtained may be of benefit to coaches and other professionals working with younger age categories in football as guidance for more useful planning and programming of training work, as well in the choice of appropriate training methods.

However, comparisons with general populations can introduce bias. This study compared mortality between US National Football League (NFL) and US Major League Baseball (MLB) players, a more appropriate comparison group of professional athletes. OBJECTIVE To compare all-cause and cause-specific mortality between NFL and MLB players. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this retrospective cohort study, the setting was US mortality from January 1, 1979, through December 31, 2013. The dates of analysis were January 2016 to April 2019. Participants were 3419 NFL and 2708 MLB players with at least 5 playing seasons. EXPOSURES Participation in the NFL compared with the MLB. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Vital status and causes of death from the National Death Index from 1979 through 2013 were obtained. Cox proportional hazards regression models using age as the timescalewere used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95%CIs to examine all-cause and causespecific mortality among NFL players compared with MLB players, adjusted for race and decade of birth. RESULTS By the end of follow-up, there were 517 deaths (mean [SD] age, 59.6 [13.2] years) in the NFL cohort and 431 deaths (mean [SD] age, 66.7 [12.3] years) in the MLB cohort. Cardiovascular and neurodegenerative conditions, respectively,were noted as underlying or contributing causes in 498 and 39 deaths in the NFL and 225 and 16 deaths in the MLB. Compared with MLB players, NFL players had significantly elevated rates of all-cause (HR, 1.26; 95%CI, 1.10-1.44), cardiovascular disease (HR, 2.40; 95%CI, 2.03-2.84), and neurodegenerative disease (HR, 2.99; 95%CI, 1.64-5.45) mortality. Comparing hypothetical populations of 1000 NFL and 1000 MLB players followed up to age 75 years, there would be an excess 21 all-cause deaths among NFL players, as well as 77 and 11 more deaths with underlying or contributing causes that included cardiovascular and neurodegenerative conditions, respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study found that NFL players had elevated all-cause, cardiovascular, and neurodegenerative mortality rates compared with MLB players, although the absolute number of excess neurodegenerative deaths was still small. Factors that vary across these sports (eg, body habitus and head trauma) as opposed to those common across sports (eg, physical activity) could underlie the differences.","2019","2020-05-20 00:31:53","2020-05-20 00:31:53","","","","5","2","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2019.4223; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629190657","adult; football player; human; male; article; priority journal; controlled study; major clinical study; cohort analysis; young adult; follow up; retrospective study; professional athlete; cardiovascular disease; comparative study; degenerative disease; Alzheimer disease; mortality; proportional hazards model; mortality rate; all cause mortality; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; baseball player; cause specific survival; Parkinson disease; suicide","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While nine football programs have initiated the transition to the FBS since 2012, the football program at Western Kentucky University (WKU) was the only program from 2005 to 2011 to reclassify from the FCS to the FBS, providing a unique opportunity for a case study. Spending and revenue trends continue to fluctuate in athletic programs and in higher education at large. It is important to recognize the repercussions financially and otherwise of football reclassification and consider if elevating to FBS is a fiscally responsible decision for universities. Several financial decisions, including a stadium renovation, facilities expansion, aggressive coaching moves, conference realignment, and upgrading the nonconference schedule, demonstrated that WKU's football program was an early adopter of the current reclassification trend in college athletics. By studying the case of WKU's football transition to the FBS, we can explain the longitudinal impact of such a commitment and make connections to current trends in college football.

However, the understanding of this relationship in football players is limited. The aim of this study was to compare the prevalence of intra-articular hip findings in male and female semi-elite football players with and without HRP. Methods: 185 semi-elite football players (288 HRP hips; 50 % soccer/50 % Australian rules football (ARF); age 26 yrs; height 1.79 m; weight 78 kg; 20 % women) with HRP ( > 6/12 pain and + ve FADIR) and 55 control semi-elite football players (110 hips; 55 % soccer/45 % ARF; age 26 yrs; height 1.79 m; weight 79 kg; 26 % women) without HRP (no pain and -ve FADIR) were evaluated with MRI. For each hip, the Scoring Hip Osteoarthritis with MRI (SHOMRI) method was used to quantify the presence and severity of intra-articular hip findings. Between group differences for patient characteristics were evaluated with parametric and non-parametric tests. Linear and logistic regression with generalised estimating equations were used in per hip analyses to estimate differences between HRP and control hips. Results: Patient characteristics did not differ between groups (p = 0.32–0.78). HRP hips had a higher SHOMRI score than controls in men (2.0, 95 %CI 0.7,2.6, p = 0.001) but not women (0.0, 95 %CI–0.9,1.7, p = 0.57). There was no difference in the proportion of hips with cartilage defects in men (56 % vs 48 %, OR = 1.4, 95 %CI 0.8–2.5) or women (30 % vs 46 %, OR = 0.5, 95 %CI 0.2–1.5), bone marrow edema (BME) in men (7 % vs 2 %, OR = 3.1, 95 %CI 0.60.15.6) or women (3 % vs 4 %, OR = 0.89 95 %CI 0.06,13.1), subchondral cysts in men only (11 % vs 10 %, OR = 1.1 95 %CI 0.5,2.6), labral tears in men (73 % vs 63 %, OR = 1.6, 95 %CI 0.9–2.9) or women (68 % vs 75 %, OR = 0.7, 95 %CI 0.2–2.2), paralabral cysts in men (27 % vs 21 %, OR = 1.4, 95 %CI 0.7–2.8) or women (19 % vs 14 %, OR = 1.4, 95 %CI 0.4–5.6) or ligamentum teres tears in men only (4 % vs 5 %, OR = 0.80, 95 %CI 0.16,4.0) between HRP and control hips. Conclusions: Intra-articular hip findings found on MRI are seen frequently in football players independent of HRP. The proportion of hips with a cartilage defect, BME, subchondral cyst, labral tear or paralabral cyst was not greater in football players with HRP than without. Interventions focused solely on imaging-defined intra-articular hip findings as a cause of HRP may be premature in football players.","2019","2020-05-20 00:32:01","2020-05-20 00:32:01","","S61-S62","","","22","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsams.2019.08.261; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002914876","adult; conference abstract; female; football player; human; male; soccer; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; clinical article; controlled study; prevalence; pain; endogenous compound; quantitative analysis; nonparametric test; hip osteoarthritis; bone defect; cartilage; adenosine diphosphate ribosylation factor; bone marrow edema; cyst; round ligament","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Much 'more than a club', Barça is a platform for the expansion of a Catalan national consciousness. At a time when Catalonia is at a critical point in its relations with the Spanish state, claiming the right to national self-determination and presenting the possibility of secession, this paper examines how Barça boosts the strength of Catalan nationalist feelings through dynamics characteristic of the football sphere, such as rituals of group belonging, fandom performances of loyalty, the dramatization of rivalries, the elevation of those achieving sporting success to national icons or the strength of feeling provided by the sports ground. Looking at the period 2003-2014, it concludes that Barça is key in advancing claims that Catalonia is a sovereign nation with the right to decide its political future.

Measures of rapid automatic naming (RAN) have been used for over 50 years to capture aspects of vision and cognition. MULES was designed as a series of 54 grouped color photographs (fruits, random objects, animals) that integrates saccades, color perception and contextual object identification. We examined MULES performance in youth, collegiate and professional athletes at pre-season baseline and at the sidelines following concussion. Methods: Our study teams administered the MULES to youth, collegiate and professional athletes during pre-season baseline testing. Sideline post-concussion time scores were compared to pre-season baseline scores among athletes with concussion to determine degrees and directions of change. Results: Among 681 athletes (age 17 ± 4 years, range 6–37, 38% female), average test times at baseline were 41.2 ± 11.2 s. The group included 280 youth, 357 collegiate and 44 professional athletes; the most common sports were ice hockey (23%), soccer (17%) and football (11%). Age was a predictor of MULES test times, with longer times noted for younger participants (P < .001, linear regression). Consistent with other timed performance measures, significant learning effects were noted for the MULES during baseline testing with trial 1 test times (mean 49.2 ± 13.1 s) exceeding those for trial 2 (mean 41.3 ± 11.2 s, P < .0001, paired t-test). Among 17 athletes with concussion during the sports seasons captured to date (age 18 ± 3 years), all showed increases (worsening) of MULES time scores from pre-season baseline (median increase 11.2 s, range 0.6–164.2, P = .0003, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). The Symptom Severity Score from the SCAT5 Symptom Evaluation likewise worsened from pre-season baseline following injury among participants with concussion (P = .002). Conclusions: Concussed athletes demonstrate worsening performance on the MULES test compared to their baseline time scores. This test samples a wide network of brain pathways and complements other vision-based measures for sideline concussion assessment. The MULES test demonstrates capacity to identify athletes with sports-related concussion.","2019","2020-05-20 00:32:04","2020-05-20 00:32:04","","52-56","","","402","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jns.2019.04.036; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2001968646","adult; female; human; male; article; football; soccer; brain concussion; priority journal; controlled study; sport; adolescent; athlete; disease severity; cognition; learning; child; ice hockey; clinical assessment; vision; comparative study; cognitive function test; photography; clinical assessment tool; color vision; mobile universal lexicon evaluation system; symptom assessment; Symptom Severity Score; time to treatment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Twenty-eight young male soccer players were randomly assigned to an experimental group (EG, n = 14; age: 11.8 ± 0.4 years) and a control group (CG, n = 14; age: 11.6 ± 0.5 years). The EG introduced 8-week MPT, two days per week into their in-season training, while CG continued training without change. Measurements of vertical jump height, CODP, and DPC were completed at the beginning and end of the 8-week MPT. A significant group × time interaction was observed for Squat-Jump (p < 0.05), for Counter-Movement Jump (p < 0.05), and for CODP test (p < 0.05). In addition, a significant group × time interaction was observed for DPC in seven axes for the dominant- (anterior, lateral, postero-lateral, posterior, postero-medial, medial, and antero-medial; p < 0.05 for all) and in seven axes for the non-dominant- (anterior, antero-lateral, lateral, posterior, postero-medial, medial and antero-medial; p < 0.05 for all) legs. The rest of the axes of both legs did not show any significant group × time interaction (p > 0.05). In conclusion, incorporating MPT into the in-season regimen of young male soccer players improved performance of various indices related to soccer activity (i.e., vertical jump height, CODP, and DPC). MPT has the potential to be appealing to coaches, as it requires little time while yielding valuable results in the physical preparation of young soccer players.","2019","2020-05-20 00:32:07","2020-05-20 00:32:07","","","","","10","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2019.01462; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L630296773","human; male; article; soccer player; clinical article; controlled study; season; performance; randomized controlled trial; leg; child; school child; muscle strength; agility; plyometrics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Further, previous research has mostly been confined to association-based linear approaches and post-game prediction, with limited assessment of predictive machine learning (ML) models in a pre-game setting. Therefore, our aim was to use ML techniques to predict game outcomes and produce a hierarchy of important (win/loss) variables. A total of 152 variables (79 absolute and 73 differentials) were used from the 2013–2018 Australian Football League (AFL) seasons. Various ML models were trained (cross-validation) on the 2013–2017 seasons with the–2018 season used as an independent test set. Model performance varied (66.5-73.3% test set accuracy), although the best model (glmnet – 73.3%) rivalled bookmaker predictions in the same period (70.9%). The glmnet model revealed measures of team quality (a player-based rating and a team-based) in their relative form as the most important variables for prediction. Models that contained in-built feature selection or could model non-linear relationships generally performed better. These findings show that AFL game outcomes can be predicted using ML methods and provide a hierarchy of predictors that maximize the chance of winning.

In addition to identifying similarities and differences between CSR practices in the two countries, our analysis extends and adapts the implicit-explicit CSR framework to the field of sport. Research methods: We used a mixed methods approach to analyse qualitative and quantitative data on the CSR strategies of 66 professional rugby union (Top 14, Aviva Premiership Rugby) and football (Ligue 1, Premier League) clubs that participated in the 2017-2018 season. Results and findings: We found major differences in CSR communication between France and the UK. Communication by French clubs tends to highlight sport's values, involve few media channels, whereas communication by UK clubs explicitly vaunts their social responsibility and involves numerous channels. In the case of CSR implementation, there are similarities between French and UK clubs, especially in the fields their CSR initiatives cover (e.g. health, diversity), as well as differences. However, the scope of initiatives varies more between sports than between countries, with football demonstrating a more international outlook than rugby. Implications: This article expands Matten and Moon's [(2008). 'Implicit' and 'explicit' CSR: A conceptual framework for a comparative understanding of corporate social responsibility. Academy of Management Review, 33(2), 404-424] implicit-explicit CSR framework by identifying the influence of interactions between sectorial/field-level factors and national/macro-level factors on CSR practices, and by distinguishing between CSR communication and CSR implementation.

This is further complicated by concomitant structural disease. Case: A 73 year old man with a history of HOCM and moderate coronary disease had an episode of chest discomfort with diaphoresis at an emotionally intense football game. Presenting ECG showed sinus rhythm with an old left bundle branch block. Troponin T was 0.322ng/ml and Hemoglobin 18.5g/dL. Patient was hypotensive with pulmonary edema. Emergent coronary angiography showed stable moderate disease in the left circumflex. Echocardiography showed a newly depressed ejection fraction with a large area of apical akinesia and severe systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve with severe regurgitation and a left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradient of 73mmHg. Right to left shunt with agitated saline injection was noted after 5 cardiac cycles. Decision-making: On initial evaluation, the patient was hypotensive and hypoxemic. Management in this setting required delicate titration of beta blockers and vasopressors. Ultimately, with appropriate heart rate control and volume management, the patient's blood pressure normalized with reduction in LVOT obstruction. Despite hemodynamic improvement, he remained hypoxic. Review of chest imaging showed a pulmonary arteriovenous malformation (AVM) with a 5mm feeding branch artery. In conjunction with polycythemia, persistent hypoxemia and the noted echo findings, the AVM was considered to be clinically significant. Oxygen requirement resolved after AVM coiling. Interpretation of the clinical scenario was a stress induced cardiomyopathy which worsened LVOT obstruction in the setting of HOCM. This in turn raised pulmonary pressures which augmented shunt across the AVM. Conclusion: On follow up, the patient reported improved exercise tolerance compared to baseline. Echo showed normalization of function with no evidence of residual shunting. Multiple mechanisms of shock and hypoxemia presented a diagnostic challenge with delicate management strategies. Understanding the complex physiology and appropriate imaging was critical in management.","2019","2020-05-20 00:32:11","2020-05-20 00:32:11","","2191","","9 Supplement 1","73","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2001643652; http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0735-1097(19)32797-4","conference abstract; human; male; football; case report; clinical article; follow up; physiology; motion; decision making; hemoglobin; coronary angiography; echocardiography; endogenous compound; aged; antihypertensive agent; clinical evaluation; diagnosis; heart ejection fraction; thorax pain; blood pressure monitoring; exercise tolerance; sinus rhythm; oxygen; troponin T; hypoxemia; lung edema; sodium chloride; lung pressure; akinesia; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; cardiogenic shock; diaphoresis; feeding; heart cycle; heart left bundle branch block; heart left ventricle outflow tract obstruction; heart right left shunt; hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy; injection; mitral valve; polycythemia; pulmonary arteriovenous fistula; takotsubo cardiomyopathy; titrimetry","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of men who had played in the NFL after 1960. Participants were studied using a standardized self-administered questionnaire designed to determine both the exposure history to ASF and the prevalence of chronic pain, sleep apnea, cardiometabolic disease, and neurocognitive impairment. Logistic regression and negative binomial regression models were used to assess associations between age, ethnicity, body-mass index during professional football career, field position, and football career duration with individual and multiple afflictions. RESULTS: In this cohort of former NFL players (n = 3745), approximately one quarter of the eligible former players (27%) reported two or more medical afflictions (chronic pain, cardiometabolic disease, sleep apnea, or neurocognitive impairment). Career duration was significantly associated with an increase in the number of comorbidities. Age, race, and body-mass index were associated with all affliction categories, other than neurocognitive impairment, which was similarly prevalent in middle-aged players and older players. Earlier age when first playing the sport was protective against cardiometabolic affliction. CONCLUSIONS: Former NFL players report significant combinations of cross-system afflictions. Future work will be required to determine mechanistic underpinnings. However, attention to the whole player, rather than specific organ systems seems critical to improve long-term health outcomes in former ASF professional athletes.","2019","2020-05-20 00:32:13","2020-05-20 00:32:13","","655-662","","8","62","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ajim.22992; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628053276","adult; human; male; article; football; controlled study; major clinical study; athlete; body mass; cohort analysis; ethnicity; race; questionnaire; retrospective study; attention; prevalence; career; middle aged; comorbidity; aging; sleep disordered breathing; chronic pain; organ systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Eleven national-team players were analyzed in this study. A lactate threshold test was performed during the first 3 d, whereas fingertip blood was drawn most mornings (21 out of 30 d) for [CK] measurements. One-way repeated-measures analysis of variance was used for determining the effect of time on [CK] measurements, whereas Pearson correlation coefficient was used for assessing associations between the changes in [CK] and velocities associated with blood lactate concentrations of 2 (v2) and 4 mmol·L-1 (v4). RESULTS: Peak [CK] concentrations were consistently reached on the first day after the match with values of 474 (261), 520 (419), and 460 (126) U·L-1 but with no significant differences between them. [CK] concentrations returned to prematch values (331 [201] U·L-1) on the second day after the match. The change in [CK] concentration between prematch and postmatch day was largely correlated (r = .614, P = .044) with v2. CONCLUSIONS: Top-level soccer players display low levels of muscle damage during official tournaments, and they recover before the next match. Postmatch muscle damage is greater in players with higher aerobic endurance because this fitness quality enables them to execute high-intensity activities known to be a major contributor to muscle damage.","2019","2020-05-20 00:32:15","2020-05-20 00:32:15","","1-7","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1123/ijspp.2019-0084; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629523970","human; article; soccer player; controlled study; team sport; competition; analysis of variance; velocity; endurance; creatine kinase; muscle injury; human tissue; correlation coefficient; lactate blood level","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: After a 24-h CHO-loading protocol of 8 and 2 g/kg in the prematch meal, 2 elite male forward players had biopsies sampled from m. vastus lateralis before and after participation in a South Australian Football League game. Player A (87.2 kg) consumed water only during match play, whereas player B (87.6 kg) consumed 88 g CHO via CHO gels. External load was quantified using global positioning system technology. Results: Player A completed more minutes on the ground (115 vs 98 min) and covered greater total distance (12.2 vs 11.2 km) than player B, although with similar high-speed running (837 vs 1070 m) and sprinting (135 vs 138 m). Muscle glycogen decreased by 66% in player A (pre: 656 mmol/kg dry weight [dw], post: 223 mmol/kg dw) and 24% in player B (pre: 544 mmol/kg dw, post: 416 mmol/kg dw). Conclusion: Prematch CHO loading elevated muscle glycogen concentrations (ie, >500 mmol/kg dw), the magnitude of which appears sufficient to meet the metabolic demands of elite AF match play. The glycogen cost of AF match play may be greater than in soccer and rugby, and CHO feeding may also spare muscle glycogen use. Further studies using larger sample sizes are now required to quantify the interindividual variability of glycogen cost of match play (including muscle and fiber-type-specific responses), as well examining potential metabolic and ergogenic effects of CHO feeding.

The muscle pre-activity that occur during jump landing are considered to be an important predictor of non-contact anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury risk. ACL injury prevention programs have been widely conducted; these programs are generally focused on increasing the muscle pre-activity and include rotational jump landing. The purpose of this study was to investigate the timing of the muscle pre-activity of the hamstrings and quadriceps during 180° and 360° rotational jump landing. Methods: The participants were 10 healthy females. Electromyography was conducted on the knee joint muscles of the left leg (the non-dominant leg) during clockwise 180° and 360° rotational jump landings. Results: The muscle pre-activities during 180° rotational jump landing was VM: 35.68 ± 11.22 msec, RF: 38.05 ± 14.77 msec, VL: 47.10 ± 19.96 msec, BF: 115.63 ± 30.48 msec and SM: 136.45 ± 47.52 msec.

Musculoskeletal modelling can help analyse the relationship between motion, external forces and internal loads that lead to injury. However, impact specific musculoskeletal models are lacking as current viscoelastic values used to describe cervical spine joint dynamics have been obtained from unrepresentative quasi-static or static experiments. The aim of this study was to develop and validate a cervical spine musculoskeletal model for use in axial impacts. Cervical spine specimens (C2-C6) were tested under measured sub-catastrophic loads and the resulting 3D motion of the vertebrae was measured. Specimen specific musculoskeletal models were then created and used to estimate the axial and shear viscoelastic (stiffness and damping) properties of the joints through an optimisation algorithm that minimised tracking errors between measured and simulated kinematics. A five-fold cross validation and a Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis were conducted to assess the performance of the newly estimated parameters. The impact-specific parameters were integrated in a population specific musculoskeletal model and used to assess cervical spine loads measured from Rugby union impacts compared to available models. Results of the optimisation showed a larger increase of axial joint stiffness compared to axial damping and shear viscoelastic parameters for all models. The sensitivity analysis revealed that lower values of axial stiffness and shear damping reduced the models performance considerably compared to other degrees of freedom. The impact-specific parameters integrated in the population specific model estimated more appropriate joint displacements for axial head impacts compared to available models and are therefore more suited for injury mechanism analysis.","2019","2020-05-20 00:32:20","2020-05-20 00:32:20","","","","5","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0216663; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2001964253","article; controlled study; cervical spine; kinematics; nonhuman; musculoskeletal disease assessment; process optimization; joint characteristics and functions; musculoskeletal system parameters; genetic algorithm; animal tissue; in vitro study; Monte Carlo method; proof of concept; shear damping; shear stiffness; viscoelasticity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The 2018 AFLW Injury Report detailed differences in injury incidence between elite male and female players. A particularly alarming statistic was that elite female Australian Football players have a 9.2 times increased risk of ACL injuries compared to their male counterparts (6.47 ACL injuries per 1000 player hours in the 2018 AFLW season compared with 0.70 per 1000 player hours in the 2017 AFL men's competition). The aim of this study was to report physical characteristics relating to lower limb strength, endurance, range of motion, balance, and pain during adductor squeeze in elite female Australian Football players. Secondary aims were to examine the effect of limb dominance, previous Australian Football experience, and previous level of sports participation on these characteristics. Methods: Eighty-five elite female football players from three AFLW clubs who were aged 18 years or older, contracted for the 2018 season, and participating in pre-season training were included. Demographic data were collected including limb dominance, previous football experience, and the highest level of previous sports participation. The physical characteristic assessments included; the adductor squeeze test, weight-bearing lunge, side bridge, isometric hip abduction and adduction strength, and the star excursion balance test. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the physical characteristics and linear mixed models examined the effect of demographics on the data. Results: The results for the dominant side were (mean ± SD): 10.8 ± 2.5 cm for the weight-bearing lunge, 96 ± 41s for the side bridge, 1.88 ± 0.22 and 1.86 ± 0.38 Nm/kg for hip abduction and adduction strength respectively, and 92 ± 8 % for the star excursion balance test. The adductor squeeze had relatively low pain scores, with 93 % of players scoring ≤ 2. There was no effect of limb dominance, previous Australian Football experience, or previous level of sports on the data. Discussion: This study reports the physical characteristics for five assessments of elite females participating in the 2018 AFLW season. These data can be used to help understand the profile of this new and evolving sporting cohort. The data can also be used as a comparator in the screening, prevention and management of injuries in elite female Australian Football players. Conflict of interest statement: There are no conflicts of interest related to this abstract.","2019","2020-05-20 00:32:22","2020-05-20 00:32:22","","S65","","","22","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsams.2019.08.268; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002914871","adult; conference abstract; female; football player; human; male; hip; clinical article; controlled study; season; competition; young adult; endurance; abduction; adduction; range of motion; anterior cruciate ligament injury; pain; demography; conflict of interest; weight bearing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

CMR has the unique ability to diagnose non-invasively these three common entities. Here we present the case of a 20 year-old semi-profesional soccer player with no prior medical history who was admitted to the emergency room at another institution for prolonged angina followed by a syncopal episode after a soccer game preceded by dizziness. The patient reported similar episodes of typical chest pain on exertion that began 2 years ago. ECG showed normal sinus rhythm, with intermittent episodes of sinus bradycardia, and pathologic Q waves in the inferior wall leads. A trans-thoracic echocardiogram showed mild hypokinesis in the inferior wall in addition to increased end-diastolic thickness up to 15 mm suggestive of HCM. He was then referred to our institution for further management and possible need for ICD. During admission, physical examination was unremarkable. Due to the atypical findings for the patient's age, a Cardiac MRI was performed which demonstrated left ventricular end-diastolic thickness of 14 mm with no left ventricular outflow obstruction; it was also noticeable significant hypertrophy of the skeletal muscle. In addition, it showed no regional wall motion abnormalities. However there was an subendocardial infarction during LGE sequence in the inferior wall in addition to an anomalous origin of the right coronary artery (RCA), arising from the left coronary cusp with an interarterial course (between the pulmonary artery and the ascending aorta) with slit-like morphology (Fig.1). Symptoms were attributed to the RCA anomalous origin and the hypertrophy was attribute to his high-intensity physical activity. He underwent modified un-roofing surgical correction, performed using a median sternotomy. The patient had an unremarkable postoperative course and was discharged home four days after surgery and has remained asymptomatic since surgery resuming his physical training without recurrence of chest pain or syncope.","2019","2020-05-20 00:32:24","2020-05-20 00:32:24","","ii43","","","20","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ehjci/jez110.003; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L630692107","adult; conference abstract; human; male; soccer player; case report; clinical article; exercise; physical activity; young adult; motion; ascending aorta; physical examination; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; echocardiography; dizziness; medical history; thickness; emergency ward; muscle hypertrophy; faintness; thorax pain; sinus rhythm; hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; sinus bradycardia; heart infarction; heart left ventricle outflow tract obstruction; angina pectoris; hypokinesia; pulmonary artery; Q wave; right coronary artery; sternotomy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We report a case of a college football player who presented with ischemic chest pain after taking clenbuterol. Case: A healthy 22-year-old male presented with moderate intermittent retrosternal chest pressure radiating to his jaw and left arm associated with palpitations and diaphoresis. He denied any alcohol or recreational drug use but admitted to recently completing a 2-week course of clenbuterol aimed at enhancing his weight lifting exercise regimen. Family history was negative for premature CAD. Physical examination was benign and vitals were stable. Initial Troponin level was 3.5 ng/ml. The rest of the laboratory data was normal including a lipid profile and urine drug screen. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm. He was started on aspirin, heparin drip and metoprolol and was planned to have a left heart catheterization the next day. His chest pain recurred a few hours later at rest with worsening intensity. Repeat EKG showed 1mm ST segment elevation in V3 and V4 consistent with early repolarization. Troponin peaked at 5.4 ng/ml. Decision-making: The recurrence of chest pain, peak troponin level as well as new EKG changes prompted the decision to take the patient urgently for left heart catheterization. Coronary angiography was normal. An echocardiogram showed mildly decreased ejection fraction of 45-50% with mild global hypokinesis. The mechanism of cardiac ischemia was thought to be likely due to clenbuterol related coronary artery spasm and/or temporary thrombosis. Conclusion: Clenbuterol has become a popular drug of abuse in athletes and bodybuilders due to its anabolic and lipolytic effects however its cardiovascular effects remain unclear. Anecdotal cases have suggested an association with myocardial ischemia in young adults using clenbuterol. Abuse of performance enhancing drugs should be assessed in young athletic patients presenting with ischemic chest pain particularly in the absence of traditional risk factors.","2019","2020-05-20 00:32:25","2020-05-20 00:32:25","","2859","","9 Supplement 1","73","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2001638323; http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0735-1097(19)33465-5","adult; conference abstract; football player; human; male; case report; clinical article; young adult; risk assessment; decision making; risk factor; human tissue; physical examination; rest; coronary angiography; echocardiography; endogenous compound; protein expression; drug therapy; family history; acetylsalicylic acid; heparin; alcohol; alcohol consumption; college; gene expression; heart ejection fraction; heart palpitation; thorax pain; sinus rhythm; urine; ST segment elevation; weight lifting; side effect; relapse; performance enhancing substance; repolarization; diaphoresis; angina pectoris; hypokinesia; adverse drug reaction; body builder; cardiovascular effect; clenbuterol; coronary artery spasm; drug abuse; heart catheterization; heart muscle ischemia; jaw; metoprolol; thrombosis; troponin","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, the potential association between left ventricle MPI and biochemical biomarkers (including iron, homocysteine, and lip-ids) in elite athletes was investigated. This cross-sectional observational study consisted of 80 young male elite soccer and basketball players (age: 18–34 years) examined for a seasonal medical check-up. Cardiological examinations and transthoracic echocardiography of these athletes were performed and blood samples were analyzed according to standard laboratory protocols. Tissue Doppler recording was acquired from the mitral annulus using apical 4-chamber view and then the tissue Doppler-derived MPI was computed. Athletes were separated into 2 groups based on MPI values (MPI ≤0.40 and MPI >0.40), and baseline demographic, clinical, and biochemical variables of the study participants were compared between these 2 groups. Serum triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein, total cholesterol, homocysteine levels, and iron parameters did not significantly differ between groups, while low-density lipoprotein level was significantly lower in the MPI ≤0.40 group (103.8±26.0 mg/dl vs. 116.8±30.2 mg/dl; p=0.043). Correlation analysis and multivariate linear regression analysis demonstrated a significant association between low-density lipoprotein and MPI. In this study, various biochemical markers were evaluated for possible association with left ventricle MPI as a surrogate of cardiac performance. Among these biomarkers, only low-density lipoprotein was significantly associated with MPI in elite athletes.","2019","2020-05-20 00:32:27","2020-05-20 00:32:27","","1194-1203","","","25","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.12659/MSM.913561; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2001617720","adult; female; human; male; article; observational study; controlled study; major clinical study; athlete; cholesterol; hematocrit; hemoglobin; iron; lipid; triacylglycerol; cross-sectional study; C reactive protein; clinical examination; transthoracic echocardiography; echocardiography; heart left ventricle; calcium; cyanocobalamin; magnesium; protein; glucose; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; potassium; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; lactate dehydrogenase; alanine aminotransferase; aspartate aminotransferase; leukocyte count; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; uric acid; alkaline phosphatase; blood biochemistry; chemicals and drugs; chlorine; creatinine; gamma glutamyltransferase; heart performance; hematology analyzer; homocysteine; iron binding capacity; medical examination; platelet count; Roche Integra 400; sodium; Sysmex XT 2000i; thyrotropin blood level; transferrin; urea","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In these specific group of patients, a reliable evaluation of the ventricular dimensions and volumes by non-invasive methods is of utmost importance to rule out potentially lethal cardiomyopathies. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) has emerged as a corner stone in the characterization of the athlete's heart and contributing to diagnosis of underlying diseases. Strain evaluation by CMR adds information regarding ventricular mechanics and little, or no data has yet been described in professional soccer players. Purpose: We evaluated cardiac deformation by measuring endomyocardial global longitudinal strain (GLS) by CMR in professional soccer players (First Division Mexican Soccer League) compared to sedentary controls. Secondary objectives were to evaluate structural and morphological changes as compared to healthy and deconditioned controls. Methods: We performed a monocentric, non-randomized, observational and control study, that evaluated the GLS by CMR in professional soccer players compared to healthy and deconditioned controls. Primary end point was percentage of GLS by feature tracking method. Secondary end point included diastolic and systolic left ventricular diameters, left and right ventricular volumes, left ventricular and right ventricular ejection fraction, ventricular mass and cardiac output. Results: From January 2017 to March 2018, information was gathered from CMR studies in 37 subjects, 20 of them being high performance athletes, and 17 healthy sedentary subjects. The GLS by CMR showed a non-significant trend towards a higher negative deformation percentage of athletes as compared to the control group of deconditioned participants: (-22.0±2.0% vs. 20.9±2.05%, p=0.36). There were no differences in the cardiac output and the indexed cardiac output (6.0 L/min and 3.2 L/min/m2 vs. 6.1 L/min and 3.1 L/min/m2; p=NS). Athletes had higher systolic (42.9 mm vs. 35 mm; p<0.0001) as well as diastolic LV diameters (60.5 mm vs. 51 mm; p<0.0001). LV mass and indexed mass were significantly greater in the group of soccer players (145 gr and 75 gr/m2 vs. 109 gr and 52 gr/m2 respectively; p<0.0001). We found no difference in the LVEF 60±2.5%; p=0.55). Conclusion: Despite athletes having higher LV mass and diameters, we found no difference in ventricular deformation values as evaluated GLS by CMR, which in turn may represent a normal and physiological adaptation. Further studies are warranted to reproduce these results.","2019","2020-05-20 00:32:28","2020-05-20 00:32:28","","203","","","40","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehz747.0201; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L630046585","adult; conference abstract; female; human; male; elite athlete; soccer player; clinical article; controlled study; body weight; sudden cardiac death; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; heart output; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart right ventricle ejection fraction; cardiomyopathy; mechanics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The challenge hypothesis and the biosocial model of status make different predictions concerning the point of time, direction, and meaning of hormonal changes. This field study investigated whether testosterone reacts to experiences of challenge during the early stages of a competition or to experiences of status change as a consequence of the competition's outcome. Over a period of 28 days, approximately 2000 salivary testosterone samples were collected from 82 football fans (53% men), while they were watching the matches of their favorite national team during the 2014 World Cup. Conducting repeated measurements across seven competitive events (i.e., matches) and over the course of each match allowed us to split vicarious experiences during each competition into phases of challenge and phases of status change. For both sexes, the results revealed discriminable testosterone trajectories depending on whether the fans experienced highly competitive matches or quick victories. By use of a discontinuous change model, maximal testosterone increases were detected during experiences of challenge. In contrast, a return to pre-contest baseline testosterone levels was initiated as soon as a status gain became certain. Testosterone responsiveness was partly moderated by the subjective importance of the competitive event. Thus, this study provides evidence in favor of the challenge hypothesis and emphasizes the value of conducting high-resolution within-subject designs to further explain the adaptive meaning of androgen responses.","2019","2020-05-20 00:32:32","2020-05-20 00:32:32","","","","","209","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2019.112596; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002239198","female; human; male; article; football; priority journal; competition; testosterone; testosterone blood level; personal experience; behavior; field study; habit; saliva level; ego; sample; thrashing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Artificial grass and natural grass playing fields were chosen to test the reactions of a sample of fifty amateur soccer players, registered for two teams between 25 and 35 years old and the average age of the sample was 34.7 (SD +/- 4.26) with an average weight of 77.4 (range 68-89 Kg.) and an average height of 178.3 cm (range 168- 187 cm). The athletes underwent three months training and competitions on each surface and the results showed a greater percentage of injuries on artificial turf fields than on natural grass. The team that carried out the first three months (November-January) taking advantage of the synthetic grass, denoted, in the following three months (February-April), an improvement in the performances in terms of continuous attendance during official competitions. Monitoring was carried out by detecting the conditions that led a player to leave the field, then to interrupt the activity, which had consequences in participation, training and matches. Injuries were classified according to the time of absence from sporting activity. Data collection, carried out through observational methods with computerized transcription in relation to the number of lower limb muscle injuries, showed that, in total, the sample of athletes suffered 36 muscle injuries (of which 5 relapses) equal to about 72 % These events occurred mostly during training (around 68%) compared to races (around 32%). There were 10 minor injuries (contractures - 27.8%), moderate ones 18 (strains - 50%) and severe ones 8 (tears - 22.2%). The affected muscle areas were mainly located on the femoral quadriceps, the biceps femoris and the calf (soleus and gastrocnemius).

Setting: Public high school. Participants: Unmatched controls (n = 760); students who sustained a sports-related concussion (n = 77); matched controls (gender, grade, sport) (n = 77). Design: Prospective longitudinal cohort study. Outcome measure: Immediate Postconcussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing. Results: At baseline, athletes who went on to sustain concussions were more likely than unmatched controls to be younger (P =.02), male (P =.001), and participate in different sports (P <.0001) such as football (concussed = 52%, unmatched controls = 20%). Differences were also noted regarding a previous history of concussion (P =.045; concussed athletes = 26%; unmatched control athletes = 16%) and lifetime number of concussions (P =.05). At baseline, those whose sustained concussions during the study period were more likely than matched controls to report numbness (P =.01) and concentration problems (P =.01) and more likely than unmatched controls to report dizziness (P =.02), sensitivity to light (P =.01), sensitivity to noise (P =.002), and numbness (P =.02). However, when data were reanalyzed and those with a previous history of concussion were removed, differences between those who sustained concussions during the study period and matched controls were no longer significant; when compared to unmatched controls, sensitivity to light (P =.01) and vision problems (P =.04) remained significant. Among those who sustained concussions, median time to recovery was 6 days (95% confidence interval: 4-9), and 71 out of 77 (92%) recovered by the fourth postinjury evaluation (median: 20 days postinjury). Conclusions: Course and time frame of recovery were variable. Data also suggest that a previous history of concussion may be contributing to baseline symptom reporting and highlight the potential enduring impact of history of concussion on sensorimotor function. However, further research as to whether preinjury measures of sensorimotor function may increase understanding regarding concussion risk is warranted.","2019","2020-05-20 00:32:35","2020-05-20 00:32:35","","E36-E44","","5","34","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/HTR.0000000000000469; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628507848","female; human; male; football; sport injury; controlled study; major clinical study; prospective study; cohort analysis; concussion; high school; longitudinal study; student athlete; sensorimotor function; dizziness; paresthesia; visual disorder; review","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Athletes are a group of people with special nutritional needs. High levels of physical activity affect the oxidation-reduction equilibrium. Higher oxygen uptake during exercises results in increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The main aim of the study was to evaluate the eating habits and the knowledge of antioxidants among athletes practicing selected sports disciplines. Material and methods. The study was conducted amongst 119 athletes, including football players, handball players, bodybuilders, and crossfit players, using a self-constructed questionnaire. The data was developed using Microsoft Excel 2010 and StatSoft's STATISTICA v.10. Eating habits were determined by assessing the frequency of consumption of selected products. The state of knowledge of the athletes was assessed using the original hedonic scale. The respondents could get a maximum of 9-10 points, which corresponded to a very good level of nutritional knowledge. Results. The average number of points earned by the athletes was 4.86. None of the athletes was found to have a very good nutritional knowledge. 17% of the respondents were found to have a good level of knowledge, 39% of the respondents - sufficient knowledge and in 44% of the respondents the level of knowledge was insufficient. The most commonly consumed products amongst the athletes were raw fruit and vegetables, herbs and spices, and tea. Conclusions. Based on the obtained results, it was established that the respondents' level of the knowledge of antioxidants sufficient. The age of the respondents and their experience in practiced sports were found to be correlated to a higher level of nutritional knowledge. Education did not have a significant impact on the level of knowledge.

Twenty athletes were selected from the University of Brasilia football team (20.95 ± 1.84 years; 71.60 ± 11.65 kg; 176.85 ± 7.28 m) in which they participated in a cross-sectional analysis that correlated fat mass (FM), lean mass (LM) and fat-free mass (FFM) by DXA, with the physical capacity tests. The significance level was plotted at 5%. The FM correlated with the initial acceleration (10 m) (p < 0.05) and with the YoYo intermittent test (p < 0.01); the Balsom correlated with the initial acceleration (10 m) (p < 0.05) and with the total acceleration (20 m) (p < 0.01). In addition, there was positive correlation of RLM and RFFM with YoYo intermittent test, and negative correlation between RFFM and BAT (p < 0.05).

Return-to-play analysis fails to take into consideration how effective a player remains once returning to competition. The aims of this study are to provide a large-scale international analysis of return-to-play and player performance statistics among professional soccer athletes following ACLR. Methods: Using publicly available sources, professional soccer athletes who have undergone ACLR between the 1996 and 2015 seasons were identified. Player metrics including statistical performance, recovery time, and return-to-play rates were analyzed both before and after reconstruction. Furthermore, player performance statistics during each of three consecutive seasons post-ACLR were compared. Results: A total of 176 athletes who underwent ACLR were included in this study. The return-to-play rate was 93.2% (164 athletes). Cumulative post-surgical statistical analysis of ACLR players demonstrated fewer games/season, minutes/season, minutes/game, goals/season, and more fouls/season following ACLR (p < 0.04). Analysis of player performance statistics suggests that athletes do not return to their baseline number of games/season and minutes/game until two and three seasons post-ACLR, respectively. At three seasons post-ACLR, athletes are still starting fewer games/season and scoring fewer goals/90 min (p < 0.04). Conclusion: Return-to-play rate is high following ACLR; however, athletes exhibit poorer statistical performance, especially in the first few seasons upon return. Our data shows that athletes continue to start fewer games/season and score fewer goals/90 min at three seasons post-ACLR.","2019","2020-05-20 00:32:41","2020-05-20 00:32:41","","142-148","","1","26","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.knee.2018.10.004; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2001286900","adult; football player; human; male; article; soccer; case report; clinical article; season; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; statistics; surgery; statistical analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of the present study was to explore the lived experiences of women head coaches to identify the extent that gender influences the English football workplace. Semi-structured interviews (N = 12) were conducted with women head coaches operating at the (a) youth recreational, (b) talent development, and (c) elite levels of the English football pyramid. An inductive thematic analysis was performed which informed the development of composite vignettes, a form of creative nonfiction. Three vignettes were developed comprising women head coaches' stories at each pyramid level. Findings from the thematic analysis identified themes of gender stereotyping, proving yourself, and confidence at the youth recreational level; work-life conflicts, limited career mobility, and marginalization at the talent development level; and tokenism, undercurrents of sexism, and apprehensions of future directives at the elite level. The vignette stories demonstrate that gender negatively influences coaches' interactions and confidence early in their career in youth recreational football; gender bias is embedded within discriminatory organizational practices which limit career mobility for coaches working in talent development; and gender is used to hold elite level women coaches to higher scrutiny levels than male colleagues. Recommendations (e.g., [in]formal mentoring, male advocacy, recruitment transparency) are made to practitioners for a targeted occupational-focused approach regarding support, retention, and career progression of women head coaches in football.

Here, we establish a network-based “response feature matrix” to characterize the magnitude and distribution of impact-induced brain strains. The network nodes and edges encode injury risks to the gray matter regions and their white matter interconnections, respectively. The utility of the metric is illustrated in injury prediction using three independent, real-world datasets: two reconstructed impact datasets from the National Football League (NFL) and Virginia Tech, respectively, and measured concussive and non-injury impacts from Stanford University. Injury predictions with leave-one-out cross-validation are conducted using the two reconstructed datasets separately, and then by combining all datasets into one. Using support vector machine, the network-based injury predictor consistently outperforms four baseline scalar metrics including peak maximum principal strain of the whole brain (MPS), peak linear/rotational acceleration, and peak rotational velocity across all five selected performance measures (e.g., maximized accuracy of 0.887 vs. 0.774 and 0.849 for MPS and rotational acceleration with corresponding positive predictive values of 0.938, 0.772, and 0.800, respectively, using the reconstructed NFL dataset). With sufficient training data, real-world injury prediction is similar to leave-one-out in-sample evaluation, suggesting the potential advantage of the network-based injury metric over conventional scalar metrics. The network-based response feature matrix significantly extends scalar metrics by sampling the brain strains more completely, which may serve as a useful framework potentially allowing for other applications such as characterizing injury patterns or facilitating targeted multi-scale modeling in the future.","2019","2020-05-20 00:32:45","2020-05-20 00:32:45","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2003720206; http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10237-019-01261-y","article; football; acceleration; controlled study; concussion; prediction; predictive value; white matter; diagnostic test accuracy study; traumatic brain injury; gray matter; disease simulation; support vector machine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study explores the neural basis of these group differences using a paradigm that simulates natural viewing conditions. Our aim was to determine if group differences could be found in sensory regions involved in the perception of the world or were evident in higher-level regions that are important for the interpretation of sensory information. We measured brain responses from 2 groups of football supporters, while they watched a video of matches between their teams. The time-course of response was then compared between individuals supporting the same (within-group) or the different (between-group) team. We found high intersubject correlations in low-level and high-level regions of the visual brain. However, these regions of the brain did not show any group differences. Regions that showed higher correlations for individuals from the same group were found in a network of frontal and subcortical brain regions. The interplay between these regions suggests a range of cognitive processes from motor control to social cognition and reward are important in the establishment of social groups. These results suggest that group differences are primarily reflected in regions involved in the evaluation and interpretation of the sensory input.","2019","2020-05-20 00:32:46","2020-05-20 00:32:46","","3380-3389","","8","29","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy206; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L631551033","adult; female; human; human experiment; male; article; football; controlled study; perception; videorecording; brain region; functional magnetic resonance imaging; motor control; nucleus accumbens; reward; sensory stimulation; social cognition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The study sample included 166 youth tackle football players over two seasons: 70 primary school players ages 9-12 and 96 high school players ages 15-18. Helmet-based sensors recorded head impacts during practices and games, and impacts were summed to provide a cumulative measure of impact for each season. Participants also were stratified by ""high intensity"" and ""low intensity"" groups based on whether they sustained high or low g-force impacts. Participants completed assessments on a variety of neurologic, cognitive, and behavioral outcomes before and after each football season. In the subgroup of 55 players who participated in both seasons, the average combined cumulative impact for primary school and high school players was 7127 (standard deviation [SD] 4670) and 6558 (SD 4438) g-forces, respectively. Neither cumulative impact nor impact intensity predicted change scores from pre-season 1 to post-season 2 on any outcome measures. Instead, younger age group and history of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) predicted worse change scores on several cognitive measures and an ADHD symptom reporting scale. In the full 166-player cohort, a computerized test of processing speed declined over time, while the remaining 22 outcome measures either did not change or improved over time. Minimal changes were observed in neurocognitive outcomes associated with participation in youth tackle football over the course of two seasons, and there was no correlation with the number and severity of head impacts sustained over that time. However, longer prospective follow-up times will be beneficial.","2019","2020-05-20 00:32:47","2020-05-20 00:32:47","","2803-2809","","19","36","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2019.6519; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629545312","adult; football player; human; male; article; football; brain concussion; clinical article; adolescent; cohort analysis; disease severity; high school; cognition; outcome assessment; child; risk factor; disease association; attention deficit disorder; age distribution; processing speed; primary school; biosensor; Riddell SpeedFlex; Speed helmet","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the absence of baseline assessment, only norm values of the general population are available for comparison with scores of concussed athletes. To evaluate whether (elite) sport specific norm values are needed, cognitive performance was compared between top-level football players and the general population. METHODS: Cognitive performance of 425 top-level football players was evaluated using the computerized test battery CNS Vital Signs. Players were split into two age groups (15-19 and 20-29 years) and test results were compared with a norm sample (n = 268) by means of age-standardized scores using Cohen's d effect size statistics. RESULTS: The younger age group outperformed the norm sample in all domains, with small to moderate effects on tests of processing speed (d = 0.58, 95% CI = 0.31,0.85), cognitive flexibility (d = 0.27, 95% CI = 0.01,0.53) and psychomotor speed (d = 0.97, 95% CI = 0.69,1.24). In the older age group, no differences were found on four out of six domains; a moderate positive effect was found for psychomotor speed (d = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.54,0.93), a small negative effect for reaction time (d = -0.47, 95% CI = -0.66,-0.28). Relative to the norm, older football players scored lower than younger football players on all test domains. CONCLUSION: Cognitive performance of elite football players may be different from the general population. It is recommended to use football-specific norm scores for comparison with test results of concussed players, and to choose an adequate control group when investigating effects of contact sport on cognition. Studies with older/retired football players are needed to further analyze potential sport-specific age effects.","2019","2020-05-20 00:32:49","2020-05-20 00:32:49","","575-584","","4","34","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/arclin/acy056; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L627765435","adult; female; human; male; football; adolescent; athlete; young adult; psychology; cognition; age; reaction time; psychomotor performance; reference value; neuropsychological test","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The incidence of neurodegenerative disease among former professional soccer players has not been well characterized. METHODS We conducted a retrospective cohort study to compare mortality from neurodegenerative disease among 7676 former professional soccer players (identified from databases of Scottish players) with that among 23,028 controls from the general population who were matched to the players on the basis of sex, age, and degree of social deprivation. Causes of death were determined from death certificates. Data on medications dispensed for the treatment of dementia in the two cohorts were also compared. Prescription information was obtained from the national Prescribing Information System. RESULTS Over a median of 18 years, 1180 former soccer players (15.4%) and 3807 controls (16.5%) died. All-cause mortality was lower among former players than among controls up to the age of 70 years and was higher thereafter. Mortality from ischemic heart disease was lower among former players than among controls (hazard ratio, 0.80; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.66 to 0.97; P=0.02), as was mortality from lung cancer (hazard ratio, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.40 to 0.70; P<0.001). Mortality with neurodegenerative disease listed as the primary cause was 1.7% among former soccer players and 0.5% among controls (subhazard ratio [the hazard ratio adjusted for competing risks of death from ischemic heart disease and death from any cancer], 3.45; 95% CI, 2.11 to 5.62; P<0.001). Among former players, mortality with neurodegenerative disease listed as the primary or a contributory cause on the death certificate varied according to disease subtype and was highest among those with Alzheimer's disease (hazard ratio [former players vs. controls], 5.07; 95% CI, 2.92 to 8.82; P<0.001) and lowest among those with Parkinson's disease (hazard ratio, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.17 to 3.96; P=0.01). Dementia-related medications were prescribed more frequently to former players than to controls (odds ratio, 4.90; 95% CI, 3.81 to 6.31; P<0.001). Mortality with neurodegenerative disease listed as the primary or a contributory cause did not differ significantly between goalkeepers and outfield players (hazard ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.43 to 1.24; P=0.24), but dementia-related medications were prescribed less frequently to goalkeepers (odds ratio, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.19 to 0.89; P=0.02). CONCLUSIONS In this retrospective epidemiologic analysis, mortality from neurodegenerative disease was higher and mortality from other common diseases lower among former Scottish professional soccer players than among matched controls. Dementia-related medications were prescribed more frequently to former players than to controls. These observations need to be confirmed in prospective matched-cohort studies.

The secondary aim of the study was to compare all TMG-BF characteristics in relation to bilateral dimorphism, as well as to compare dominant and non-dominant legs. The research was conducted on a sample which included 54 professional players aged 23.0 ± 4.4 years; body height: 182.6 ± 15.1 cm; body mass: 81.2 ± 15.1 kg; BMI: 23.3 ± 1.2 kg/cm².

This phenomenon has been observed in areas such as sports, education or business. Traditionally, the chi-square test has been used to analyze whether there are statistically significant differences in the distribution of births in each of the four quarters of the year. However, this approach is limited, focusing only on the analysis of the response variable, without taking into account the effect of a set of predictive variables. In this paper a new approach is proposed to study the relative age effect with the use of a logistic regression additive model. The new method has been evaluated with a sample of 21,639 players involved in football tournaments organized by the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) between 1908 and 2012. New conclusions have been established that the relative age effect exists regarding player age and the year of the competition in male FIFA competitions and its effect is dynamic and complex.","2019","2020-05-20 00:32:55","2020-05-20 00:32:55","","","","7","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0219757; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002389359","adult; human; human experiment; male; article; football; competition; response variable","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A further objective was to identify and present features distinguishing between the activities of players within the Defender, Midfielder and Forward formations. The study sample comprised 4426 individual match observations of 473 soccer players competing in the Bundesliga during the 2016/2017 domestic season. Data from the Impire AG motion analysis system, and the so-called ""heat maps"" it supplies, revealed areas in which players spent most time during a match, with 22 different playing positions on the pitch identified in consequence. Players in the formation comprising Defenders did not differ significantly in relation to the number of accelerations, the number of shots or the percentage of duels won. Furthermore, there were no significant differences among Midfielders in regard to total distance covered, mean running speed, the number of accelerations, the number of duels and the percentage of duels won. Likewise, Forwards did not differ in distances covered at ≥24 km/h, average running speed, the number of sprints, the number of shots, the proportion of on-target passes, the number of duels, or the percentage share of duels won. Irrespective of the formation or position on the pitch, today's game of soccer also pays great importance to the number of accelerations, as well as the number of duels engaged in, and their effectiveness.

Curved sprint can be defined as sprint with gradual and continuous change of direction (COD). Although ~85% of the actions performed at maximum velocity in a professional soccer league are curvilinear sprints, there is not any specific test to assess this ability. This study aimed to analyse the reliability of a new curve sprint test, and compare its results with those obtained by soccer players in linear sprint. Forty experienced soccer players performed 3 attempts of curve sprint (using the penalty arc) to right and left side (17 m), and 3 linear sprints (17 m) in two different days. The ICCs (inter-session reliability) were 0.93 for sprint curve right side (CSRS) and 0.89 for sprint curve left side (CSLS), considered ""acceptable"". The CVs (intra-session reliability) were 0.87% in CSRS and 1.15% in CSLS. The coefficient of determination (R2) between linear and curve sprinting was ~35%. The association between curve sides was ""very large"" (r = 0.878; p < 0.01). In summary, we showed that ""curve sprint test"" is highly reliable, and that curvilinear and linear sprints are different and independent actions.","2019","2020-05-20 00:32:58","2020-05-20 00:32:58","","1-6","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02640414.2019.1677391; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629578346","human; article; soccer player; reliability; punishment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The approaches to pathogenetic correction of these changes have not yet been established. Purpose: To study the prevalence and manifestation of over-training cardiac remodeling and to develop the new method of its pharmacological correction in young athletes. Methods: Study consisted in 2 parts: experimental and clinical and was approved by local ethic committee. Animal study followed the 'Principles of laboratory animal care' (1985) and national law if applicable. Morphological manifestation of over-training heart was studied in 30 mice underwent everyday 2 weeks course of swimming 'till exertion'. The myocardial ultrastructure was studied by electron microscopy by the end of experiment in 2 groups of mice: control group (n=14, without any pharmacological support) and study group (n=16) received 2-weeks course of creatine phosphate (CP). The state of the cardiovascular system was studied in 189 young footballers (12-16 years) sport-school attendants, who had noncommon changes on standard ECG. All the athletes underwent complex examination. Athletes with over-trained myocardium signs were enrolled into a clinical trial and randomized into 2 groups in 1:1 ratio: control and CP. The dynamics of cardiac remodeling and physical working capacity was analyzed after 4 weeks. Results: By the end of experiment stress-induced and overtraining myocardium hypertrophy (MH) and dystrophy developed in all the mice and 30% of mice died. Ultrastructural cardiac changes manifested as marked cell polymorphism and cell damage. CP enhanced physical capacity, reduced myocardial hypertrophy, limited the cardiomyocytes damaging, preserved the number and structure of mitochondria and prevented lethality in all the mice. Non-physiological myocardial remodeling was identified in 24-43 (12.7-23.8%) of young footballers. It manifested as cardiac rhythm and conduction disturbances, heart cavities dilatation (>98 percentyle), MH (left ventricle myocardium mass index >51g/m2.7), systolic (ejection fraction <55%), diastolic (E/A >2) disfunction, elevation of myocardial enzymes and stress hormones level (>1.5 norms) and abnormal QT reaction on physical exertion and recovery. In 40 (20.2%) of young athletes over-trained heart was diagnosed. CP using contributed to a rise of physical working capacity in PWC170 test by 9% to the original level, significant reduced (by 32-87%) or eliminated the structural and functional signs of myocardium over-training and normalization of myocardium repolarization reaction on exercise stress. Conclusion: Every 5 of the young athletes develops non-physiologic over-trained “athletes heart” signs. which effectively reduce by CP.","2019","2020-05-20 00:33:01","2020-05-20 00:33:01","","S31","","","26","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2047487319860046; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628581069","conference abstract; football player; controlled study; electrocardiogram; swimming; dilatation; structure activity relation; heart arrhythmia; heart left ventricle; genetic association; cell damage; heart ventricle remodeling; nonhuman; stress; drug therapy; animal experiment; animal model; heart ejection fraction; heart hypertrophy; overexertion; animal care; cardiac muscle cell; creatine phosphate; dystrophy; electron microscopy; heart muscle conduction disturbance; heart repolarization; lethality; mitochondrion; mouse; stress hormone; ultrastructure; work capacity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It was hypothesized in the present study that periodic inhalation of carbon monoxide (CO) might elicit similar physiological adaptations compared to altitude training. Methods: Twelve male college student athletes, who were well-trained soccer players, participated. They performed a 4-week treadmill-training program, five times a week. Participants were randomly assigned into an experimental group with inhaling CO (INCO) (1 mL/kg body weight for 2 min) in O2 (4 L) before all training sessions and a control group without inhaling CO (NOCO). CO and EPO concentrations in venous blood were first measured acutely at the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 6th, and 8th hour after INCO, and total hemoglobin mass (tHb), running economy and VO2max were measured before and after the 4 weeks training intervention. Results: HbCO% increased from 0.7 to 4.4% (P < 0.05) after 1 h of CO inhalation and EPO increased from 1.9 to 2.7 mIU/mL after 4 h post CO inhalation (P < 0.05) acutely before the intervention. After the training, the tHb and VO2max in the INCO group increased significantly by 3.7 and 2.7%, respectively, while no significant differences were observed in the NOCO condition. O2 uptake at given submaximal speeds declined by approximately 4% in the INCO group. Conclusion: Acutely, EPO increased sharply post CO inhalation, peaking at 4 h post inhalation. 4-weeks of training with CO inhalation before exercise sessions improved tHb and VO2max as well as running economy, suggesting that moderate CO inhalation could be a new method to improve the endurance performance in athletes.","2019","2020-05-20 00:33:02","2020-05-20 00:33:02","","","","JUN","10","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2019.00701; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628533060","adult; human; human experiment; male; article; soccer player; aerobic capacity; oxygen consumption; controlled study; young adult; running; erythrocyte; hematocrit; hemoglobin; mean corpuscular volume; normal human; venous blood; treadmill exercise; altitude; college student; endurance training; adaptation; carbon monoxide; carbon monoxide inhalation; erythropoietin; inhalation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To fulfill this aim, accumulated attacking and defensive match statistics along with the points earned at the end of each season were obtained from LaLiga (2010–2011 to 2017–2018). The analysis included a total of 3040 football matches. Bivariate correlation analysis shows that the number of shots (r = 0.42) and the number of corners (r = 0.42) were the attacking variables with the highest association to the number of points earned during the season. The defensive effectiveness against shooting conceded (r = −0.36) and the number of recoveries (r = 0.27) were the defensive variables with the highest association to the points earned during the season. A multiple regression analysis was able to explain 84.1% of the total variance in the number of points with attacking statistics and 73.5% with defensive statistics. In conclusion, shooting accuracy while attacking along with avoiding clear positions of shots from the opposing team during defensive plays are the indicators best associated with the points obtained at the end of the LaLiga championship.

J Strength Cond Res 33(11): 3030-3038, 2019-The purpose of this study was to develop 2 regression equations that accurately describe the relationship between weighted vest loads and performance indicators in sprinting (i.e., maximum velocity, Vmax) and jumping (i.e., maximum height, Hmax). Also, this study aimed to investigate the effects of increasing the load on spatio-temporal variables and power development in soccer players and to determine the ""optimal load"" for sprinting and jumping. Twenty-five semiprofessional soccer players performed the sprint test, whereas a total of 46 completed the vertical jump test. Two different regression equations were developed for calculating the load for each exercise. The following equations were obtained: % body mass (BM) = -2.0762·%Vmax + 207.99 for the sprint and % BM = -0.7156·%Hmax + 71.588 for the vertical jump. For both sprinting and jumping, when the load increased, Vmax and Hmax decreased. The ""optimal load"" for resisted training using weighted vest was unclear for sprinting and close to BM for vertical jump. This study presents a new tool to individualize the training load for resisted sprinting and jumping using weighted vest in soccer players and to develop the whole force-velocity spectrum according to the objectives of the different periods of the season.","2019","2020-05-20 00:33:07","2020-05-20 00:33:07","","3030-3038","","11","33","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1519/JSC.0000000000002580; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629684329","adult; human; soccer; adolescent; young adult; physiology; running; resistance training; cross-sectional study; procedures; exercise test; athletic performance; weight bearing; physiologic monitoring","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, it is crucial for them to manage their training load. Monitoring the heart rate is one way to estimate training load. However, there are limitations to a monitor's measurement ability in contact sports like rugby. Another method to estimate training load in contact sports is the rating of perceived exertion of a player, which is based on a questionnaire. It however takes a long time to obtain answers to questionnaires in team sports. As a solution to this problem, we developed a wearable heart rate monitor for rugby players. The garment-type monitor with flank electrodes can measure the heart rate even in rugby training situations. We also propose a method to estimate the training load from the measured heart rate. The method can be used instead of a questionnaire administered to the players and can reduce the labor in the estimation of the training load.","2019","2020-05-20 00:33:09","2020-05-20 00:33:09","","4121-4124","","","2019","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2019.8857595; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L630651552","human; human experiment; article; rugby; exercise; heart rate; controlled study; team sport; questionnaire; face injury; contact sport; electrode","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

RU is a unique sport that involves high velocity collisions with minimal protective wear and may represent a situation that could induce greater performance decrements than other sports, thus PBC could be beneficial. The application of PBC in 'real-world', as opposed to the laboratory setting, has rarely been investigated during the competitive phase of a playing season and warranted investigation. METHODS: In a counterbalanced sequential research design, professional rugby athletes (n = 18, age, 25.4 ± 4.0 years; training age, 7.2 ± 4.0 years; mass, 99.8 ± 10.6 kg and height 188.3 ± 6.0 cm) were assigned to a 12-week PBC intervention, washout period (4 weeks) and reassessed as their own controls. Total self-reported well-being, muscle soreness, sleep quality and countermovement jump (CMJ) height were assessed pre and 40 hours post 'real world' training (field and gym). Wilcoxon signed rank tests and Cohen's d were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: No differences were observed in the PBC or control conditions (p > 0.05; d 0.00-0.14) for well-being (-0.02 ± 0.08% vs. 0.01 ± 0.06%), muscle soreness (-0.01 ± 0.11% vs. 0.01 ± 0.16%), sleep quality (-0.03 ± 0.14% vs 0.10 ± 0.29%) or CMJ height (36.48 to 36.59 vs 38.13 to 37.52 cm; p = 0.54). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the administration of PBC is ineffective at enabling the restoration of selected performance parameters during the performance maintenance phase of the competitive season. To ascertain the appropriation of its use, future investigations should seek to assess the use of cryotherapies at various phases of the elite rugby union competitive season.","2019","2020-05-20 00:33:11","2020-05-20 00:33:11","","1-23","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1123/ijspp.2018-0911; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L627620813","adult; human; article; rugby; clinical article; controlled study; season; athlete; physiology; height; child; school child; exercise recovery; wellbeing; muscle; Wilcoxon signed ranks test; sleep quality; cryotherapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In contrast to the annual number of traumatic fatalities in football, which has declined 4-fold since the 1960's, the annual number of non-traumatic fatalities has stayed constant with current rates that are 2 to 3 times higher than traumatic fatalities. The purpose of this study was to describe the epidemiology and causes of non-traumatic fatalities in HS and college football players, to determine the effectiveness of the NCAA policies to reduce heat and sickle cell trait (SCT) fatalities, and to provide prevention strategies. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed non-traumatic football fatalities identified over a 20 year period from July 1998 through June 2018. Information was obtained from extensive internet searches, as well as depositions, investigative, autopsy, media, and freedom of information reports. Heat and SCT fatality rates were compared pre and post implementation of the NCAA football acclimatization model (2003) and SCT screening (2010) policies, respectively. Results: There were 187 (150 H.S., 37 college) non-traumatic fatalities (avg. 9/yr.). The most common causes of fatalities were cardiac (98, 52%), heat (44, 24%), SCT (23, 12%), and asthma (10, 5%). The majority of fatalities (127, 68%) occurred outside of the regular season months of September through December with the most common month for fatalities being August (61, 33%). Most (163, 87%) of the fatalities occurred during a practice or conditioning session (heat=100%, SCT=100%, asthma=90%, cardiac=77%). Hallmarks of exertion-related fatalities were: 1. conditioning sessions supervised by the football coach or strength and conditioning coach, 2. irrationally intense workouts and/or punishment drills, and 3. an inadequate medical response. The average annual rate of heat-related fatalities remained unchanged at the collegiate level pre (0.4) and post (0.4) implementation of the NCAA football acclimatization model in 2003. The average annual number of SCT deaths in collegiate football declined 58% (0.83 to 0.25) after the 2010 NCAA SCT screening policies were implemented. At the HS level, where there are no SCT guidelines, the number of SCT fatalities increased 400% (0.25/yr. to 1.0/yr.) since 2010. Conclusion: Most non-traumatic fatalities in HS and college football athletes do not occur while playing the game of football, but rather during conditioning sessions which are often associated with overexertion and/or punishment drills by coaches, especially strength and conditioning coaches. The football acclimatization model implemented by the NCAA in 2003 has failed at reducing exertional heat-related fatalities at the collegiate level. SCT screening policies adopted by the NCAA in 2010 have been effective at reducing fatalities in college athletes and similar guidelines should be mandated at the HS level. Conditioning related fatalities are preventable by establishing standards in workout design, holding coaches and strength and conditioning coaches accountable, ensuring compliance with current policies, and allowing athletic health care providers complete authority over medical decisions.","2019","2020-05-20 00:33:13","2020-05-20 00:33:13","","","","7","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2325967119S00303; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629238827","conference abstract; football player; human; controlled study; season; high school; retrospective study; student athlete; Internet; asthma; autopsy; heart; heat; health care personnel; punishment; sickle cell trait; overexertion; mortality rate; acclimatization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

QTp prolongation in the early recovery period (> 480ms in adults) is considered by P. Schwartz as new criterion of LQTS diagnostics. But it seems to be a big problem to make an accurate LQTS diagnosis in young athletes, because many of sportsmen have got acquired QT prolongation at rest due to bradycardia, myocardium hypertrophy, electrolytic dysbalanced and others. But QT reaction on exercise test may give additional significant information. Perpouse: To develop new criteria of LQTS diagnostics in young athletes using exercise test. Methods: 100 healthy adolescents and 202 sport-school attendance (footballers, gymnasts, biathlonists, hockey players, short-trekkers) including 118 boys 12-16 years old were underwent complex examination using a bicycle test by Bruce protocol with synchronic ECG recording and manually evaluated RR and QT interval durations. Corrected QT interval (QTc) by Basett formula and δQTc (as difference between maximal and minimal QTc during exercise and recovery) were calculated. Intervals estimation at rest, during exercise and at minutes 3-4 of recovery period. Results: Young athletes had lower heart rate (HR) and higher QT interval duration at rest and at initial load stages (25-50 Wt), due to myocardial hypertrophy and high vagal tone. All the athletes were free of symptoms and, but 3 from 220 have got insignificant borderline QTc prolongation at rest (440-460ms). QTp interval in both groups were somewhat increasing at the first exercise step (25Wt) stage, then going down beyond the original level at load peak (125Wt) and resuming the initial level by minute 3-4 of the recovery. Maximal QTc was recorded at 25 Wt load, not exceeding 450-460 ms in untrained and 460-470 ms in sportsmen. Inadequate QT shortening (QTc at peak load > 400ms), absence of QTc restoration to the initial value by early recovery (QTc at min 4 of recovery > 450ms), and significant δQTc prolongation (> 80 ms) revealed signs of myocardial electric instability and may be new additional markers of primary and secondary QT prolongation. Revealing of this signs required further examination for LQTS diagnostics. While 3 criteria had been taken into consideration sensitivity amounts up to 92% and specificity up to 68%. Complex examination with these criteria using allowed to diagnose LQTS in one girl with slight QTc prolongation at rest (456 ms). Conclusion: Not only inadequate QTc shortening in early recovery period, but also significant QTc delay at early stages of the test and QTc prolongation during exercise test (δQTc) required additional examination for exception both inherited and acquired LQTS in adolescents- athletes. These indices in combination with the other Schwartz criteria, were noted to be additional criteria of LQTS diagnostics in young athletes.","2019","2020-05-20 00:33:18","2020-05-20 00:33:18","","S125-S126","","","26","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2047487319860053; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628581590","conference abstract; female; football player; human; male; controlled study; major clinical study; sport; adolescent; child; exercise test; sensitivity and specificity; remission; rest; exercise recovery; diagnosis; girl; hockey player; heart hypertrophy; bradycardia; bicycle; electrolysis; long QT syndrome; QT prolongation; QTc interval; school attendance; vagus tone","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Normalized hip and knee strength in two age groups of adolescent female soccer players. J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2019-Limb symmetry strength measures are used for clinical decision-making considering when an athlete is ready to return to sport after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries. However, changes in bilateral muscle strength occur after ACL injury resulting in potentially altered limb symmetry calculations. Adolescent female soccer players are at increased risk of sustaining ACL injuries. Published age and sex-matched strength values in this population may be of benefit to clinicians to improve clinical decision-making. The purpose of this study was to establish normative hip and knee strength data of both the dominant and nondominant limbs in adolescent female soccer players. Sixty-four female soccer players (ages 10-18) were enrolled in this study. Subjects were divided by age into 2 groups (group 1: 10-14 years; group 2: 15-18 years). Subjects underwent Biodex isokinetic strength testing at 60°·s and 180°·s to assess quadriceps and hamstring strength. Isometric hip strength (abduction and external rotation) was measured using a hand-held dynamometer. No significant differences were found between groups on either limb in regards to quadriceps or hamstring strength. No significant differences were found between groups on either limb for hip external rotation strength. Significant differences in hip abduction strength were found between groups on the dominant (group 1: 0.21 ± 0.04; group 2: 0.18 ± 0.04; p = 0.014) and nondominant (group 1: 0.21 ± 0.05; group 2: 0.18 ± 0.05; p = 0.019) limbs.

M.","Not Every Pass Can Be an Assist: A Data-Driven Model to Measure Pass Effectiveness in Professional Soccer Matches","Big data","","2167-647X","10.1089/big.2018.0067","","In professional soccer, nowadays almost every team employs tracking technology to monitor performance during trainings and matches. Over the recent years, there has been a rapid increase in both the quality and quantity of data collected in soccer resulting in large amounts of data collected by teams every single day. The sheer amount of available data provides opportunities as well as challenges to both science and practice. Traditional experimental and statistical methods used in sport science do not seem fully capable to exploit the possibilities of the large amounts of data in modern soccer. As a result, tracking data are mainly used to monitor player loading and physical performance. However, an interesting opportunity exists at the intersection of data science and sport science. By means of tracking data, we could gain valuable insights in the how and why of tactical performance during a soccer match. One of the most interesting and most frequently occurring elements of tactical performance is the pass. Every team has around 500 passing interactions during a single game. Yet, we mainly judge the quality and effectiveness of a pass by means of observational analysis, and whether the pass reaches a teammate. In this article, we present a new approach to quantify pass effectiveness by means of tracking data. We introduce two new measures that quantify the effectiveness of a pass by means of how well a pass disrupts the opposing defense. We demonstrate that our measures are sensitive and valid in the differentiation between effective and less effective passes, as well as between the effective and less effective players. Furthermore, we use this method to study the characteristics of the most effective passes in our data set. The presented approach is the first quantitative model to measure pass effectiveness based on tracking data that are not linked directly to goal-scoring opportunities. As a result, this is the first model that does not overvalue forward passes. Therefore, our model can be used to study the complex dynamics of build-up and space creation in soccer.","2019","2020-05-20 00:33:26","2020-05-20 00:33:26","","57-70","","1","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/big.2018.0067; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L626885266","human; soccer; athletic performance; theoretical model; data mining","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: Expert soccer practitioners (n = 50) from around the world were surveyed on issues relating to the measurement of maximal sprinting speed and 12 elite youth soccer players performed two maximal 40 m sprints, measured by 10-Hz GPS units (non-criterion) and a 100-Hz Laser (criterion). Setting statistical equivalence bounds as practitioner opinion of the practically acceptable amount of measurement error for maximal sprinting speed, we assessed agreement between GPS and Laser. Results: Survey respondents reported a combination of methods for deriving maximal sprinting speed (tests, training, match) but most did not assess system validity. Median value of the practically acceptable amount of measurement error for maximal sprinting speed was 0.20 m/s. Maximal sprinting speed was 8.79 ± 0.33 m/s (Laser) and 8.75 ± 0.32 m/s (GPS), and the mean difference was 0.04 (90% confidence interval −0.03 to 0.11) m/s. Using the median acceptable amount of measurement error, we set our lower and upper equivalence bounds to −0.10 m/s and +0.10 m/s, respectively. Equivalence testing showed Laser and GPS as likely equivalent measures (probability 93.7%). Conclusion: Using expert-informed equivalence thresholds represents a novel way to assess validity in sports performance research.

Background As concussions, a mild traumatic brain injury, and other traumatic brain injuries gain notoriety amongst public awareness, there has been a rise in available computer-based concussion baseline assessments. Furthermore, states, sporting agencies, and schools are mandating implementation of concussion baselines. However, validation and standardization of these current baseline neurological tests have been remiss and are often not utilized by medical or neurological practitioners, making their utility suspect. Design/Methods We applied our neurocognitive baseline program to college football freshmen and high school aged ice hockey players. The list of baseline assessments is: eye-hand coordination reaction time using the Dynavision D2™device, stereopsis measurements, phoria, oculomotor performance, electroretinography and visual-evoked potential, binocularity, optical coherence tomography, peripheral vision assessments, and balance. Results The results suggest that this baseline program can be performed as a battery appropriate for a pre-participation examination prior to sport participation. The data derived from said baseline can be interpreted by sport, age and gender specific. These demographics can also be examined for developing normative data and useful for identifying subjects outside this normal. Conclusions It is felt that the current state of concussion baselines for athletic organizations are inadequate. We chose to identify a series of baseline tests that aremore clinically-relevant and easy to performas evidenced fromthe preseason baseline used by the University of Cincinnati athletes and noncollegiate athletes. These baselines are used as part of the standard preparticipation examination, further providing valuable insight into the development of sports vision training performance enhancement programs and extensively relied upon as a pre-season concussion baseline. We feel this model has enhanced clinical utility compared to the current wide spread computer-based neuropsychological assessments.","2019","2020-05-20 00:33:28","2020-05-20 00:33:28","","S29-S30","","14","93","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1212/01.wnl.0000581120.60195.77; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629665699","adult; conference abstract; female; human; male; football; controlled study; season; standardization; athlete; concussion; gender; high school; reaction time; ice hockey; physician; traumatic brain injury; awareness; organization; nervous system; electroretinography; eye hand coordination; optical coherence tomography; peripheral vision; stereoscopic vision; strabismus; visual evoked potential","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, being able to measure kicking strength (as a surrogate means to monitor RF status) via a simple test is needed. The aims of this study were 1) to determine the test-retest reliability of an isometric strength assessment (the “Kicker”) that closely resembles the hip and knee actions (I.e. Hip flexion and knee extension) during kicking and 2) profile the impact of match-play on Kicker force over a 72 hour period. Methods: Thirty-seven participants were recruited. Reliability testing (3 time points) was completed on 20 recreational individuals (age: 27.38 ± 4.26 years; height: 175.15 ± 7.84 cm). Post-match strength response data were collected for 72 hours after a game (match day (MD) + 1, + 2, + 3) in 17 elite junior male soccer players (age: 18.01 ± 0.76y; height: 181.62 ± 8.40 cm; weight: 70.92 ± 9.45 kg). Kicker force was measured in Newtons, using the GroinBar (Vald Performance, Brisbane, Australia). Results: The Kicker showed high test-retest reliability for both sessions 2-1 and 3-2. The intraclass correlations (ICCs) ranged from 0.91–0.94 for sessions 2-1 and 0.95-0.98 for sessions 3-2. Mean Kicker force scores (Newtons) across the 3 sessions were: 253.2 ± 69.2, 258.4 ± 64.4, 264.6 ± 62.2 and 252.7 ± 59.2, 258.7 ± 56.2, 262.7 ± 60.3 for the dominant and non-dominant limbs respectively. All typical errors (TE) were below 17.84 N for sessions 2-1 and 13.60 for 3-2. Following match-play, Kicker force decreased from baseline to MD + 1 (moderate effect: d = 0.73 ± 0.18 [90% confidence interval] and continued to decrease at MD + 2 (moderate effect: d = 0.78 ± 0.21) before increasing to the highest force since baseline at MD + 3 (moderate effect: d = 0.63 ± 0.22). The reductions at MD + 2 were greater in the dominant limb when compared to the non-dominant. Kicker force had not returned to baseline by MD + 3 (moderate effect: d = -0.63 ± 0.22). Discussion: The Kicker is a reliable assessment for measuring isometric hip flexor/knee extensor force. Kicker force is still compromised at MD + 3 and reductions in Kicker force are greater in the dominant limb ∼48 hrs post-match. The Kicker may provide a reliable and clinically feasible test that can be used to monitor kicking specific strength. This information may also be used in conjunction with return to kicking programs and to help guide return to play following injury.

Biomechanical studies have suggested that it should be considered concomitantly with the Hill-Sachs lesion as ""bipolar"" bone defects for assessing structural degradation, but the definitive number of instability events associated with the critical size has not been investigated. Purpose: To (1) confirm that the number of instability events is the predictor of a critical size of bipolar bone defects and (2) demonstrate the cutoff value of the number of instability events for these defects in rugby players with traumatic anterior shoulder instability. Study Design: Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: One-hundred forty-four rugby players with anterior shoulder instability underwent morphologic evaluation for glenoid and Hill-Sachs lesions by computed tomography and determination of the critical (a glenoid bone defect of ≥25% or an off-track Hill-Sachs lesion) and subcritical (a glenoid bone defect of ≥13.5%) size of bipolar bone defects. In the primary analysis, the prevalence of the critical and subcritical size of bipolar bone defects was investigated. In the secondary analysis, the authors explored the predictors for these bone defects and determined the cutoff value correlating with the critical and subcritical size of bipolar bone defects by applying receiver operating characteristic curves. Results: The primary analysis revealed that the prevalence of critical and subcritical size of bipolar bone defects was 20.8% and 61.8% of 144 shoulders, respectively. In the secondary analysis, multiple logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the total number of shoulder instability events and dominant shoulder were the significant factors associated with the critical and subcritical size of bipolar bone defects. The cutoff value for the number of instability events that correlated with critical bipolar bone defects was 6 for the dominant and 9 for the nondominant shoulder, whereas it was 4 for the dominant and 5 for the nondominant shoulder for subcritical bipolar bone defects. Conclusion: The number of shoulder instability events and the dominant shoulder were the predictors for the critical and subcritical size of bipolar bone defects for a shoulder with traumatic instability. Four injury events should herald caution when treating rugby players with shoulder instability.

In this sense, this study aimed to analyse the effect of number of players manipulation on intra-teams' coordination during offensive and defensive specific principles (space and concentration, respectively) application in Football small-sided and conditioned games. The intra-team coordination was measured through two dispersion variables - teams' width and length - during offensive and defensive sequences of small-sided and conditioned games with number of players' manipulation (3v3, 4v4 and 5v5). The playing phase (offensive or defensive) had a significant effect on width (F (1, 54) = 31.17, p < 0.01, ɳ² = 0:37) and length (F (1, 54) = 5.09, p = 0.03, ɳ² = 0.09). During offensive phase, teams' width and length were significantly higher than during the defensive phase. The number of players also had a significant effect on teams' width (F (2, 54) = 22.25, p < 0.01, ɳ² = 0.45) and length (F (2, 54) = 24.18, p < 0.01, ɳ² = 0.47). Were found differences between all game conditions for width. The length was significantly lower on 3v3 compared to 4v4 (p <0.01), and 5v5 (p<0.01). Given the constraints, teams had a tendency to maintain specific principles of the game (space and concentration) during attacking and defending. In addition, the increase of players on same space of play induce higher dispersion values both on attack as on defence.

Objective: To verify the history of injuries and associated variables in college women football and futsal players. Methods: The sample was composed by 46 college women athletes (22.2 ± 3.19 years; 59.45 ± 7.81 kg; 1.71 ± 0.24 m; 21.68 ± 8.08 kg/m²; 63.3 ± 42.4 months of practice), divided into three group accordingly with the modality trained: Futsal (n = 14), Football (n = 14), both of them (n = 18). The athletes underwent an anthropometric assessment, answered a questionnaire regarding their history of sportive training, sports modality, training information, and position on the field. Then, they were questioned about their history of injuries. Results: There was a high incidence of injuries (97,8%), in which the athletes who played football/futsal showed a higher number of injuries on the ankles, muscular and totals (p = 0,03) compared to the athletes who played only one of them. There was no difference in the number of injuries regarding the position on the field (p > 0,25). Additionally, there was a positive correlation between the number of injuries and body mass (r=0.42; p=0.004), body mass index (r=0.75; p=0.001) and years of practice (r=0.54; p=0.001). Conclusion: We conclude that there is a high incidence of injuries in female futsal and football players, particularly in those who plays both modalities, independently of their position on the field. The lesions were positively correlated to the body mass, BMI and time/years of training.

Regarding match physiological responses, it has been reported that mean match heart rate is between 162 and 165 beats per minute, which totals up to approximately 85% of maximal heart rate. Mean match oxygen uptake (VO2) is about 80% of VO2max. Blood lactate concentration has been reported to be approximately 5 mmol/L; however, concentrations as high as 14 mmol/L have been observed at the end of the second half. Concerning exercise planning we would like to stress the importance of speed endurance training and speed training with a prior development of aerobic fitness, as optimal physical fitness is required for quality football refereeing.

Background Sports concussion has been in the public eye and has been associated with heightened fear concerning playing football and other collision based sports. Protecting from concussion and rehabilitating the brain after a concussion is a high priority for many sports medical practitioners as well as for athletes wanting to play. For these reasons researchers associated with the American Athletic Conference (AAC) have been monitoring concussion incidence in football. Design/Methods The 12 schools of the AAC were surveyed for 2014, 2015, and 2016 concerning football induced concussions. Results The average seasonal concussion rate was 10.4 ± 1.02 concussions per year and average RTP time was 13.2 ± 1.21 days. In the one team where there was an aggressive neuro visual conditioning and rehabilitation post-concussion program employed the concussion rate was 3.0 ± 1.0 concussions per year and the RTP time was 6.5 ± 0.5 days. Both numbers are significantly lower than in the other AAC teams. Conclusions The current paper reports that there may be mitigation strategies that can be employed to decrease concussion incidence as well as aid in faster RTP times. Such attempts to make football safer are needed as brain injury has been associated with long term consequences. Improving safety and brain health through mitigation strategies along with rehabilitation methods may aid in keeping athletes safer during play and throughout the lifespan.","2019","2020-05-20 00:33:43","2020-05-20 00:33:43","","S9-S10","","14","93","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1212/01.wnl.0000580916.40209.58; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629665695","conference abstract; human; football; case report; clinical article; observational study; incidence; athlete; cohort analysis; concussion; velocity; brain injury; lifespan","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of the study was to assess the consumption of dietar-y supplements by female football players at a competitive level of athletic performance. Material and methods. The study was conducted in a sample of 44 female football players, training at three league levels: ExtraLeague, I-League and II-League. The questionnaire included the questions about the period of training, diets, self-assessment of the participants' knowledge on nutrition and supplementation. Additionally, measurements of body height and body mass were taken. Results. The sample included women aged 20.5±5 years; the subjects body height and body mass were 167.2±5 cm and 61.6±10.1 kg respectively and they trained on average 5 years or longer. 20.5% of the survey respondents reported taking dietary supplements, most of them (67%) within the period shorter than six months. The most frequent reported reasons for supplementation were: the desire to improve exercise capacity and/or someone's recommendation. Most of the respondents (65%) reported a favorable effect of dietary supplementation. The football players learned about supplementation from their dieticians and/or the mass media. Conclusions: The female football players usually used supplements consciously and took only those with the effect confirmed by study results. Dietary supplements were usually taken with caution and the sources of knowledge of the supplements were in most cases reliable.

Recent studies show an incidence of 2.3 per 100,000 in athletes as compared to 0.9 per 100,000 in non-athletes. A recent study in France reports an incidence of 4.6 per million population per year; arriving to 6% of those, in competitive athletes. As bystanders are crucial to get the best rates of survival after cardiac arrest, training athletes in BLS could impact in the overall survival. Objectives: Our objective is to assess the efficacy of our wearable CPR feedback device in a junior football team which has been previously trained in BLS. Material and methods: We had the opportunity to study the performance of our wearable device in a licensed junior football team, consisting of 23 members, and everyone equipped with our wearable device to perform cardiac massage in a manikin equipped with a potentiometer to measure real time chest depth compressions and real time compression rate. In our study we compare the results of those massages performed with and without feedback while we measure all data with our wearable feedback device to assess the accuracy of our mathematical model. Results: The age of the football players was 16.6 (15.2–17.3) years old. All of them improved their performance. Results were significative 46.71 ± 14.82 mm and 111.34 ± 25.61 bpm vs 55.89 ± 7.13 mm and 113.12 ± 8.26 bpm. (p < 0.038 for depth and p < 0.652 for rate). The accuracy was excellent showing RSME of 3.34 mm for all depth measurements with a Pearson Correlation of 0.94 (p < 0.0001) and an intraclass correlation of 0.93 (p < 0.0001). Conclusions: Omniscienzs feedback device is useful in training BLS in young athletes.","2019","2020-05-20 00:33:47","2020-05-20 00:33:47","","e58","","","142","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resuscitation.2019.06.140; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002277985","conference abstract; football player; human; controlled study; training; comparative effectiveness; compression; CPR feedback device; heart arrest; heart massage; manikin; overall survival","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: A four-season (2012/2013-2015/2016) prospective cohort study of injuries in professional level (club and international) rugby union. Incidence (injuries/1000 player-match-hours), severity (days lost per injury) and number of professional matches conferring a large risk of concussion were determined. The risk of injury following concussion was assessed using a survival model. RESULTS: Concussion incidence increased from 7.9 (95% CI 5.1 to 11.7) to 21.5 injuries/1000 player-match-hours (95% CI 16.4 to 27.6) over the four seasons for combined club and international rugby union. Concussion severity was unchanged over time (median: 9 days). Players were at a greater risk of sustaining a concussion than not after an exposure of 25 matches (95% CI 19 to 32). Injury risk (any injury) was 38% greater (HR 1.38; 95% CI 1.21 to 1.56) following concussion than after a non-concussive injury. Injuries to the head and neck (HR 1.34; 95% CI 1.06 to 1.70), upper limb (HR 1.59; 95% CI 1.19 to 2.12), pelvic region (HR 2.07; 95% CI 1.18 to 3.65) and the lower limb (HR 1.60; 95% CI 1.21 to 2.10) were more likely following concussion than after a non-concussive injury. CONCLUSION: Concussion incidence increased, while severity remained unchanged, during the 4 years of this study. Playing more than 25 matches in the 2015/2016 season meant that sustaining concussion was more likely than not sustaining concussion. The 38% greater injury risk after concussive injury (compared with non-concussive injury) suggests return to play protocols warrant investigation.","2019","2020-05-20 00:33:49","2020-05-20 00:33:49","","969-973","","15","53","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bjsports-2017-098417; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628779853","human; male; football; sport injury; injury; brain concussion; incidence; prospective study; season; physiology; competitive behavior; recurrent disease; severity of illness index; Wales","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our working hypothesis was that, as a result of the muscular contractions of the adjacent locomotor muscles, a change in the distance between the femur and the big tibia would be observed in the knee joint. We conducted experiments with two experienced individuals, football players, after informed consent. The study was performed at resting MRI test and active isometric right leg stretching. The results showed that active isometric stretching causes intracranial processes in the knee joint. A change in the distance between the cartilage surface of the femur and the corresponding end of the tibia during active isometric stretching was observed. The experimental data obtained would allow developing of models of hydrodynamic and mechanical effects in deformation of the joint capsule; the interaction between cartilage deformation and synovial fluid flow; changes in the volume of the joint capsule as a result of simultaneous loading with axial forces, internal pressure and external pressure due to the action of the adjacent knee muscles and tendons.","2019","2020-05-20 00:33:50","2020-05-20 00:33:50","","56-61","","3","33","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002871163","adult; female; football player; human; human experiment; male; article; case report; knee; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; clinical article; muscle contraction; informed consent; femur; cartilage; joint function; tendon; tibia; fluid flow; hydrodynamics; joint capsule; synovial fluid","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nevertheless, within each league, where all clubs have the same regulations, having more foreign players has no effect. In the end, when all clubs have the same possibilities for importing better players from abroad, what matters is the financial power to choose the better ones.

However, their larger diameter may inadvertently complicate on-field stabilization procedures for players with suspected cervical spine injuries. The purpose of this study was to compare the total arc of extension in the supine position before and after removal of a traditional helmet and a larger-diameter anti-concussive helmet. We hypothesized that removal of the larger helmet would result in a significantly increased total arc of extension when compared to removal of a traditional helmet. Methods: IRB approval was obtained prior to initiation of this study. Following the guidance of a priori power analysis, 27 adult male volunteers between 20 and 30 years of age were enrolled. Head circumference, height, and weight measurements were obtained before being fitted with NFL-style shoulder pads, a traditional helmet (TH), and a newly-introduced, larger anti-concussive helmet (LH). With the shoulder pads in place, each subject was asked to lay supine on the x-ray table which was equipped with standardized visible landmarks to facilitate consistent positioning between patients. Lateral radiographs were then obtained while wearing the TH, the LH, and while wearing no helmet (NH). With assistance, subjects were immobilized to the extent possible while removing/exchanging headgear between radiographs. Three cobb angle measurements were obtained for each helmet condition beginning from the most caudal aspect of C1 to the most cranial aspects of the C3, C4, and C5 vertebral bodies, respectively. Maintenance of atlanto-dens intervals were confirmed between helmet conditions in each subject. All Cobb angles were measured in duplicate by two independent observers on two occasions separated by at least 2 weeks for calculation of inter- and intra-rater reliability (κ). Statistical comparisons between helmet conditions were performed using repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). Statistical significance was declared when p<0.05. Results: Twenty-seven male subjects with a mean age of 24.0 years (range, 22.0-36.0 years; standard deviation [SD], 3.0 years), mean body mass index (BMI) of 25.1 kg/m2 (range, 21.0-31.9 kg/m2; SD, 2.7 kg/m2), and mean head circumference of 58.2 cm (range, 53.0-62.0 cm; SD, 1.6 cm). Cobb angle measurements were found to have good-to-excellent intra-class correlation (κ). Relative to NH, the average total extension arc after removal LH removal was significantly greater than after SH removal between the C1-C3 (-2.6° p=0.024), C1-C4 (-2.6° p=0.036), and C1-C5 intervals (-2.9° p=0.023), amounting to a 50-60% increased arc of cervical extension after removal of the LH relative to the TH (Table 1 and Figure 1). Conclusion: The degree of passive cervical lordosis that occurs after removal of new larger-diameter anticoncussive football helmets in the supine position is significantly greater than after removal of traditional helmets, thus potentially increasing the risk of iatrogenic cervical spine injury while attempting on-field helmet removal. Current guidelines and procedures for management of on-field cervical spine trauma in American football should be modified to account for larger helmet designs that are becoming more popular in American football.","2019","2020-05-20 00:33:55","2020-05-20 00:33:55","","","","7","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2325967119S00405; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629238847","adult; conference abstract; female; human; male; football; clinical article; calculation; controlled study; analysis of variance; body mass; concussion; helmet; young adult; supine position; practice guideline; shoulder; X ray film; statistical significance; cervical spine injury; lordosis; Cobb angle; head circumference; intrarater reliability; power analysis; vertebra body","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The results presented are based on five in-depth interviews with female elite-level coaches between 36 and 50 years of age. A feminist cultural and a gender perspective are used to understand and discuss the findings. As shown in other studies, the culture of football in Norway is very gendered. This has an impact on the female football coaches' experiences, both in relation to how they perceive their own role, their coach education and with respect to their self-confidence and how they look upon their own chances in the job market. As a group, they represent a form of pariah femininity, and very little resistance femininity and a liberal feminist perspective, i.e. equality on the men's premises.

He had a frontal retro-orbital headache and achy, throbbing forehead pain radiating into his eyes. He also had photophobia, hyperacusis, dizziness and altered vision. There was a brief loss of consciousness after the injury. A normal appearing CT of the head and cervical spine was done and the patient was diagnosed with a concussion. October 14, 2018-One day later, the patient was evaluated again at the Emergency Room due to rash over the right face, right-sided facial pain, eye pain, photophobia, headache, nausea and vomiting. Patient was then referred to Infectious Disease and Sports Medicine. Physical Exam: Patient presented to us on 10/17 Skin: Erythematous rash in a dermatomal pattern on right forehead with healing vesicles on erythematous base Eyes: extra ocular movements intact, pupils equally round, reactive to light and accommodation CV: regular rate and rhythm Neurologic: Cranial nerves II through XII intact. Motor and sensory neurologic testing intact in all 4extremities. Vestibulo-Ocular: unable to visualize fundi, macula and nerve due to severe photophobia. Negative horizontal/vertical nystagmus. Unable to complete following tests due to positive symptoms and right eyelid swelling: Dolls eye, Saccades, visual motor sensitivity, convergence, Alternating cover/uncover test for phoria. Differential Diagnosis: Preseptal cellulitis Erysipelas Corneal Ulceration and Ulcerative Keratitis Contact dermatitis Atopic dermatitis Test Results: October 14, 2018 CBC significant for:Elevated neutrophils: 75% Decreased lymphocytes:15.8%. 10/17 standard concussion testing deferred. 10/23 King Devick Cards abnormal, Convergence 8 cm, Positive abnormalities on functional neuromuscular testing. Cognitive testing: normal compared to mean on following variables:Memory (verbal and visual), visual motor speed, reaction time and impulse control. Patient tolerated activity on stationary bike for 10 minutes and had recordedHR from 100to120 without dysautonomia. Final Diagnosis: Traumatic brain injury with associated morbidity of transient immunosuppression causing reactivated Herpes (VZV) Zoster Ophthalmicus. Discussion: Herpes Zoster is rare in children, having an incidence of 42:100 000 person years. Traumatic brain injury as the stressor causing activation of herpes zoster ophthalmi-cus has not been studied comprehensively. Further, existing case studies and research focuses on adult patients and research is limited on herpes zoster ophthalmicus activation in the setting of concussion in pediatric patients. Our case presents 3 profound questions. Those being does Herpes Zoster Ophthalmicus complicate concussion recovery, does traumatic brain injury cause transient immunosuppression and lastly does concurrent herpes zoster ophthalmicus and concussion have additive negative effects on ocular health. Outcome: After 2 weeks of treatment with antiviral medications, various pain medications, anti-nausea medications, anti-seizure medications, eye ointments, limited to no school and screen time and vestibular/cervical rehabilitation, the patient's symptoms related to his concussion and Herpes Zoster Ophthalmicus greatly improved. Follow-up: As of right now, the patient has been cleared to attend school with accommodations if needed and has been approved for vigorous intensity exercise. He is following up with sports medicine, ophthalmology and infectious disease specialist doctors as well as with his primary care physician as needed.","2019","2020-05-20 00:34:04","2020-05-20 00:34:04","","e39-e40","","2","29","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/JSM.0000000000000728; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629860519","sports medicine; adult; conference abstract; female; human; male; football; unconsciousness; exercise; major clinical study; adolescent; concussion; follow up; velocity; child; memory; reaction time; cervical spine; physical examination; remission; human cell; traumatic brain injury; dizziness; nonhuman; vision; cranial nerve; communicable disease; diagnosis; differential diagnosis; infectious disease specialist; emergency ward; headache; general practitioner; morbidity; photophobia; atopic dermatitis; Hispanic; forehead; pediatric patient; swelling; saccadic eye movement; rhythm; erythema; seizure; strabismus; antivirus agent; autonomic dysfunction; cellulitis; contact dermatitis; cornea ulcer; erysipelas; eye pain; eyelid; face pain; herpes zoster ophthalmicus; hyperacusis; immunosuppressive treatment; limb; lymphocytopenia; nausea and vomiting; neutrophil; ointment; ophthalmology; optokinetic nystagmus; positive syndrome; retina macula lutea; screen time; Varicella zoster virus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Injuries to players can result in missed games1, impaired athletic performance, psychological effects2, a decline in player trade value, and lost revenue. The purpose of this study was to characterize oral and maxillofacial injuries in professional athletes of 4 major sports leagues. Materials and Methods: The Pro Sports Transaction Archive was searched for movement of players to and from injury lists between the start and end dates of the 2017–2018 season for professional basketball (NBA), football (NFL), baseball (MLB), and hockey (NHL). Injuries related to the head were included and grouped by lower face (mandible), midface (maxilla, zygoma, nose, orbits), and upper face (frontal). Predictor variables were sports league and injury location. Outcome variables were frequency and duration on injury list. Association between variables was assessed with chi-squared and analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests. Results and Outcomes Data: A total of 33 oral and maxillofacial injuries were identified (10 NBA, 2 NFL, 2 MLB, 19 NHL). The most common injury location was midface (23/33; 70%), followed by lower face (7/33; 21%) and upper face (3/33; 9%). There was no significant association between sports league and injury location (P =.663). The mean time on the injury list was 10.8 days ± 11.3 days (11.6 ± 16.3 days NBA, 16.0 ± 7.0 days NFL, 8.0 ± 0.0 days MLB, 9.8 ± 8.7 days NHL). There was no significant association between sports league and injury duration (P =.769). Although lower face injuries had longer duration (13.8 ± 14.5 days) than midface (10.6 ± 11.2 days) and upper face (5.0 ± 2.8 days) injuries, the difference was not significant (P =.659). Five injuries were season-ending (1 NBA, 1 MLB, 3 NHL). Conclusion: Oral and maxillofacial injuries were responsible for missed games in the NBA, NFL, MLB, and NHL. Despite the use of helmets, the NHL experienced the greatest number of facial injuries. Midface injuries had the highest incidence in all 4 leagues and lower face injuries had the longest recovery period. Future studies should investigate multiple seasons and longitudinal patterns to identify trends in injury frequencies. References: 1.

It is a practice that I will refer to here as the oral narrative extension of media. I describe and interpret it in the light of two conceptual frames; media practice theory and oral narrative performance. Two main arguments are developed. First, that the electronic reconfiguration of Eldoret-based fans of European fans of European football is not a closed event of mediation but rather an open-ended practice that provokes the artistic figuration and re-viewing and metaphoric coherence that constitutes extended narratives which create a mediaworld. Secondly, that this narratively performed mediaworld demonstrates the artistic process of individual performers and dynamic contexts (in)forming their performances.

This article reviews some of the factors perceived to influence football development in East Africa focusing on KUT. Using performance factors conceptual framework, this paper highlights organizational factors, which have influenced the development of football such as facilities, equipment, funding, technical personnel, incentives, external exposure, and appointment of coaches in the development of football in East Africa. It is apparent that a lot more is demanded for the leadership of soccer in East Africa if the standards of the game are to be uplifted.

Objective: To examine (1) the association of ankle-injury history with OA prevalence, (2) the association of surgical intervention after ankle injury with OA prevalence, and (3) the relationships among ankle injuries, reported OA, and daily activities in retired NFL players. Design: Case-control study. Setting: Survey. Patients or Other Participants: Data from the Retired NFL Players General Health Survey. Main Outcome Measure(s): We created a 7-category main exposure variable that differentiated respondents by footballrelated ankle injury and surgical intervention. Multivariable binomial regression models were used to estimate prevalence ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Among those reporting OA, we examined the distribution of responses regarding whether OA affected daily activities. Results: Among the 2446 respondents, 920 participants experienced OA in any joint during their lifetime. Compared with those reporting no ankle injuries, the prevalence of OA was higher among those with a history of ankle injury. Also, the prevalence of OA was higher among those who had undergone surgery versus those who had not. The number of retired NFL players who reported that OA often affected their daily activities increased with the number of ankle injuries. Conclusions: Among former NFL players, a history of ankle injury increased the prevalence of OA. More ankle injuries increased the probability that OA negatively affected daily activities. Future prospective research is needed to better determine the influence of surgical intervention at the ankle or foot on OA.

Points difference and matches won or lost were predicted with general and generalized mixed linear models. The predictors were the linear effects of number of time zones crossed and travel duration based on the teams' locations for each match and their locations in the previous week. The away-match disadvantage was also estimated, along with trends in all these effects. In 1996 the predicted combined effect of eastward travel across 12 time zones was a reduction of 5.8 points scored per match, resulting in 4.1 more matches lost every 10 matches. Corresponding effects for westward travel were 6.4 points and 3.1 matches. In 2016 effects travelling eastward were 3.7 points and 2.3 matches, whereas travelling westward the effects were 3.7 points and 1.5 matches. These travel effects were due mainly to the away-match disadvantage: 5.7 points and 3.2 matches in 1996; 5.2 points and 2.3 matches in 2016. Teams in Super Rugby are dealing successfully with long-haul travel and should now focus on reducing the away-match disadvantage.

B.","Overcoming the problem of multicollinearity in sports performance data: A novel application of partial least squares correlation analysis","PLoS ONE","","1932-6203","10.1371/journal.pone.0211776","","Objectives Professional sporting organisations invest considerable resources collecting and analysing data in order to better understand the factors that influence performance. Recent advances in non-invasive technologies, such as global positioning systems (GPS), mean that large volumes of data are now readily available to coaches and sport scientists. However analysing such data can be challenging, particularly when sample sizes are small and data sets contain multiple highly correlated variables, as is often the case in a sporting context. Multicollinearity in particular, if not treated appropriately, can be problematic and might lead to erroneous conclusions. In this paper we present a novel ‘leave one variable out’ (LOVO) partial least squares correlation analysis (PLSCA) methodology, designed to overcome the problem of multicollinearity, and show how this can be used to identify the training load (TL) variables that influence most ‘end fitness’ in young rugby league players. Methods The accumulated TL of sixteen male professional youth rugby league players (17.7 ± 0.9 years) was quantified via GPS, a micro-electrical-mechanical-system (MEMS), and players’ session-rating-of-perceived-exertion (sRPE) over a 6-week pre-season training period. Immediately prior to and following this training period, participants undertook a 30–15 intermittent fitness test (30-15IFT), which was used to determine a players ‘starting fitness’ and ‘end fitness’. In total twelve TL variables were collected, and these along with ‘starting fitness’ as a covariate were regressed against ‘end fitness’. However, considerable multicollinearity in the data (VIF >1000 for nine variables) meant that the multiple linear regression (MLR) process was unstable and so we developed a novel LOVO PLSCA adaptation to quantify the relative importance of the predictor variables and thus minimise multicollinearity issues. As such, the LOVO PLSCA was used as a tool to inform and refine the MLR process. Results The LOVO PLSCA identified the distance accumulated at very-high speed (>7 ms-1) as being the most important TL variable to influence improvement in player fitness, with this variable causing the largest decrease in singular value inertia (5.93). When included in a refined linear regression model, this variable, along with ‘starting fitness’ as a covariate, explained 73% of the variance in v30-15IFT ‘end fitness’ (p<0.001) and eliminated completely any multicollinearity issues. Conclusions The LOVO PLSCA technique appears to be a useful tool for evaluating the relative importance of predictor variables in data sets that exhibit considerable multicollinearity. When used as a filtering tool, LOVO PLSCA produced a MLR model that demonstrated a significant relationship between ‘end fitness’ and the predictor variable ‘accumulated distance at very-high speed’ when ‘starting fitness’ was included as a covariate. As such, LOVO PLSCA may be a useful tool for sport scientists and coaches seeking to analyse data sets obtained using GPS and MEMS technologies.","2019","2020-05-20 00:34:28","2020-05-20 00:34:28","","","","2","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0211776; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L626347725","human; human experiment; male; article; rugby; exercise; observational study; training; adolescent; athlete; prediction; velocity; normal human; fitness; athletic performance; global positioning system; microelectromechanical system; information processing; quantitative analysis; correlation analysis; data analysis; multiple linear regression analysis; partial least squares regression","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: This investigation is based on the control arm (10 clubs) of a randomised controlled trial investigating prevention of injuries in youth football. We conducted a prospective 20-week follow-up study on overuse injuries among Finnish football players (n=733, aged 9-14 years). Each week, we sent a text message to players' parents to ask if the player had sustained any injury during the past week. Players with overuse problem were interviewed over the phone using an overuse injury questionnaire. The main outcome measures were prevalence of all overuse injuries and substantial overuse injuries (those leading to moderate or severe reductions in participation or performance) and injury severity. RESULTS: The average response rate was 95%. In total, 343 players (46.8%) reported an overuse problem while in the study. The average weekly prevalence of all overuse problems and substantial overuse problems was 12.8% and 6.0%, respectively. Injuries affecting the knee had the highest weekly prevalence (5.7% and 2.4% for all and substantial knee problems, respectively). Girls had a higher likelihood of knee problems (OR 2.70; 95% CI 1.69 to 4.17), whereas boys had a higher likelihood of heel problems (OR 2.82; 95% CI 1.07 to 7.44). The likelihood of reporting an overuse problem increased with age (OR 1.21; 95% CI 1.00 to 1.47). CONCLUSION: Overuse injuries are prevalent in children's competitive football. Knee overuse injuries represent the greatest burden on participation and performance.

S.","Owner of a broken heart","Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine","","1536-3724","10.1097/JSM.0000000000000728","","History: Twenty-four year-old NCAA Division I football defensive-end (6'3"", 300 lbs) male with no previous personal or family cardiac history presented to the ED a few hours after a game due to retrosternal chest discomfort. The athlete complained of being ""double-teamed"" defensively with extensive exertional effort and failed to report his chest discomfort to the athletic trainers. The athlete's ECG showed ST elevation and bigeminal PVC's. He was taken to emergent cardiac catheterization that found subtotal to total occlusion of the proximal left anterior descending due to possible dissection and thrombus with subsequent acute anterior myocardial infarction. Successful angioplasty and catheter thrombectomy of the left anterior descending and placement of 2 drug-eluting stents in overlapping fashion and successful catheter thrombectomy of the circumflex ramus intermedius was performed. Physical Exam: Emergency department initial physical exam: Vital signs: Blood pressure is 142/70, pulse 82. Neck: No JVD or bruits. Carotid upstrokes normal. Lungs: Clear auscultation throughout Heart: Regular S1, S2. No murmurs, rubs, gallops, clicks. Abdomen: Soft, nontender, no hepatospleno-megaly or mass. Extremities: No clubbing, cyanosis, edema. Differential Diagnosis: Drug-induced coronary artery vasospasm Atherosclerotic-related coronary artery dissection Hypercoagulopathy Vasculitis Exercise-related coronary artery dissection Test Results: Troponin I 1.59 (N < 0.05), WBC 17.3, INR 1.03, PT 10.8, PTT 27, Hgb 15.8, Hct 46.2, PLTS 235|Protein S/C, Anti-thrombin III, Factor V Leiden, Lupus Antigen: negative|Urine toxicology: negative for cocaine Cholesterol 250, Triglycerides 87, LDL 173, HDL 60. Final Diagnosis: Extreme isometric exercise-related coronary artery dissection secondary to increased intrathoracic pressure produced subsequently from competition with possible intrinsic arteriopathy. Discussion: Drug-induced coronary artery vasospasm (ie, cocaine use) is the most likely cause of a cardiac ischemic event in the young athlete, however the college athlete in question denied drug use and had a negative toxicology screen. Spontaneous coronary artery dissection is a rare cause of acute ischemic event usually associated with the peripartum period, oral contraceptive use, vascular disease and Marfan syndrome. Case reports of exercise-related coronary artery dissection have occurred with blunt trauma and with heavy weight lifting with first case published in 1965. The pathogenesis of exercise-related coronary dissection is likely due to increased intrathoracic pressure and shear stress. Outcome: IVUS performed after coronary stenting noted dissection at the edge of the stent. Selective coronary angiography with optical coherence tomography found no evidence of significant atherosclerotic disease or dissection. By angiography, the distal portion of the LAD at the apex appeared totally occluded by a thrombus. The patient was discharge home in stable condition on day #5 on = medications. Follow-up: Athlete has not returned to sports participation given reduced left ventricular ejection fraction and concern for spontaneous coronary artery dissection. Athlete is scheduled for repeat outpatient echocardiogram to reevaluate LVEF, carotid and renal artery ultrasound imaging to rule out fibromuscular dysplasia and additional labs to evaluate for vasculitis.","2019","2020-05-20 00:34:32","2020-05-20 00:34:32","","e15","","2","29","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/JSM.0000000000000728; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629860114","adult; conference abstract; human; male; football; case report; clinical article; competition; young adult; follow up; high density lipoprotein; low density lipoprotein; triacylglycerol; blood pressure; student athlete; human tissue; surgery; physical examination; coronary angiography; echocardiography; endogenous compound; differential diagnosis; outpatient; emergency ward; thrombectomy; thorax pain; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; athletic trainer; systemic lupus erythematosus; edema; neck; heart murmur; Marfan syndrome; ST segment elevation; weight lifting; vital sign; antigen; abdomen; international normalized ratio; troponin I; coronary artery spasm; heart catheterization; heart muscle ischemia; optical coherence tomography; limb; anterior myocardial infarction; antithrombin III; atherosclerosis; auscultation; blood clotting factor 5 Leiden; blunt trauma; carotid artery; catheter; cocaine; coronary artery dissection; coronary stenting; cyanosis; drug eluting stent; drug toxicity; fibromuscular dysplasia; isometric exercise; kidney artery; lung; occlusion; oral contraceptive use; perinatal period; protein S; shear stress; thorax pressure; thrombus; toxicology; vasculitis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Research examining family meals among Latino youth is limited. Examine parental social support for healthy eating behaviors among adolescent Latino high school soccer players, including family meal time. Mixed methods using a convergent parallel design with Latino high school soccer players (n = 220; 47% female, mean age = 15.2 years) and a random subset of their mothers (n = 30; mean age 41.5 years). Multivariate analysis examined factors that influence youths' perception of parental support of healthy eating and frequency of family meals. Thematic analysis of semi-structured in-depth interviews with mothers explored contextual environment of family meals, perceived benefits, barriers, and strategies to preserve family meal time. Latino youth in our study reported eating with family on average 4.6 times per week, with no differences observed by sex (P =.087). Most (74%) perceived 'parents make fruits, vegetables and whole grains available in the home.' Among mothers, four major themes were identified: family unity, schedule conflicts, the importance of fresh foods, and family meal time as a priority. Increased family communication was identified by all mothers as a benefit. Mothers described youth's sport and parents' work schedules impact timing and frequency of family meals. Also, mothers highly valued eating meals in the home to assure highly nutritious meals. Mothers describe planning and prepping meals ahead of time to accommodate sport schedules. Mothers view family meal time as an opportunity to reinforce health and nutrition values as well as cultural practices. Recognizing the importance of family meals for Latino high school soccer players is important to preserve healthy cultural practices and family unity. NIFA.

There is currently limited information on how movement patterns and pacing strategies of rugby union players in different position groups (forwards and backs) vary when exposed to different bout types (whole game, starter or finisher). Global positioning system (GPS) and accelerometer data were collected from 100 professional match participations to determine temporal effects on movement patterns. For forwards, finishers (players who entered the game as substitutes) demonstrated significantly greater high-speed running distance (% difference, ± 90%CI; magnitude based inference and effect size) (↑ 55, ±17%; very likely large) and acceleration frequency (↑ 78, ±59%; very likely large) than whole game players. For backs, starters (players who started the game and were later substituted) displayed greater high speed running distance than whole game players (+27, ±21%; ES = likely medium) but this difference did not achieve statistical significance (p = 0.07). Forwards displayed ""slow-positive"" pacing strategies regardless of bout type, while backs displayed ""flat"" pacing strategies. Forwards and backs adopt different pacing strategies regardless of bout type, with forwards demonstrating progressively greater performance decrements over the course of the match.

P.","The pain in the leg of high school football","Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine","","1536-3724","10.1097/JSM.0000000000000728","","History: Seventeen year-old male football player with no past medical history presented with bilateral leg cramping of 4 years' duration. Patient stated cramps start in his calves during the third quarter of football games and radiate superiorly into the hamstrings, after which they are so severe that he cannot continue playing. Cramps only occur during football and not with basketball or other activity and last for 3 days until resolution. He tried orthotics, massage, stretching, heat and extra hydration before games without significant change in symptoms. He denied leg weakness, cramping in arms or dark urine during or after cramping. His mother reported patient started walking at 9 month old and was a toe walker ages 2 to 5. He denied taking any medications, previous surgeries or family history of neuromuscular disorders. Review of systems was otherwise negative. Physical Exam: BP 115/70, HR 73, H = ft 8in, W 200lbs BMI 30.4 Constitutional: Well-nourished, well-developed, in no acute distress Musculoskeletal: Nontender to palpation along medial and lateral malleoli, Achilles tendon, gastrocnemius muscle, anterior shin. Range of motion full and painless throughout bilateral lower extremities Skin: No erythema or edema in the lower extremities Vascular: 21 pulses dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis bilaterally Neurologic: 5/5 strength throughout bilateral lower extremities. Reflexes Patellar 21, Achilles 31 and symmetric. Sensation intact to light touch throughout. Normal gait. Differential Diagnosis: Chronic exertional compartment syndrome Tibial/fibular stress fracture Metabolic myopathy Achilles tendinopathy Vascular insufficiency Test Results: EMG: normal conduction of superficial and deep peroneal, sural and tibial nerves. Concentric needle EMG of right tib anterior and gastrocnemius show low amplitude polyphasic motor units with mild early recruitment. MRI lower extremity: no focal intramuscular edema or fatty atrophy of musculature about femur, tibia or fibula. Signal arising from bone is within normal limits without acute fracture. Creatinine kinase: 205 Total/free serum Carnitine, Acyl Carnitine: normal. AMPD1 mutation positive. Final Diagnosis: Myoadenylate deaminase deficiency (MADD), an exercise-induced metabolic myopathy. Discussion: Metabolic myopathies are a diverse group of rare genetic disorders that can manifest subtly as myalgia and fatigue with exertion. MADD is a recessive metabolic disorder that affects 1% to 2% of those of European descent. It is caused by AMP deaminase (AMPD1) gene mutation, which leads to energy store depletion with prolonged periods of endurance exercise. A true diagnosis is only reached with genetic testing. Treatment includes activity and exercise modification with focus on avoiding activities that exacerbate symptoms. Some research has theorized use of ribose supplementation, but there is no definitive evidence this helps prevent or treat symptoms. Outcome: Patient educated on diagnosis, as well as treatment plan which includes activity modification, symptom monitoring and frequent sessions of muscle strengthening and stretching with athletic trainer. Most patients with metabolic myopathies can participate in sports with appropriate exercise adaptations and dietary manipulation. Follow-up: He is undergoing continued strengthening and stretching with athletic trainer pre- and post-practices and games since his office visit and is currently focusing on progressive increase of running tolerance for full football games as part of his sports training regimen. He has not returned to the office for further follow up.","2019","2020-05-20 00:34:41","2020-05-20 00:34:41","","e8-e9","","2","29","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/JSM.0000000000000728; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629860491","conference abstract; female; football player; human; male; case report; hamstring muscle; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; basketball; clinical article; adolescent; body mass; follow up; high school; running; muscle training; range of motion; creatine kinase; human tissue; genetic screening; endogenous compound; heat; nonhuman; muscle cramp; sensation; touch; gastrocnemius muscle; calf (mammal); femur; differential diagnosis; family history; gait; reflex; stress fracture; weakness; orthotics; patient history of surgery; athletic trainer; endurance training; atrophy; edema; disease course; palpation; massage; diet; toe; signal transduction; achilles tendon; distress syndrome; erythema; fibula; tibia; achilles tendinitis; acylcarnitine; adenosine monophosphate deaminase; carnitine; compartment syndrome; gene mutation; genetic disorder; hydration; leg pain; metabolic disorder; motor unit; neuromuscular disease; peroneus nerve; ribose; sural nerve; tibial nerve; walker","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Primary objective: to explore parents’ experiences and perceived benefits of CP children engaging in team football. Secondary objective: to gain insights into which aspects of the activity were particularly beneficial, for translation into rehabilitation and clinical practice. Methods: A focus group was conducted with a convenience sample of parents of children with CP who regularly attended a local CP football group. A phenomenological approach explored participants’ lived experiences, using semi-structured questions and prompts to aid discussion. This allowed experiences to be shared openly, enabling discussion and topics to be varied and true to the group. Data were audio-taped, transcribed verbatim, and analysed using thematic analysis. To increase rigour, two researchers independently coded and identified themes, which matured and were subsequently agreed following further analysis and discussion with the research supervisor. Results: Group participants: 3 parents of boys aged from 4-9 years who had attended the CP football group for between 1-12 months; one child used a walking aid. Parents’ experiences and opinions of team sport within a specialist environment were overwhelmingly positive, but they recounted many negative experiences and raised concerns about attitudes within mainstream environments. A general lack of facilities and opportunities for CP children to engage in sports was a concern for parents. Four higher-order themes were identified, along with sub-themes:1. Living with a disability• Challenges to overcome • Being different 2. Safe environment• Support for parents • Positive and enabling attitudes • Inclusivity 3. Personal development of the child• Being normal • Social development 4. Physical activity• Enjoyment • Physical benefits Key themes were intrinsically linked to the environment and inclusive culture of the CP specific group, which had positive physical and psychosocial outcomes for the child. Compliance with formal physiotherapy exercises, such as stretching and muscle strengthening, frequently a challenge for children with CP, was not an issue when the children were training in the football team. Conclusion(s): Opportunity for children with CP to engage in team sport was highly valued, and considered to benefit the child both physically as well as personally, increasing independence, sense of inclusion and acceptance, and enjoyment of physical activity. Children who are more active and enjoy physical activity are less likely to depend on formal physiotherapy, and likely to engage in more activity; this in turn may prevent long-term physical decline, and psychologically build resilience and increase self-esteem. Suggestions for further research would be to explore experiences of the children themselves, to find out what they find enjoyable and consider to be the benefits of team sport. These findings could be further implemented into clinical practice, and improve adherance to physiotherapy. Implications: The project showed that team sport was viewed as positive and beneficial; however, there is often a lack of opportunity for children with CP to participate. Results could be translated into group-based physiotherapy sessions, adopting a team-based and inclusive approach. Awareness and signposting about opportunities for children with CP needs to be improved and provided to parents.

Different exposure durations at - 180 °C were tested randomly after standardized training sessions in nine professional soccer players (no cryostimulation, 180-s exposure, two 90-s exposures separated by a 5-min rest at room temperature, and 90-s exposure), and the effects on sleep quality using 3-dimensional accelerometers worn during sleep were assessed. RESULTS: The number of movements during the night after partial-body cryostimulation was significantly reduced only in the 180-s exposure condition (p < 0.05, very large effect size) compared with the control condition. Partial-body cryostimulation seems to induce a positive impact on sleep quality that may be dose-dependent.

The quadriceps femoris of the shooting lower limb is the muscle with the highest injury rate, being the exact moment of impact with the ball the main mechanism [2]. The point of this study is to verify the muscular participation in the exact moment of impact, in the three different types of kick, in order to allow the development of a prevention program for muscular injury in a rugby player. Methods: Twelve male rugby players, from Sport Lisboa E Benfica, with mean age 21.7 ± 2.7 years were selected. These athletes were able or allowed to shoot and had no kind of pain. Firstly, the athletes made a quick warm up exercise, and then, they performed the three types of kick. Electromyography analysis was used in the data collection. The chosen method was muscular activation, and the electrodes were placed in the rectus femoris and biceps femoris muscles [3]. The electromyography data had been synchronized with the tri-axes motion acceleration sensor (obtained through the Bioplux software) in order to identify the exact moment of impact between the foot and the ball. In addiction a video recording has been made to identify the beginning of the movement and the type of kick. The study was approved by Sport Lisboa E Benfica and all participants gave their informed consent Results: Through data analysis, it was possible to identify a previous muscular activation which decelerate the movements, on this case the biceps femoris, which presents a higher percentage of activation than the rectus femoris. On the drop kick, the biceps femoris is the one that activates immediately before ball impact, exactly the same that in the up and under kick and on the placed kick. On the placed kick, there's a previous preactivation of the biceps femoris. Conclusion: The study is still preliminary. It was possible to identify a triphasic pattern on the ballistic gestures made by the players, as described on the literature. Further studies, with larger samples are needed. Comparing athletes with different field positions should be interesting since different gestures implies different muscle recruitments with eventual distinct injuries.","2019","2020-05-20 00:34:50","2020-05-20 00:34:50","","S217","","","51","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07853890.2018.1560725; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628581657","adult; conference abstract; human; male; rugby; knee; acceleration; athlete; young adult; motion; warm up; muscle contraction; rectus femoris muscle; muscle injury; videorecording; pain; sensor; prevention; foot; biceps femoris muscle; extensor muscle; informed consent; electromyography; software; agonist; hip injury; electrode; data analysis; addiction; gesture; neurophysiological recruitment; shoot","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

From a total of 88 players, three developmental levels were defined: under 18 years (U18; n = 27), under 20 years (U20; n = 29), and state league (SL; n = 32). All participants performed skills tests that measured passing and tackling qualities. A MANOVA modelled the main effect of developmental level (three levels: U18, U20 and SL) with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves then built for variables that showed a significant effect. A significant effect was noted for passing over four to 12 m (V= 0.303, F = 2.406, P< 0.05), with the SL players outperforming their U18 and U20 counterparts. The ROC curves generated an area under the curve of greater than 63% for each passing test criterion, indicating greater than chance discrimination. The choice of tackle and technical execution of tackle discriminated the SL players from the U18 and U20 groups. Utilising the criteria for objective measures for fundamental skill assessment throughout RL development is likely to assist with the junior-to-senior transition of talented RL players.

"3SS27VUS","journalArticle","2019","Korte, Florian; Lames, Martin","Passing Network Analysis of Positional Attack Formations in Handball","Journal of Human Kinetics","","16405544","","","The aim of this study was to characterize handball from a social network analysis perspective by analyzing 22 professional matches from the 2018 European Men's Handball Championship. Social network analysis has proven successful in the study of sports dynamics to investigate the interaction patterns of sport teams and the individual involvement of players. In handball, passing is crucial to establish an optimal position for throwing the ball into the goal of the opponent team. Moreover, different tactical formations are played during a game, often induced by two-minute suspensions or the addition of an offensive player replacing the goalkeeper as allowed by the International Handball Federation since 2016. Therefore, studying the interaction patterns of handball teams considering the different playing positions under various attack formations contributes to the tactical understanding of the sport. Degree and flow centrality as well as density and centralization values were computed. As a result, quantification of the contribution of individual players to the overall organization was achieved alongside the general balance in interplay. We identified the backcourt as the key players to structure interplay across tactical formations. While attack units without a goalkeeper were played longer, they were either more intensively structured around back positions (7 vs. 6) or spread out (5 + 1 vs. 6). We also found significant differences in the involvement of wing players across formations. The additional pivot in the 7 vs. 6 formation was mostly used to create space for back players and was less involved in interplay. Social network analysis turned out as a suitable method to govern and quantify team dynamics in handball.

Some stakeholders have expressed concern that DFS's accelerated nature and other features might promote excessive play and related harm. We conducted the first descriptive summary of actual DFS play using records from a cohort of subscribers to a dominant operator, DraftKings. Participants (N = 10,385) initially entered paid National Football League (NFL) contests. Across all participants, players entered a median of two contests per entry day and typically submitted a single entry for each contest they entered. Players paid a median of $87 in entry fees throughout the 2014 NFL season and experienced an overall median net loss of $30.7. However, we identified heavily involved sub-groups of players based on number of contests entered, total entry fees, and net loss. These top 1% groups were less likely to restrict themselves to NFL games, exhibited greater time involvement, but also won a greater percentage of the contests they entered than typical players. Our observations of typical and heavily involved players tend to mirror those generated in previous Internet sports gambling research.","2019","2020-05-20 00:35:14","2020-05-20 00:35:14","","181-204","","1","35","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L627491289; http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10899-018-09817-w","adult; female; human; male; football; sport; adolescent; cohort analysis; psychology; questionnaire; gambling; United States; middle aged; aged; motivation; very elderly; Canada; addiction; fantasy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Peak movement and technical demands of professional Australian football competition. J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2019-The aim of this study was to determine the average peak movement and technical demands of professional Australian football (AF) across a number of period durations using an observational cohort design. This information will be able to guide duration-specific intensities for training drills. Microtechnology and technical performance data were recorded across 22 games of the 2017 AF League season. The peak 1-, 3-, 5-, 7-, and 10-minute rolling periods were determined from each game for each player for each frequency of skill involvements. Average speed (m·min) and accelerometer load (PlayerLoad; PL·min) were used as measures of physical output, and any disposal of the football or tackle was used as a technical involvement. Linear mixed models and Cohen's effect size (ES) statistic were used to determine the impact technical involvements had on movement profiles. There were substantial reductions in average speed across each duration as the number of technical involvements increased, other than for the 10-minute period. The reductions in speed were greatest during the 1-minute period for 1 (ES = -0.59 ± 0.13), 2 (ES = -1.96 ± 0.17), and 3 (ES = -2.39 ± 0.27) involvements. Similarly, less pronounced reductions were seen for accelerometer load, other than during the 7- and 10-minute periods where there were small to moderate increases in load for periods with technical involvements. Players may have to perform as many as 3 technical involvements a minute while covering 150-160 m·min.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses the example of a professional football club in China as a case study for data analysis. Based on a sample of 451 home team fans, analysis was conducted through calculation of descriptive statistics, and exploratory factor analysis. Regression analysis was conducted to determine the impact of perceived CSR performance on fans' patronage intentions. Findings: The results revealed that factor 3 (""CSR to customer and employee"") and factor 4 (""Community development and youth education"") were significantly predictive of all the three patronage intention variables, i.e. repeat purchase, word-of-mouth and merchandise consumption. In addition, factor 2 (""charity"") would also affect merchandise consumption intention, but have no effect on any other dimensions. Originality/value: A scale measuring perceived CSR performance in professional football clubs by the fans in the Chinese context has been developed. In addition, the authors have identified that the two main CSR factors that would influence fans' patronage intentions are: ""CSR to the customer and employee"" and ""community development and youth education."" Thus, if football clubs are to use CSR strategically to leverage spend, then it is these two areas that they should focus on, explicitly in relation to CSR activities. This paper adds value to an area that is currently under-researched in respect of CSR activities in Chinese professional football.

The aim is to inform effective strategies for the retention of referees, which is necessary for the sport to function. Past research has addressed perceived organizational support, internal motivation, and work–family conflict, but does not integrate these three domains. We collected data from 260 referees and used structural equation modeling to test hypotheses. The findings of this study are as follows: First, perceived organizational support had a positive effect on internal motivation. Second, internal motivation reduced work–family conflict. Third, internal motivation fully mediated the relationship between perceived organizational support and work–family conflict. The practical implications for more effective human resource management are discussed in depth and include providing network opportunities for referees, and also constructive feedback from interactions between referees and their coaches.

The ""Burnout Inventory for Referees"" was used, composed of nine items that associate the three dimensions of the syndrome, and a demographic questionnaire. Descriptive statistics and the Mann Whitney U test (p≤0.05) were used for data analysis. Results: There were no significant differences in the perception of burnout dimensions in relation to the studied variables. Conclusion: The variables educational level, arbitration level and arbitration time do not interfere in the manifestation of burnout syndrome in referees.

A cross-sectional design by means of a survey was conducted among male elite professional footballers playing in national teams and/or continental competitions. The survey questions were formulated during two expert meetings with football stakeholders (including players), covering the following dimensions: number of matches and related recovery, influence of travelling, and in- and off-season breaks. A total of 543 elite professional footballers completed the survey (response rate: 36%), of whom 55% were playing in their national teams. Around 35–40% of the participants reported playing too many matches per season with an insufficient number of recovery days in between. Nearly two-thirds of the participants reported that travelling had a significant negative impact on their recovery, performances and/or health. Elite professional footballers were in favour of an in-and off-season break lasting 14 days and 5 weeks, respectively. The findings of our study suggest that there is a need to review the International Match Calendar and implement measures in elite professional football to empower the players' recovery and performances.

Thus, this study examined the decision-making accuracy and gaze behaviour of rugby union referees of varying skill levels while reviewing scrum scenarios. Elite (n = 9) and trainee (n = 9) referees, as well as experienced players (n = 9), made decisions while watching ten projected scrum clips and wearing a mobile eye-tracker. Decision-making accuracy and gaze behaviour were recorded for each scrum. The elite and trainee referees made more accurate decisions than the players, and differences in gaze behavior were observed. The elite and trainee referees displayed lower search rates, spent more time fixating central-pack (i.e., front rows, binds, and contact point) and less time fixating outer-pack (e.g., second rows) and non-pack (e.g., other) locations, and exhibited lower entropy than the players. While search rate failed to predict decision-making accuracy, the time spent fixating central-, outer-, and non-pack locations, as well as entropy, were significant predictors. The findings have implications for training perceptual-cognitive skill among sports officials.","2019","2020-05-20 00:35:30","2020-05-20 00:35:30","","1778-1786","","15","37","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02640414.2019.1594568; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L627047445","adult; human; football; young adult; decision making; psychology; cognition; attention; videorecording; vision; professional competence; regression analysis; oculography; eye fixation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, it is unclear why this is the case. In the present study, the authors sought to determine whether perfectionistic cognitions explain this relationship and mediate the relationships between self-oriented perfectionism (SOP), socially prescribed perfectionism (SPP), and general precompetition emotions and multidimensional anxiety and anger. The authors adopted a three-wave longitudinal design and examined between- and within-person effects in a sample of 352 youth footballers (Mage = 14.03 years, SD = 2.30). At the between-person level, perfectionistic cognitions mediated the relationships between SOP, SPP, and all general precompetition emotions plus multidimensional anxiety and anger. At the within-person level, perfectionistic cognitions mediated the relationships between SOP, SPP, and general anxiety and anger plus multidimensional anxiety and anger. Our findings imply that athletes higher in SOP and SPP experience more anxiety and anger when the frequency of perfectionistic cognitions increases in the lead-up to competition.","2019","2020-05-20 00:35:33","2020-05-20 00:35:33","","1-11","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1123/jsep.2018-0317; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629450652","adult; football player; human; article; controlled study; competition; cognition; juvenile; multilevel analysis; anxiety; anger; perfectionism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To describe athletic performance, match statistics, and their relationships with the probability of achieving the first positions of the final ranking in the Italian football league ""Serie A"", season 2016/2017. Materials and Methods: Analyses comprised all the matches played by the 20 teams of the ""Serie A"" championship during the season 2016-2017. Indicators of athletic performance (total distance covered in km, jogging, running and sprint activities, and average speed) and match statistics (total shots, shots on target, goal attempts, assists, turnovers, and steals) were obtained from the Italian football league. Results: Analyses of performance activities according to the final ranking showed no significant differences for the total distance covered and speed, while a statistically significant difference (p < 0.05) among teams was observed for jogging, running and sprint activities. In regard to match statistics, all the parameters investigated were significantly different among the teams. By grouping teams into four subgroups (those who qualified for the Champions League, those who qualified for the Europe League, those who ranked intermediate positions and those who relegated from the ""Serie A"" league), the percentage of jogging, running and sprint activities, as well as match statistics were significantly different among groups, with a downward trend for total shots, shots on target, goal attempts, assists, and turnovers. The logistic regression analysis revealed that sprint activities as well as total shots, shots on target, goal attempts, and assists higher than the 3rd tertile of their distribution were associated with a higher probability of reaching the first three positions of the final ranking. Conclusions: An increased probability to achieve the first positions of the final ranking in the Italian football league ""Serie A"" seemed to be mainly related to sprint activity, goal attempts, total shots, shots on target and assists.","2019","2020-05-20 00:35:37","2020-05-20 00:35:37","","","","8","55","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/medicina55080469; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629076924","human; soccer; physiology; running; endurance; athletic performance; competitive behavior; Europe","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For this reason, most performance-pay studies on soccer use market values as a proxy for earnings. No study to date has questioned whether this fact has had any bearing on the conclusions reached in the literature. This study examines this question by comparing how certain performance variables and player characteristics affect the actual earnings and market values of soccer players in the Norwegian version of the ""Premier League,"" the so-called Eliteserien. In several important respects, the analyses show that the regression coefficient estimates differ for actual earnings and market values. It is concluded that caution is warranted when interpreting performance variables' and player characteristics' effects on market values as they were effects on actual earnings.

Methods: 12 young professional players performed three types of soccer-specific exercise: one small-sided game (SSG) and two soccer-specific training (SST: repeated sprints and aerobic runs). Each type of exercise was performed twice, at low and high training volume. Acute and delayed sessions' effects were assessed by changes in exercise heart-rate (HR) and blood lactate, counter-movement jumps (CMJ), speed and distance achieved during a final game performed after the soccer-specific exercises. Results: In SSG, the volume increase enhanced the time spent in the highest HR zone (P=0.027) and blood lactate concentration (P=0.018). Speed and distance achieved in the final game were lower after SSG than after aerobic-SST exercise (P<0.05). The next morning CMJ decreased after SST exercises (P<0.001). Sessions' HR was correlated with running distance (r=0.65, P=0.006) and the next morning changes in sprint density was correlated with CMJ performance (r=0.56, P=0.01). Conclusion: Acute negative effects of volume increase appeared after SSG while delayed negative effects appeared after SST. The present study focused on short terms exercise-induced effects; more studies remain required for controlling the full range of needed recovery durations.

Setting: Sport-related concussion management program at a regionally accredited university. Participants: A total of 83 collegiate football athletes completing their preseason baseline assessment within the University's concussion management program and a control group of 140 nonathlete students. Design: Cross-sectional design based on differential incentive status: motivated to do poorly to return to play more quickly after sustaining a concussion (athletes) versus motivated to do well due to incentivizing performance (students). Main Measures: Immediate Post-Concussion and Cognitive Testing (ImPACT), performance validity tests, and measures of cognitive ability. Results: Half of the athletes failed at least 1 embedded validity indicator within ImPACT (51.8%), and the traditional neuropsychological tests (49.4%), with large effects for performance validity on cognitive test scores (d: 0.62-1.35), incentive status (athletes vs students; d: 0.36-1.15), and the combination of both factors (d: 1.07-2.20) on measures of attention and processing speed. Conclusion: Invalid performance on baseline assessment is common (50%), consistent across instruments (ImPACT or neuropsychological tests) and settings (one-on-one or group administration), increases as a function of incentive status (risk ratios: 1.3-4.0) and results in gross underestimates of the athletes' true ability level, complicating the clinical interpretation of the postinjury evaluation and potentially leading to premature return to play.","2019","2020-05-20 00:35:49","2020-05-20 00:35:49","","E20-E31","","4","34","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/HTR.0000000000000451; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L631112639","adult; football player; human; male; article; sport injury; brain concussion; controlled study; major clinical study; return to sport; young adult; cross-sectional study; validity; student athlete; comparative study; neuropsychological test; animal fluency; coding; digit span; emotion word fluency test; immediate post concussion and cognitive testing; letter fluency; performance validity; psychometry; recognition memory test; reimbursement; rey fifteen item test; symbol search; word choice test","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Results: Compared with the hearing players, deaf players were shorter (p = 0.012), had more body fat (p < 0.001), a higher resting heart rate (p = 0.001), and ratio of Ln rMSSD to R–R interval length (p = 0.006), while maximal power output (p < 0.001), maximal oxygen uptake (p = 0.003), were significantly lower. After correcting for body fat percentage, the differences were not significant except for maximal power output value. Conclusions: Being at a disadvantage, the deaf soccer players differ from their hearing counterparts in various physiological or morphological parameters assumed to be associated with sports performance in soccer. However, the differences were minimized when taking 10% of body fat as a cut point into account. Thus, reduction in body fat percentage to the 10% level may be considered as one possible strategy for improving both the physical fitness and adaptability level of the studied deaf soccer players.

Furthermore, there is some evidence of cognitive improvement in physically active middle-aged and older adults. We hypothesized that long-term physically active middle-aged men may have developed brain resilience that can be detected with the analysis of peripheral blood markers. We aimed to analyze the activation of pathways potentially modulated by physical activity in a cohort of healthy amateur rugby players (n = 24) and control subjects with low physical activity (n = 25) aged 45–65 years. We had previously reported neuropsychological improvement in immediate memory responses in the player group compared to the controls. Here, we tested the expression of selected genes of longevity, inflammation, redox homeostasis, and trophic signaling in whole blood mRNA. Analyses were also performed on blood samples of young (aged 15–25 years) control subjects with low physical activity (n = 21). Physical activity and other lifestyle factors were thoroughly recorded with standardized questionnaires. Interestingly, middle-aged control subjects showed lower levels of expression of SIRT1, SIRT3, CAT, and SOD1 than the young controls, although rugby players maintained the expression levels of these genes at a young-like level. Middle-aged players showed lower levels of IL1B than the non-physically active groups. However, there was a tendency towards a decrease in trophic and transduction factors in middle-aged groups as compared to the young controls. A statistical study of Spearman’s correlations supported a positive effect of sporting activity on memory and executive functions, and on peripheral gene expression of SIRT1, SIRT3 and downstream genes, in the middle-aged rugby players. Our results indicate that the SIRT1-SIRT3 axis, and associated neuroprotective signaling, may contribute to the anti-aging resilience of the brain mediated by physical exercise.","2019","2020-05-20 00:35:52","2020-05-20 00:35:52","","","","","11","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00352; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L630403269","adult; human; male; article; rugby; exercise; physical activity; controlled study; adolescent; athlete; cohort analysis; young adult; questionnaire; interleukin 1beta; memory; normal human; age; middle aged; correlation coefficient; aged; brain function; gene expression; longevity; lifestyle; executive function; inflammation; signal transduction; superoxide dismutase; catalase; international physical activity questionnaire; antiaging activity; blood level; brain resilience; CAT gene; Cognitive Reserve Variables Questionnaire; gene; genetic analysis; Hamilton Anxiety Scale; homeostasis; IL1B gene; Memory Functioning Questionnaire; messenger RNA; Minnesota Leisure Time Physical Activity Questionnaire; neuroprotection; neuropsychology; oxidation reduction reaction; Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index; SIRT1 gene; SIRT2 gene; sirtuin 1; sirtuin 3; SOD1 gene; trophic signaling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

He developed bruising and mild swelling with intermittent sharp pain, worse with direct pressure and weight bearing. He presented to the ED and was placed in a splint and given crutches. Patient has a history of multiple fractures including a left tibial spine fracture 2 years ago and a left tibial spine fracture requiring open reduction internal fixation 8 months ago. Of note, patient was diagnosed with Crohn's disease just over 2 years ago by pediatric gastroenterology and was initially treated with prednisone to control his symptoms, then with Mecaptopurine and is currently being treated solely with Remicade injections every 2 months along with vitamin D. His symptoms are well controlled. Physical Exam: Vitals: BP 100/68, Height 59 3"", Weight 100 lbs, BMI 17.7 General: normal appearance, no distress CV: no LE edema Pulm: Breathing non-labored Abdomen: soft, non-obese Neuro: no focal neuro deficits, normal coordination, normal muscle tone Skin: Warm and dry, no ecchymosis, erythema, warmth or induration, no rashes Psych: normal mood and affect MSK: Right ankle-unable to do single leg heel raise, mild swelling, no effusion, no obvious deformity, tender over soft tissue and anterior distal tibia, near full ROM but with mild pain, strength intact but initiates pain, 2/4 pulses at posterior tibialis and dorsalis pedis. Negative anterior drawer, talar tilt, Tinel, squeeze test, and Thompson test. Differential Diagnosis: Bone contusion Tibial fracture Fibula fracture ATFL Sprain 5. OCD Lesion of Talus Test Results: X-ray of right lower extremity: non-displaced subtle linear fracture lucency in distal third of right tibial shaft CBC and LFT's within normal limits CRP: less than 1.0 TSH: 1.23 Vitamin D level 2 years ago: 36.5 Current Vitamin D level: 54 DEXA Bone Densitometry performed 2 years ago: Pediatric Z-scores were as follows: AP spine was 22.3, left hip total 21.8 and hip femoral neck 21.9 Future testing to be performed: Repeat DEXA Bone Densitometry and hand x-ray to determine bone age. Final Diagnosis: Right-sided tibial shaft fracture due to underlying pediatric osteoporosis. Discussion: Patient qualifies for diagnosis of pediatric osteoporosis due to Z-score of the AP spine less than 22.0 along with history of multiple fractures, the last of which was due to very minimal trauma. Patient's history of Crohn's disease and period of treatment with prednisone increase his risk of pediatric osteoporosis and therefore increase his fracture risk. Plans are currently in place for continued workup for risk stratification and need for treatment to prevent future fractures. The male athlete triad may also need to be considered as a possible contributor to poor bone health. Outcome: Patient is currently asymptomatic and showing signs of healing on x-rays and progressing nicely. We plan to continue following over the upcoming months until fracture has healed. Patient does have a repeat DXA bone densitometry and hand x-ray scheduled to determine bone age scheduled. Follow-up: Patient was in a long leg cast for 4 weeks and then recently transitioned to a short leg cast with plans for a total of 6 weeks of non-weight-bearing. He will then advance weight-bearing as tolerated and begin physical therapy. He will likely need a referral to pediatric endocrinology and a nutritionist for further workup and treatment of his osteoporosis.","2019","2020-05-20 00:35:58","2020-05-20 00:35:58","","e20","","2","29","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/JSM.0000000000000728; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629860191","conference abstract; human; male; soccer player; case report; hip; clinical article; adolescent; body mass; follow up; high school; outcome assessment; body weight; child; patient referral; swimming; physiotherapy; mood; physical examination; soft tissue; vitamin D; endogenous compound; prevention; heat; diagnosis; differential diagnosis; drug therapy; femoral neck; X ray; ankle pain; heel; weight bearing; contusion; open reduction (procedure); osteosynthesis; breathing; thyrotropin; edema; endocrinology; deformity; sprain; abdomen; muscle tone; distress syndrome; ecchymosis; erythema; spine fracture; bone age; bone densitometry; Crohn disease; crutch; dietitian; distal tibia; fibula fracture; gastroenterology; infliximab; long leg cast; multiple fracture; prednisone; Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport; splint; talus; tibia shaft fracture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Short-term deficits in cognition and physical functioning are frequently reported, and current evidence suggests such head-knocks can lead to long-term adverse health outcomes. However, the vast majority of the science has been conducted with male populations. This investigation aims to address this gap in the literature by examining SRC induced changes in brain function of asymptomatic female AFL players. Methods: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was used to explore levels of cortical inhibition and excitability in a sample of 35 current female AFL players (15 healthy controls and 19 previously concussed). Single and paired-pulse TMS assessed changes in gamma-aminobutyric acid GABAa and GABAb inhibitory processes. Prefrontal cortex blood flow was measured using functional near-infrared spectroscopy during verbal fluency and nBack tasks. Additionally, mood, personality, and behavioural surveys were administered. Result: Contrary to male-based data, no significant between-group differences were found in GABAa or GABAb inhibitory processes as measured by TMS. Though, between-group differences in short intracortical inhibition did approach significance (P =.06) There was a significant between-group difference in left DLPFC activation during the verbal fluency task, with greater activation revealed for previously injured players. Discussion: These results suggest that SRC results in players having to allocate additional attentional resources during a cognitive task. This supports previous evidence demonstrating persistent physiological changes beyond the point of clinical recovery. Notably, inhibitory cortical function was not adversely affected by a history of concussion, possibly due to time since injury or sample size rather than a sex difference. A trend towards SICI differences, combined with greater neural recruitment during verbal fluency tasks, suggests SRC may contribute to persistent changes in brain function.

The aim of this study was to verify the effect of photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) on the hamstrings’ muscle fatigue of soccer players during a simulated match. Twelve male amateur soccer players (~ 25 years) participated in this randomized, crossover, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial. The volunteers were evaluated in two sessions, with a minimum 7-day interval. At each session, volunteers received either PBMT (300 J per thigh) or placebo treatment on the hamstrings prior to the simulated soccer match. Muscle strength and functional capacity were evaluated through isokinetic dynamometry and countermovement jump (CMJ) tests, respectively, before and immediately after the simulated soccer match. Players had lower reductions on hamstring eccentric peak torque [4.85% (ES = 0.31) vs. 8.72% (ES = 0.50)], hamstring-to-quadriceps torque ratio [3.60% (ES = 0.24) vs. 7.75% (ES = 0.50)], and CMJ height [1.77% (ES = 0.09) vs. 5.47% (ES = 0.32)] when treated with PBMT compared to placebo. Magnitude-based inference supports that PBMT promoted 75%, 69%, and 53% chances for beneficial effects on hamstring eccentric peak torque, hamstring-to-quadriceps torque ratio, and CMJ height, respectively, compared to placebo treatment. In conclusion, PBMT applied before a simulated soccer match proved to be effective in attenuating the hamstrings’ muscle fatigue. These findings support PBMT as a promising tool to prevent hamstring strain injury in soccer players.","2019","2020-05-20 00:36:04","2020-05-20 00:36:04","","1177-1184","","6","34","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L625851134; http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10103-018-02709-w","adult; human; male; article; soccer; soccer player; hamstring muscle; clinical article; priority journal; controlled study; randomized controlled trial; muscle strength; double blind procedure; muscle injury; dynamometry; quadriceps femoris muscle; crossover procedure; muscle fatigue; functional status; phototherapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Even participation into organized sport may not guarantee that recommended amount of activity is reached. Objectives: Purpose of this study was to examine the amount and intensity of physical activity (PA) on days with and without practices and to find out whether daytime PA preceding soccer practice is associated with certain practice-time PA intensity level. Methods: Daily light, moderate and vigorous PA of 18 boys between 12 and 13 years of age engaged in soccer was measured for 9 days with and without soccer practices with wrist-worn Polar A300 activity meter. In addition, PA during practices was extracted and compared to PA preceding the practice session. Results: The daily MVPA was twice as high on days with training as compared to days without training both on weekdays (mean difference ± 95% confidence interval = 67 min ± 14 min) and on weekend (63 min ± 36 min). PA preceding soccer practice had a positive correlation with all PA intensity levels during practice (r = 0.34–0.84, p < 0.05–0.01). Conclusion: Physical activity should be promoted especially on days without organized practices and children should be encouraged to be physically active throughout the day as this was not found to compromise their activity during training.

The level of training at this stage directly affects the development of football in the future. Under this background, it is proposed for juvenile period, it is very necessary to study the physical training strategy of football players from 12 to 18 years old, which has theoretical and practical significance. Methods: Literature method; Observation; Interview method. Results: 1) Football sports items and load characteristics The aerobic energy supply system in football is the foundation and requires high-intensity aerobic energy supply. At the same time, the anaerobic system also needs the aerobic system to recover and replenish. Therefore, football should pay attention to the aerobic ability of the players in peacetime. 2) Physical characteristics of junior football players The physical and mental development of adolescents has different characteristics at different ages, and their physical and mental development shows certain regularity. The means and methods of exercise training can not only effectively improve their physical fitness, but also positively affect their healthy growth if they are compatible with the physical and mental development of adolescents. Therefore, understanding the characteristics of adolescents' physical and mental development, understanding the laws of adolescents' physical and mental development, and mastering and controlling these laws as much as possible is the fundamental starting point for formulating training strategies for young football players. Conclusions: 1) The physical training of juvenile athletes has a special periodicity. Incorporating the physical training of the annual competition stage into the physical training of the talented period, it is necessary to re-divide the training period of many years and years. 2) The training method must conform to the special characteristics. General physical training is the basis of special physical training. Special physical training is the basis for the improvement and improvement of special sports ability. The shortcomings of physical fitness training in China are that there is too much general physical training and too little special physical training. General physical fitness is the basis of special physical fitness. When the general physical fitness reaches a certain level, special physical fitness training is required. We use the squat barbell method to develop the general physical training requirements of the jumping strength, but the special quality requires the speed to take off quickly, and foreign players pay special attention to the training of special speed strength. Therefore, physical training must be combined with special features. 3) Strength training should occupy a larger proportion, and the strength of large and small muscle groups should be coordinated. The average natural growth rate of adolescents before the age of 15 is about 9%, the average annual growth from 15 to 18 years is about 12%, and the muscle strength between the ages of 14 and 17 is the fastest. If you can train scientifically, you can get it quickly.

This study quantified the physical demands and heart rate (HR) responses of playing ET matches in women's collegiate soccer matches and compared performances during ET to those of RT. Methods: 25 female collegiate players (age = 18-22y) played 10 ET and 11 RT matches. Total and high-intensity distances, energy expended and HR were determined using GPS, accelerometry and HR monitoring. Players were categorized a full-time (FULL) or part-time (PART) players based on the minutes played during RT. Results: For both groups, physical performance measures showed only small changes over the course of the match and were generally maintained during both ET periods. During ET, performances of FULL players were similar to PART players. Also, performances of FULL during the RT portion of ET matches were similar to those during RT of competitive non-ET matches. Conclusions: These results suggest that female collegiate players maintain physical performance through RT and during an extra 20 min of ET. The ET periodscan increase total match workload by 20–25%. This increase should be considered when addressing short- and long-term periodization strategies.

However, there is currently no research investigating the physical demands of women's rugby league. The aim of this study was to quantify the absolute and relative physical demands of women's rugby league match-play during the semi-professional 2018 Australian National Championships. Methods: Microtechnology (Global Positioning System with integrated triaxial accelerometer) data was collected on 22 players (height: 168.0 ± 5.6 cm; weight: 73.19 ± 14.56 kg) from one rugby league team during the championships. Players were categorised into the following positional groups; adjustables, outside backs, hit-up forwards and wide-running forwards. Absolute variables examined included: duration (min), total distance (m), high speed distance ([m] > 20 km·h–1), very-high speed distance ([m] > 25 km·h–1) and maximum speed (m.s–1). Relative distance (m·min–1), relative high speed distance (m.min–1) and relative very-high speed distance (m.min–1) were also examined. Differences between positions were examined via a linear mixed model with the level of significance accepted at p < 0.05. Effect Sizes (ES) were calculated and categorised as small (0.02–0.6), moderate (0.6–1.2), large (1.2–2.0) and very large (> 2.0). Results: Analysis of activity showed some differences between positional groups. Outside backs spent longer on the field (p = 0.006; ES = 2.26) and covered greater distance (p = 0.013; ES = 2.37) than hit-up forwards. Adjustables recorded a greater relative distance compared to outside backs (p = < 0.001; ES = –1.32), hit-up forwards (p = 0.001; ES = –2.03) and wide-running forwards (p = 0.038; ES = –1.32). Additionally, high speed running was greater for the adjustables in comparison to hit-up forwards (p = 0.011; ES = –0.30). Adjustables also covered a greater relative high speed distance than hit-up forwards (p = 0.027; ES = –0.94). Large differences were observed for the maximal speed achieved by outside backs compared to both hit-up (ES = 1.79) and wide-running forwards (ES = 1.63). Discussion: This is the first research to examine positional differences in absolute and relative movement demands during women's rugby league. The results show that when compared to other positional groups adjustables cover greater relative and absolute distances at high speeds. Despite the forwards having less playing time compared to outside backs, relative distance was similar, thereby indicating that hit-up and wide-running forwards play at a higher intensity. These differences allow coaches to develop evidence-based positional specific programs that refine training and equip players for the demands of women's rugby league match-play.","2019","2020-05-20 00:36:18","2020-05-20 00:36:18","","S96","","","22","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsams.2019.08.119; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002901986","adult; conference abstract; female; human; rugby; accelerometer; running; velocity; effect size; global positioning system; microtechnology; evidence based practice center","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Physical profile data and GPS metrics were collected from 17 elite referees during 205 matches. Mean match duration was 98 min and distance covered was 6 826 m. Referees produced 5% more metabolic power during the first half of a match (mean: 6.2 W/kg) compared to the second half. Referees spent 27% of the time in the ""work zone"" (speed 4.1 m/s and above). During a match, referees spent 46.8% of the time below 80% HRmax. Mean numbers of high-speed accelerations, decelerations and sprints/surges were approximately 20% lower during the second half. Comparison of between-individual and within-individual variation of referee physical performance suggests that referees generally performed consistently. Factors such as referee experience and increased rates of substitution might contribute to the reduced power measures during the second half. The results from this investigation can contribute to the development of lead rugby referee-specific physical conditioning programmes.

Fourteen professional players (age: 23.2 ± 2.7 years, body height: 178 ± 6 cm, body mass: 73.2 ± 6.9 kg) took part in this study. Twenty, physical performance‐related match variables (e.g. distance covered at different intensities, accelerations and decelerations, player load, maximal running speed, exertion index, work‐to‐rest ratio and rating of perceived exertion) were collected during two matches. Results were analysed using effect sizes (ES) and magnitude based inferences. Compared to starters, non‐starters covered greater match distance within the following intensity categories: >3.3≤4.2m/s (very likely), >4.2≤5 m/s (likely) and >5≤6.9 m/s (likely). In contrast, similar match average acceleration and deceleration values were identified for starters and non‐starters (trivial). Indicators of workloads including player loads (very likely), the exertion index (very likely), and the work–to‐rest ratio (very likely) were greater, while self‐ reported ratings of perceived exertion were lower (likely) for non‐starters compared to starters. The current study demonstrates that substantial physical performance differences during friendly soccer matches exist between starters and non‐starters. Identification of these differences enables coaches and analysts to potentially prescribe optimal training loads and microcycles based upon player's match starting status.

Peak velocity (Vmax), total distance completed (DT), total distance relative to match duration, the percentage of DT in acceleration (%DAC) and in deceleration (%DEA), and the percentage of DT at different speeds were recorded. Six types of SSGs were randomly implemented: without pitch orientation-delimitation and with a limit of three ball-contacts per player (3TOU), with no limit of ball-contacts (MAN), with a greater number of players as internal-offensive wildcard players (2WI) or external-offensive wildcard players (4WE); and with pitch orientation-delimitation and crossing the rival goal-line while dribbling the ball without goalkeepers (INV) or using official goalkeepers (GKP). The physical demands of SSGs were compared with the average of two soccer-7 match plays. During soccer-7 match plays a lower %DAC and %DEA (p < 0.05) were observed compared to 2WI, 4WE, INV and GKP, and to INV and GKP, respectively. The Vmax and %HI were greater (p < 0.05) in soccer-7 match plays compared to all SSGs. In conclusion, the demands imposed on U12 players during different formats of SSGs differ from the soccer-7 match play demands, presenting a low stimulation of the actions performed at high-speed and an adequate simulation of acceleration-deceleration actions.

Methods: The study was conducted during an annual summer camp for adolescents with T1DM. After physical examination and glycated hemoglobin measurement, 16 adolescent players completed Cooper’s 12-min running test and, in the following days, took part in two football matches while wearing heart rate (HR) monitors coupled with global positioning system (GPS) tracking. Results: Both matches were comparable in terms of covered distances, number of sprints, achieved velocities and heart rate responses. During both games, capillary blood lactate increased significantly (Match 1: 1.75 ± 0.16–6.13 ± 1.73 mmol/l; Match 2: 1.77 ± 0.18–3.91 ± 0.63 mmol/l, p = 0.004). No significant differences in blood glucose were observed between the matches (p = 0.83) or over each match (p = 0.78). Clinically significant hypoglycemia (< 54 mg/dl) occurred in two children during the first match. None of the players experienced severe hypoglycemia. Despite similar workloads, players consumed significantly less carbohydrates during Match 2 [median difference: − 20 g (25–75%: − 40 to 0), p = 0.006]. Conclusions: HR monitoring and GPS-based tracking can effectively parameterize physical activity during a football match. In T1DM patients, exercise workload and glycemic changes during similar matches are comparable, which provides an opportunity to develop individual recommendations for players with T1DM.","2019","2020-05-20 00:36:25","2020-05-20 00:36:25","","1191-1198","","11","56","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628056817; http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00592-019-01371-0","football player; human; male; article; football; clinical article; heart rate; physical activity; priority journal; controlled study; physical performance; adolescent; child; global positioning system; physical examination; carbohydrate; glucose; hypoglycemia; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; lactic acid; glucose blood level; lactate blood level; hemoglobin A1c; physical workload","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Sixteen female soccer players engaged in a pre-test of all of the variables. After having their training monitored for six weeks, a post-test was administered. The results revealed significant (p < 0.05) differences in the specific stress-recovery scales of the RESTQ-sport and in the frequency-domain variables of the HRV, although there were no significant differences in the general stress or general recovery scales. The Yo-Yo IR1 test, the Cooper test scores, and the means of the time-domain HRV variables did not exhibit any significant differences between the pre- and the post-test. The RMSSD variations exhibited very large and large correlations with the performance test and the RESTQ-sport variables, respectively. The variations in the HRV frequency-domain variables exhibited significant moderate and large correlations among the variations of the RESTQ-sport scales. Monitoring athletes at the end of the season may reveal contradictions between some variables. To help with the interpretation of these scales, some external aspects, such as athlete strain and monotony of training, should be considered.

Three online surveys were created by health professionals based on existing participation models. Surveys were completed by parents immediately before (n = 23), after the ‘Pre-Learn’ days (n = 15) and following the conclusion of the community version of the program (n = 13). Quantitative findings indicated significant improvements in child ratings around enjoyment of the sport. Qualitative analyses generated three themes around enjoyment in a low-stress environment; the education provided around the sport for parents/children; and, contemplation about playing the football program within their community. Four families (22% of the original attendees) went on to play the sport within a community setting. Despite acknowledged limitations, this study demonstrates preliminary evidence in support of an ‘AllPlay Pre-Learn’ day as a stepping stone to facilitate later participation in a football program within a child’s community. Increased participation would allow children to experience the benefits associated with sport participation, such as motor and social skill development.","2019","2020-05-20 00:36:32","2020-05-20 00:36:32","","","","24","16","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph16245058; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2003270518","female; human; male; article; football; physical activity; child; motor performance; anxiety; health survey; personal experience; quantitative analysis; pilot study; program evaluation; disability; social participation; Australian; health practitioner; qualitative analysis; social competence; community program; online system; program acceptability; psychological feedback","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The efficacy of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) for augmentation of non-operative treatment of partial musculotendinous hamstring injuries has not yet been established. Methods: NFL players from a single team who sustained acute grade 2 hamstring injuries as diagnosed on MRI by a musculoskeletal radiologist from 2009 to 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. Average days, practices, and games missed were recorded. Players that did and did not receive PRP injections were compared. Those who received PRP did so within 24 to 48 hours after injury. Results: Ninety-four NFL players had MRI evidence of a hamstring injury, while 61 athletes sustained grade 2 injuries. Thirty-one were treated with PRP injections and 30 were not. Average time missed in those treated with PRP injections was 22.4 days, 18.5 practices, and 1.7 games. In those who did not receive PRP injections, time missed was 25.8 days (p = 0.81), 22.2 practices (p = 0.68), and 2.7 games (p < 0.05). Conclusion: PRP injection treatment for acute grade 2 hamstring injuries in NFL players allows for faster return to play with a 1 game overall difference. Due to the possible large financial impact of return to play 1 game sooner, PRP injections for treatment of grade 2 hamstring injuries may be advantageous in professional athletes. Additional evaluation of PRP treatment of acute hamstring injuries in a larger cohort is necessary.","2019","2020-05-20 00:36:36","2020-05-20 00:36:36","","","","7","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2325967119S00425; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629239126","conference abstract; human; football; case report; hamstring muscle; injury; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; clinical article; retrospective study; professional athlete; musculoskeletal radiologist; drug therapy; thrombocyte rich plasma","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Twenty‐one national‐level soccer players were distributed in the following specific positional roles: external defenders (ED) (n = 4), central defenders (CD) (n = 4), midfielders (M) (n = 5), external midfielders (EM) (n = 4) and attackers (A) (n = 4). A total of 12 matches played by a Spanish Third Division team during the 2016/2017 season were analyzed. WIMU PROTM inertial devices (RealTrack System, Almeria, Spain) were used for recording the data. The main results were: (1) a performance reduction in both variables over the course of match time, (2) significant differences in both variables based on the specific position, (3) differences in physical demands during the season matches, (4) winning during a game period and the condition of being the visitor team provoked higher demands, and (5) a high correlation between both variables in soccer. In conclusion, different contextual variables influence the external load demands; both indexes are related so they could be used for external load quantification, and it is necessary to analyze physical demands of the competition for a specific and individualized load design in training sessions.

In a market logic, these players become a scarce asset. They are intensely sought out by teams, which results in an intense migration flow of footballers. Portuguese football is also imbedded in these migrations dynamics. Although it is not a new phenomenon in recent years, Portugal has become a crossroads of migratory flows players, with a large number of foreign players to reach national clubs, and many Portuguese players to go to foreign clubs. The aim of this paper is to observe the migratory trends of football players in Portugal, and identify the migratory routes not only of the foreign players who arrived in Portugal, but also of the Portuguese players who go abroad.

Although several risk factors have been proposed, the association between the playing surface and development of fifth metatarsal stress fractures (MT-5) has not been evaluated. We conducted an epidemiological study using a computer-based survey to investigate the association between the playing surface and development of MT-5. Methods This study included 1854 football players, of which 41 experienced MT-5 within the past 24 months. Baseline demographic data and the percentage of time spent playing on artificial turf and clay fields were compared between the non-MT-5 and MT-5 player groups, and the risks for development of MT-5 associated with the playing surfaces were estimated by univariate and multivariate analyses. Results There were significant differences in body mass index, years of play, playing categories and playing time on artificial turf between non-MT-5 and MT-5 groups (p<0.05). Generalised estimating equations analyses adjusted for multiple confounders demonstrated that relative to the risk of playing <20% of the time on each surface, the OR (OR: 95% CI) for MT-5 for playing on artificial turf >80% of the time increased (3.44: 1.65 to 7.18), and for playing on a clay field 61%-80% of the time, the OR decreased (0.25: 0.11 to 0.59). Conclusions A higher percentage of playing time on an artificial turf was a risk factor for developing MT-5 in football players.

Position-specific body composition values in female collegiate rugby union athletes. J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2019-Rugby union is a full-contact, intermittent team sport. Anthropometric characteristics of rugby union athletes have been shown to influence suitability for a given position and affect performance. However, little anthropometric data exist in female rugby union athletes. Thus, the purpose of this study was to report position-specific anthropometric, body composition, and bone density values in female collegiate rugby union athletes and to identify between-position differences in these variables. This investigation was a cross-sectional study involving 101 female collegiate rugby union athletes, categorized as forwards and backs as well as by position (props, hookers, locks, flankers, number 8 forwards, halfback, fly-half, centers, wings, and fullbacks). Anthropometric characteristics of all athletes were measured, and body composition was assessed via dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Outcome variables included age, height, body mass, BMI, body fat percentage, fat mass (FM), FM index, fat-free mass (FFM), FFM index, lean soft tissue, bone mineral content, bone mineral area, and bone mineral density. Anthropometric and body composition differences between forwards and backs were identified via independent t-tests and Mann-Whitney U tests, depending on normality of the variable. Between-position differences were assessed using one-way analysis of variances (ANOVAs) with Tukey post-hoc comparisons or Welch's ANOVA with Dunnett's T3 post-hoc test. Significant differences (p < 0.014) were identified between forwards and backs for every anthropometric variable, with forwards displaying greater height (167.7 ± 7.2 cm), body mass (81.5 ± 15.1 kg), and body fat percentage (28.2 ± 6.1%) relative to backs (164.5 ± 5.1 cm; 64.5 ± 7.7 kg; 21.9 ± 3.7%). Likewise, significant differences were identified for every anthropometric variable between several positions (p < 0.01). Significant (p < 0.05) interposition differences were identified within the subgroup of forwards, but not within the subgroup of backs. The present investigation is the first to report position-specific anthropometric and body composition data in female collegiate rugby union athletes.

The present study is an observational, randomized cross-sectional research, where thirty-eight players (24.7 ± 3.9 years) performed a series of tests that consisted of physical fitness (horizontal jump, abdominal curl, push up, 10, 20 and 30 m sprint speed), anthropometric and RAST assessments. The players were classified into three groups: skill players (n = 14), big skill players (n = 10), and linemen (n = 14). One-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni test presented no difference between groups for anthropometric, horizontal jump, push up, T agility, 10, 20, and 30 m sprint speed tests and all anaerobic indices computed (p > 0.05). However, higher abdominal curl performance was noted under skill player versus big skill player group (p = 0.045). In big skill players group, the relationship between 10, 20 and 30 m sprint speed and muscle power reduction index was great.

Research has shown, however, that positive thinking in the form of fantasies about achieving an idealised future predicts less (not more) effort and success and more (not less) depressive symptoms over time. This relationship was mediated by people having invested little effort and achieved little success. Here, we ask a different question. We investigate the emotional consequences of positive fantasies about futures that people cannot act on. Specifically, we analyse these consequences when the future fantasies fail to come true (one’s favourite soccer team loses). Study 1 provided correlational evidence. The more positively soccer fans fantasised about their favourite team winning an upcoming match, the stronger were their negative emotions when their team lost. That is, the more sad, disappointed, and frustrated they felt. Study 2 provided experimental evidence. Soccer fans who were led to fantasise positively about their team winning an upcoming match reported feeling stronger negative emotions after their team lost than those who were led to fantasise negatively. Positive fantasies were not related to how positive participants felt after their team won (joy, happiness, relief). We discuss theoretical and applied implications for emotion regulation in everyday life.","2019","2020-05-20 00:36:51","2020-05-20 00:36:51","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02699931.2019.1703649; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2003916926","adult; female; human; human experiment; male; theoretical study; article; soccer; expectation; depression; field study; thinking; emotionality; happiness; fantasy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The patient endorsed his symptoms began 1 month prior after sustaining 2 successive concussions within 1 week although he could not remember specific inciting injuries. He withheld his symptoms from others but was removed from practice after he was noted to be stumbling on the field. He was seen by both a sports physician and pediatric neurologist who advised he was suffering from post-concussion syndrome and recommended cognitive/physical rest. The patient's symptoms continued to progress which led to his hospital-ization. By September 14, 2017 he was experiencing bilateral temporal visual field deficits, ataxia and LUE/LLE hemiparesis. Physical Exam: September 11, 2018 AFVSS. No oropharyn-geal exudates or cervical lymphadenopathy, RRR, CTAB, soft non-tender abdomen, non-edematous extremities, no skin lesions, appears drowsy and minimally confused (does not know the month), no hallucinations, PERRL, CN 2 to 12 grossly intact, motor/sensory nonfocal, reflexes 2/4, mildly impaired tandem gait, no meningeal signs. By 9/14, new findings included bitemporal hemianopsia, mild LUE/LLE hemiparesis and ataxic gait. Differential Diagnosis: 1.

Final Diagnosis: ADEM-a rare post-infectious (ie, MONO) autoimmune phenomenon demyelinating disease of the central nervous system found most commonly in children presenting with neuro deficits and encephalopathy. Discussion: By September 14, 2017 with clinical and imaging findings congruent the diagnosis of ADEM was made and the patient was initiated on methylprednisolone 1 G IV 3 = days. The patient responded well and by day 5 was discharged home on a Prednisone taper and with outpatient neurology follow-up. I believe this case should serve to raise awareness on the similarities (ie, headache, somnolence, nausea/vomiting, visual disturbances, balance difficulties) between post-concussion syndrome and ADEM. Additionally, I feel this case serves as a reminder that cognitive errors such as premature closure and anchoring biases can result in delayed and/or inaccurate diagnoses with resultant harmful sequela. Outcome: At 3 month follow-up the patient had recovered complete neurologic functioning (typical of ADEM). Follow-up: At 3 month follow-up the patient had resumed exercising and light activities but is no longer playing football.","2019","2020-05-20 00:36:55","2020-05-20 00:36:55","","e25","","2","29","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/JSM.0000000000000728; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629860274","conference abstract; football player; human; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; controlled study; adolescent; follow up; child; human tissue; physical examination; complication; African American; endogenous compound; awareness; nonhuman; visual field; diagnosis; differential diagnosis; drug therapy; Human immunodeficiency virus; outpatient; reflex; headache; hemiparesis; alcohol; thyrotropin; cerebrospinal fluid; real time polymerase chain reaction; postconcussion syndrome; immunoglobulin M; skin defect; neurology; abdomen; cetrimide; limb; nausea and vomiting; prednisone; acute disseminated encephalomyelitis; ataxic gait; balance impairment; cerebellar peduncle; cervical lymphadenopathy; cytidine phosphate; Epstein Barr virus; exudate; hallucination; hemianopia; Human alphaherpesvirus 1; immunoglobulin G2; influenza; lymph; mammillary body; meningitis; methylprednisolone; multiple sclerosis; neurologist; oligoclonal band; optic chiasm; pons; somnolence; subdural hematoma; Toxoplasma; urine culture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Postural control responses to different acute and chronic training load profiles in professional rugby union. J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2019-The current investigation identified the response of postural control (PC) measures of single-leg balance and landing to different accumulated training load profiles representing normal, higher, and spiked loads. Twenty-two professional rugby union players performed single-leg balance and landing tests on a 1,000-Hz force plate on the first training day of 24 weeks across the season after 36 hours of recovery. Internal (session rating of perceived exertion training load) and external (total and high-speed running distance) load measures were monitored during all training sessions and matches. Calculations of acute (7-day rolling average), chronic (28-day rolling average), and acute-to-chronic workload ratio were determined. Three-week load profiles were identified that represented normal, spike, and higher load profiles to determine the effect on PC, which were analyzed using 2-way repeated-measures analysis of variance. A significant effect of load profile on landing impulse on the dominant (p = 0.005) and nondominant legs (p = 0.001) was identified, with significantly greater impulse measures in the spike and higher load profiles (p = 0.001-0.041) compared with the normal load profile. Significant load profile × week interactions (p < 0.05) were identified for landing peak force on the dominant leg and impulse on both legs suggesting a decrement during the spike load profile and increased impulse in the higher load profile. No effects (p > 0.05) were identified for load profile changes in single-leg balance sway velocity or single-leg landing time to stabilization. The respective landing responses may indicate altered movement strategies under spike and higher load profiles resulting from neuromuscular fatigue in response to the accumulated load.","2019","2020-05-20 00:36:59","2020-05-20 00:36:59","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1519/JSC.0000000000003385; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629879026","human; article; rugby; exercise; calculation; controlled study; season; workload; analysis of variance; running; velocity; leg; muscle weakness; spike","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A contemporary player of team sports should be characterized by a high level of skills and motor skills that condition them. One of the important motor skills that allow the player to start faster, dribble and achieve a stronger shot is called explosive power. On the other hand, the efficient operation of the biokinetics chain based on appropriate movement patterns is extremely important in achieving success in sport. Evaluation of the quality of movement patterns is the basic activity of coaches and physiotherapists in staff training. The study was an attempt to assess the differences in the level of explosive power and the functional capabilities of the players compared with non-training persons, while assessing the relationship between the level of explosive strength of the lower limbs and the functional capabilities of the subjects. Material and methods. The research carried out in 2017 covered the group of footballers (n = 25) training in the fourth league club and non-trainers in the similar age bracket (n = 25). During the tests, measurements of somatic features and indicators were made. The Myotest (Switerzland) device was used to measure explosive strength of the lower limbs. Functional Movement Screen (FMS) was used for functional assessment. Student's t-test was used to assess the relationship. The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to check the normality of the distribution, while the Spearman correlation coefficient was used to investigate the relationship between the obtained data. In order to illustrate the directions and size of mutual differentiation, the standardization index (WU) was used. Results. No significant differences were found in body height in the studied groups (WU = 0.65). The athletes were characterized by lower average body weight (-9.8 kg) WU = -1.7. The BMI index indicates a very large diversity of the studied groups. The training participants were characterized by lower average BF fat content (-6.1%). The assessment of parameters related to motor-speed motor skills indicates a large intergroup diversity in favor of the athletes in vertical jump height (WU = 1.68). Statistical analysis of other parameters, namely: power, force and vertical jump speed did not indicate significant intergroup differences. Taking into account the functional capabilities of the respondents, we conclude that the players did not differ significantly from their non-training counterparts (WU = 0.82). The results of tests of footballers and non-trainers in the parameters related to strength and speed capabilities did not confirm the relationship between the generated power of the lower limbs and the results of the functional capacity test. Conclusions. Footballers are characterized by a higher rebound height than those who do not train, but in the level of power and rebound strength and the climb speed do not differ significantly. Football training should include in the material and time structure measures influencing the formation of anaerobic abilities. No significant relationship was found between functional abilities and the skills involving strength and speed in players and non-exercisers.

One potential strategy to address these challenges is mindfulness training (MT). MT helps individuals take better care of themselves by understanding the mind-body connection and mobilizing inner resources for coping, healing, and thriving. Training in mindfulness (paying attention, on purpose, in the present moment, nonjudgmentally) can positively affect one's ability to reduce symptoms of psychological/physical distress. In four studies, we ask whether MT can be integrated into the normal routine of undergraduates and then assess its impact. Study One included participants (N=35; mean age 19.8) enrolled in one of two upper-level courses. As compared to the control class, weekly MT increased students' self-compassion F(1, 32) =4.79, p=.036, and decreased their self-criticism F(1, 32)=5.03, p=.032. Study Two showed that self-compassion training could be implemented in a first-year seminar (when students are particularly vulnerable to declines in well-being) (N=23; mean age 18.2). Data analyses revealed changes in the expected directions: Improved well-being, increased self-compassion, and decreased self-criticism. Study Three showed that a 15-wk MT program could be integrated into the practices/competitions of a collegiate soccer team (N=21). Athletes reported improvements in calmness and present-minded focus, and reductions in negative self-talk and distractions. Study Four integrated mindfulness practices into a Health Psychology curriculum that emphasized inclusion and cultural competency. As determined by independent, trained raters evaluating end-of-course essays, students (N=19) demonstrated proficiency in understanding and applying diverse perspectives to issues in health psychology, health promotion, and health disparities. These studies suggest that MT can be feasibly integrated into a college student's life with a positive impact. In none of these studies did we suggest to the students that they must practice. Instead, we attempted to make the practices as accessible as possible. Students could opt-out of any of the practices, but most tried to use mindfulness-based strategies in the context of their classroom or athletic endeavor.","2019","2020-05-20 00:37:06","2020-05-20 00:37:06","","A95","","4","81","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/PSY.0000000000000699; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L627783099","adult; conference abstract; female; human; male; soccer; clinical article; controlled study; training; competition; young adult; psychology; attention; health disparity; college student; health promotion; curriculum; mental stress; data analysis; distress syndrome; physical well-being; cultural competence; mindfulness","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Soreness and pain can be early indicators and risk factors for acute or long‐term injuries. Monitoring pain intensity and duration, as well as potential sources, are useful for planning practices and can be effective means for preventing injury. The aim of this study was to assess the areas and locations of pain in young soccer goalkeepers during a training camp, and to differentiate the area and frequency between pain arising from the muscles (MP), joints (JP), or as a result of an impact (IP). Recordings of the MP, JP, and IP location along with the area were performed using digital body mapping software (Navigate Pain Android app, Aalborg University, Denmark) installed on a tablet personal computer at the end of each training day across a 5‐day training camp. There was a significant difference in the area between the three types of pain (p < 0.001). The post hoc analysis revealed statistically significant differences between the pixel areas of IP versus JP (p < 0.001), IP versus MP (p < 0.001), and JP versus MP (p < 0.001). There was no significant time‐effect for the IP area between 1‐5 days of training (p = 0.610), neither for MP (p = 0.118) or JP (p = 0.797) and no significant difference for all three pain areas between the front and the back side of the body. The body regions most often reported for MP were thighs, while for JP they were groin and hips, and for IP the hips, shoulders, and forearms were most frequently indicated. This is the first study to map and report the pain distribution associated with training across a 5‐day training camp in soccer goalkeepers, and these findings emphasize the value of using digital pain drawings clinically as well as for monitoring the health status of soccer players.

Psychological components have especially attracted the attention of science and are finding their way into practice. This overview article aims to discuss five psychological issues in football which the authors consider to be among the most relevant for sport-psychological practitioners. Each topic is structured identically: (a) topic description, (b) empirical evidence highlighting its relevance in football and potential impacts on performance, and (c) practical recommendations. The first two topics focus on the environment in football by discussing (1) organisational issues and (2) player–coach–parent triads within football teams. Subsequently, the central theme performance is evaluated. (3) How do health and well-being impact long-term elite performance? (4) How can the training of psychological skills enhance performance? (5) How does ""choking under pressure"" affect performance? It can be stated that sport-psychological football research has provided several important and meaningful findings so far which can partly be adapted to practical settings. An even stronger focus of research in applied settings is warranted to gain further insights into the psychological underpinnings prevalent in the world of football. From a practical perspective, the article may provide both researchers and practitioners with valuable input on selected psychological topics in football. The summarised research can serve as a starting point for further research or interventions in practical settings.

Seventy academy practitioners working within Elite Player Performance Plan programs (Category 1: n = 29; Category 2: n = 13 and Category 3: n = 28) completed an online survey. Psychological factors were rated significantly (p ≤ 0.01) higher than sociological, technical/tactical, and physical factors, with recruitment staff specifically valuing psychological factors significantly (p ≤ 0.01) more than medical staff. Youth Development phase practitioners valued sociological factors significantly (p < 0.05) more than in the Foundation phase, which was also true for physical factors. Practitioners indicated significant positional differences for most physical and technical/tactical attributes. There was no playing position effect for relative age effect or maturity. Between playing position variance of outfield players for most technical and physical attributes increased according to advancing Elite Player Performance Plan phase. Attitudes to holistic talent identification criteria likely change according to practitioner role. Therefore, this study provides evidence to suggest that Elite Player Performance Plan practitioners place less perceived importance on enhanced maturity status and relative age of players but does indicate an enhancing and significant positional preference for physical and technical/tactical attributes. Suggesting that practitioners are less likely to (de)select players based on transient, maturity-related attributes and instead place greater emphasis on specialist physical/technical position-specific attributes as players navigate the Elite Player Performance Plan pathway towards professional status.

Rituals, usually conceived as superstitions, have survived among people. They comprise magical thinking, belief in specific sayings, ritualized behavior, specific interpretation of events. They are practiced to reduce anxiety. The purpose of the study was to identify the most common pre-competitive superstition rituals among Polish and Ukrainian football players and establish the relationship between superstitions and anxiety. Material and methods: Participants were 100 Polish and 50 Ukrainian adolescent football players. The Rituals in Sport and the Sport Anxiety Scale were used. Results: The results have shown that most common rituals used by football players are superstitions and elements of pre-performance routine. Athletes used religious and personal rituals to increase their selfconfidence. Some respondents exhibit ritualized behavior which might be considered as an element of pre-performance routine. Conclusions: The study found that as the level of pre-performance anxiety increased, the level of rituals also increased.

This study aimed to explore the association between pre-season assessments of 1) isometric hip adductor and abductor strength using a novel field-test; and 2) the Copenhagen Hip and Groin Outcome Score (HAGOS) and subsequent hip/groin injury in professional footballers. Methods: In total, n = 204 elite male footballers from ten professional Hyundai A-League and English Championship League clubs underwent assessments of hip adductor and abductor strength and completed the HAGOS in the 2017-18 pre-season. In-season hip/groin injuries reported by team medical staff. Data reduction was conducted using principal component analysis. The subsequent principal component for HAGOS, and three principal components for strength and imbalance measures, were entered with age into a multivariate logistic regression model to determine their association with prospectively occurring hip/groin injury. Results: Twenty-four players suffered at least one hip/groin injury throughout the 2017-18 competitive season. The principal component for between-limb abduction imbalance (peak strength in the preferred [kicking] limb – non-preferred limb) (OR = 0.61, 95 % CI = 0.40 to 0.92, p = 0.017), and the principal component for HAGOS (OR = 0.80, 95 % CI = 0.64 to 0.99, p = 0.040) were independently associated with a reduced risk of future hip/groin injury. Receiver operator curve analysis of the whole model revealed an area under the curve of 0.76. Discussion: In this cohort, having stronger hip abductors in the preferred (kicking) than non-preferred limb, and better HAGOS scores, was associated with a reduced likelihood of future hip/groin injury.","2019","2020-05-20 00:37:19","2020-05-20 00:37:19","","S60-S61","","","22","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsams.2019.08.259; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002914865","adult; conference abstract; football player; human; male; soccer player; hip; injury; controlled study; major clinical study; season; medical staff; inguinal region; abduction; area under the curve; principal component analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: Twenty-two players (age 23.3 ± 4.4 years) performed bench throw, one repetition maximum (1RM) bench press, squat jumps, three repetition maximum (3RM) squats, prone pull-ups and prone Yo-Yo intermittent recovery test level 1 (Yo-Yo IR1) before and after the 7-week preseason period. Training was classified into Gym, Field and Wrestle, with training load of each monitored using session rating of perceived exertion (sRPE) multiplied by training duration (sRPE-TL). Results: There were most likely improvements in 3RM back squat, prone pull-ups and Yo-Yo IR1 and likely improvements in the bench press, bench throw and squat jump after the 7-week training programme (ES = 0.3 to 1.2). Accumulated sRPE-TL for Gym, Field and Wrestle sessions were 9176 ± 1187, 10,906 ± 2162, and 1072 ± 315 AU, respectively. Relationships between mean weekly sRPE-TL and changes in physical qualities were trivial to large (r = −0.67 to 0.34).

There are often competing pressures within the professional football club leagues, for club physiotherapists, in which the demands for training and rehabilitation must balance with match performance. Seeking new ways to enhance footballer performance is an important area of study. One area that has received little attention is the development of the respiratory system with the emphasis on the development of inspiratory muscle function. This study aimed to investigate the effects a 6 week inspiratory muscle training programme on inspiratory muscle strength and perceptions of breathlessness in a group of elite football players. The purpose of the study was to evaluate and establish an effective inspiratory muscle training programme with the intention of developing a training protocol to enhance player match fitness. Methods: A quasi-experimental pre-test/post-test design was used to investigate the effectiveness of a standardised 6 week inspiratory muscle training programme using the POWERbreathe inspiratory resistance training device. Thirty three elite male footballers between the ages of 18–34 were recruited through convenience sampling. Participants were eligible if they were healthy, elite footballers that were contracted with a league 1 football club. Changes in maximum inspiratory pressure pre and post intervention were measured using MicroRPM. Each participant underwent a 6 week inspiratory muscle training programme which consisted of 30 resisted inspiratory breathes, twice a day, 3 to 4 times a week, progressing from 40 to 60 percent of individuals maximum inspiratory pressure values, obtained during the testing phase. Average ratings of perceived exertion scores, during the testing phase, were collected from all participants. Maximum inspiratory pressure was recorded to establish the change in force-generating capacity of the inspiratory muscles. Perceived exertion scores were collected to measure, indirectly, cardiovascular and respiratory system changes. Results: The Mean difference in maximum inspiratory pressure between pre-test and post pre-test conditions gave a positive difference of 20.42 cmH2O (SD. 16.5). A significant difference was detected for maximum inspiratory pressure at p = 0.0005. Ratings of perceived exertion also increased with a mean change of 0.72 rating (SD 1.8) with a significant difference detected at p = 0.032. Effect sizes were calculated and the change of maximum inspiratory pressure was deemed to be an intermediate effect (0.583) and the same for perceptions of exertion (0.629). Conclusion(s): The results of this study demonstrated that an inspiratory muscle training programme improved inspiratory muscle function in elite footballers. However, this was accompanied with an increase on ratings of perceived exertion. Further research is required to evaluate the impacts long-term and on match performance and to establish the relationship with ratings of perceived breathlessness and changes in the force generating capacity of respiratory muscles. Implications: A protocol for developing inspiratory muscle strength, using a Powerbreathe device with 30 resisted breaths, twice a day, 3 to 4 times a week, may have small to moderate impacts on respiratory system fitness. This type of training is easy to apply and should be integrated into standard football training programmes. Funding acknowledgements: A device known as the MicroRPM was used to obtain participants’ pre and post maximum inspiratory pressure values; this device was supplied by Coventry University. The inspiratory resistance training device, known as the POWERbreathe, was used throughout the 6 week training programme and was supplied by Coventry City Football Club.","2019","2020-05-20 00:37:25","2020-05-20 00:37:25","","e121-e122","","","105","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physio.2018.11.108; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2001385047","adult; conference abstract; football player; human; male; controlled study; resistance training; muscle function; attention; perception; muscle strength; effect size; dyspnea; heart ventricle remodeling; pretest posttest design; breathing muscle; maximal inspiratory pressure; funding; convenience sample; airway pressure meter","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While investigations conducted in rugby players on the effects of a morning preconditioning session already exist, additional work is warranted. The aim of this study was to monitor changes in physical and psychophysiological indicators among international Rugby-7s players following a priming exercise. METHODS: In a randomized crossover-design, fourteen under-18 international Rugby-7s players completed, at 8:00am, a preconditioning session consisting of a warm-up followed by small-sided games, accelerations and 2 x 50-m maximal sprints (Experimental) or no pre-loading session (Control). Following a 2-hour break, the players performed a set of six 30-m sprints and a Rugby-7s match. Recovery-stress state and salivary stress-markers levels were assessed before the preloading session (Pre), immediately after (Post-1), before the testing session (Post-2) and after (Post-3). RESULTS: Experimental-Control differences in performance across a repeated sprint test consisting of six 30-m sprints were very likely trivial (+0.2 ±0.7%, 3/97/1%). During the match, the total distance covered and the frequency of decelerations were possibly lower (small) in Experimental compared to Control. Differences observed in the other parameters were unclear or possibly trivial. At Post-2, the perceived recovery-stress state was improved (small difference) in Experimental compared with Control. No difference in salivary cortisol response was observed while the preconditioning session induced a higher stimulation of salivary testosterone and alpha-amylase. CONCLUSIONS: The players' ability to repeat sprints and physical activity in match-play did not improve but their psychophysiological state was positively affected after the present pre-conditioning session.","2019","2020-05-20 00:37:28","2020-05-20 00:37:28","","918-926","","7","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1123/ijspp.2018-0505; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629153676","human; male; football; exercise; adolescent; physiology; warm up; athletic performance; competitive behavior; testosterone; hydrocortisone; chemistry; saliva; amylase","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper simultaneously evaluates the external load (EL) and internal load (IL) for different time frames in combination with presession wellness to predict future perceived wellness using machine learning techniques. METHODS: Training and match data were collected from a professional soccer team. The EL was measured using global positioning system technology and accelerometry. The IL was obtained using the rating of perceived exertion multiplied by duration. Predictive models were constructed using gradient-boosted regression trees (GBRT) and one naive baseline method. The individual predictions of future wellness items (ie, fatigue, sleep quality, general muscle soreness, stress levels, and mood) were based on a set of EL and IL indicators in combination with presession wellness. The EL and IL were computed for acute and cumulative time frames. The GBRT model's performance on predicting the reported future wellness was compared with the naive baseline's performance by means of absolute prediction error and effect size. RESULTS: The GBRT model outperformed the baseline for the wellness items such as fatigue, general muscle soreness, stress levels, and mood. In addition, only the combination of EL, IL, and presession perceived wellness resulted in nontrivial effects for predicting future wellness. Including the cumulative load did not improve the predictive performances. CONCLUSIONS: The findings may indicate the importance of including both acute load and presession perceived wellness in a broad monitoring approach in professional soccer.","2019","2020-05-20 00:37:32","2020-05-20 00:37:32","","1074-1080","","8","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1123/ijspp.2017-0864; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629224225","adult; human; male; soccer; exercise; accelerometry; athlete; young adult; geographic information system; fatigue; forecasting; machine learning; myalgia; sleep; mental stress; health status; theoretical model; affect","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The data consisted of the situational variables and performance indicators of the matches in the English Premier League for the 2017–2018 season. One-way ANOVA, Tukey HSD, k-means clustering and decision tree approaches were implemented in the analyses. Scoring first was found as the most influential on match outcome in each decision tree, while the effects of clearances, shots, shots on target, possession percentage and match location on the match outcome varied according to the quality of opponent. An average of 2.43, 0.53 and 0.97 goals were scored by the teams that won, lost and drawn, respectively and teams that scored first won 67% of the matches. The decision trees based on the quality of opponent correctly predicted 67.9, 73.9 and 78.4% of the results in the games played against balanced, stronger and weaker opponents, respectively, while in all games (regardless of the quality of opponent) this rate is only 64.8%, implying the importance of considering the quality of opponent in the analyses. Coaches and managers can use these findings to create targets for players and teams during training and matches, and also can be prepared for these different competitive scenarios.

The aim of this study was to investigate and evaluate the current status of medical personnel, facilities, and equipment in Rugby Union clubs at regional level in England. Methods: A nationwide cross-sectional survey of 242 registered clubs was undertaken, where clubs were surveyed online on their current medical personnel, facilities, and equipment provision, according to regulation 9 of the Rugby Football Union (RFU). Results: Overall, 91 (45. 04%) surveys were returned from the successfully contacted recipients. Of the completed responses, only 23.61% (n = 17) were found to be compliant with regulations. Furthermore, 30.56% (n = 22) of clubs were unsure if their medical personnel had required qualifications; thus, compliance could not be determined. There was a significant correlation (p = −0.029, r = 0.295) between club level and numbers of practitioners. There was no significant correlation indicated between the number of practitioners/number of teams and number of practitioners/number of players. There were significant correlations found between club level and equipment score (p = 0.003, r = −0.410), club level and automated external defibrillator (AED) access (p = 0.002, r = −0.352) and practitioner level and AED access (p = 0.0001, r = 0.404).

Design: Descriptive statistics and post-play interviews. Setting: We completed procedures at one Mid-western University. Participants (or Animals, Specimens, Cadavers): Thirteen volunteer collegiate varsity offensive or defensive linemen. We recruited participants through multiple means and obtained IRB approval. Interventions: N/A. Main Outcome Measure(s): We measured the number, intensity, and location of hits sustained via the Riddell® Insite Helmet Sensor. Athletes completed interviews post-games or practices to document symptoms. Results: Over the course of one season, 13 athletes sustained 2,089 head impacts. Offensive (n = 7) and defensive linemen (n = 6) sustained 775 (M = 111; SD = 59.90) and 1,314 (M = 219; SD = 161.81) head hits respectively. The majority of hits were to the frontal (n = 1,740), top (n = 113) and right (n = 103) regions of the head. Of the total number of head hits recorded, 53 were of high (95thpercentile) and 24 were of severe (99thpercentile) intensity. Of the hits sustained, 29 occurred during games and 48 occurred during practices. During post-play one-on-one interviews with the researchers, three participants reported persistent headache, two reported difficulty concentrating, and one reported dizziness. However, none of the participants reported concussion-like symptoms to athletic or medical personnel during or post-play. Conclusions: Even though some athletes experience high intensity hits and/or symptoms post-activity, none were reported to medical personnel.

Dynamic balance screening should be performed in order to identify athletes at risk. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the preseason dynamic balance performance and side-to-side asymmetry of healthy elite male soccer players, using modified Star Excursion Balance Test (mSEBT). Seventy-three elite soccer players (23.8 ± 5.4 years) were evaluated using the mSEBT. Normalized reach distances, side-to-side asymmetries, and composite scores were determined. The composite scores were 93.33% ± 8.99% for dominant leg and 93.36% ± 9.23% for nondominant leg. No significant differences were found between dominant and nondominant limb in any direction. The mSEBT is an easy-to-use tool to measure the dynamic balance performance in elite athletes. It can be applied successfully during preseason physical examinations. Future studies are needed to establish predictive cutoff points in order to increase mSEBT use in screening soccer players for dynamic balance abnormalities and identify those at risk for noncontact lower limb injuries.","2019","2020-05-20 00:37:49","2020-05-20 00:37:49","","1557988319831920","","1","13","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1557988319831920; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L626440297","adult; human; male; soccer; athlete; physiology; cross-sectional study; procedures; body equilibrium; mass screening; Romania","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2019-This study aimed to examine the incidence of injuries and their characteristics among professional Spanish futsal players during the preseason period and to compare injury-related variables in the context of both competition and training. Eleven futsal teams belonging to the First and Second Spanish Division and 161 players participated in the study. Characteristics of injuries, including type, location, cause and time of injury, injury recurrence, and duration of absence, were recorded. A total of 62 injuries were reported; injury rates of 9.9 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 7.0-12.5) injuries/1,000 training hours and 61.1 (95% CI: 25.7-96.5) injuries/1,000 match hours were collected. These data indicate a mean of 5.64 ± 2.66 injuries per team during the preseason period. Of these injuries, 92.1% involved the lower limbs. When data from training and competition were analyzed together, the highest incidence of injuries affected the ankle (21%), followed by the hip/groin and knee (19.4% each). The most common type of injury was muscle rupture/tear/strain (29.0%). During training, the highest percentage of injuries were located in the knee (23.9%), followed by the ankle and hip/groin (21.7% in each case), while during matches, the thigh (35.7%) followed by the ankle (21.4%) was the regions most affected. A significant relationship (p = 0.008) was observed between injury cause (without contact, with other player, with the ball, and others) and injury context (training, match). To conclude, the results of this study suggest the need for injury prevention protocols focuses on the ankle and the knee joints and muscle strain prevention.","2019","2020-05-20 00:37:51","2020-05-20 00:37:51","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1519/JSC.0000000000003419; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L630493380","human; article; hip; knee; rupture; thigh; controlled study; incidence; major clinical study; competition; inguinal region; ankle; accident prevention; prevention; muscle strain; relapse","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A sociological analysis of professional football managers' behaviour towards injured players","Soccer & Society","","14660970","","","Drawing upon figurational sociology, this paper examines professional football managers' attitudes towards injured players. Following interviews with 10 managers, as with previous research, we found that managers have an expectancy that players are rarely fully fit. Players were stigmatized when they were seemingly unwilling to play when a manager encouraged them to. However, we also found that many managers shaped, in part, by their habitus formed from their own experiences as a player, showed greater empathy towards injured players. Many claimed they would not risk the long-term health of players, although at times, managers at the lower levels felt more constrained to take certain risks. We argue this is an unintended outcome of the increasing pressures on managers to succeed with smaller squads. The increasing emphasis and reliance on 'sport science' enabled managers at the higher levels to have a more supportive approach to managing injuries not previously identified in existing literature.

The aim of the present study was to examine the prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency in youth Russian soccer players and the efficacy of its treatment. Participants were 131 young male football players (age 15.6 ± 2.4 years). Low vitamin D levels (below 30 ng/mL) were observed in 42.8% of the analyzed participants. These athletes were split in two groups composed of persons with vitamin D deficiency (serum vitamin D below 21 ng/mL) and insufficiency (serum vitamin D in range of 21-29 ng/mL). A dietary supplement of 5000 IU cholecalciferol per day was administered for two months. After the treatment, an average 92% increase in vitamin D concentration was observed (before treatment—19.7 ± 5.4 ng/mL, after treatment—34.7 ± 8.6 ng/mL, p < 0.001) and 74% of the post-treatment values were within the reference range (30-60 ng/mL). Serum concentration of vitamin D increased by 200% ± 98% (p < 0.001) during the first month of treatment with vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency being successfully treated in 83% of the football players. In summary, the prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency was high in young Russian soccer players. Furthermore, it was indicated that the daily usage of cholecalciferol in a dose 5000 IU was an effective and well-tolerated treatment for vitamin D insufficiency. No linear dependency between the duration of treatment and increase in vitamin 25(OH) D concentration was observed.","2019","2020-05-20 00:38:05","2020-05-20 00:38:05","","","","10","11","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu11102405; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002777126","adult; football player; human; human experiment; male; article; soccer player; adolescent; athlete; body mass; child; prevalence; normal human; muscle mass; dietary supplement; anthropometry; body fat; vitamin supplementation; vitamin D; vitamin blood level; immunoassay; colecalciferol; vitamin D deficiency; winter","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Hypothesis: A high percentage of professional soccer players will have asymptomatic intra-articular changes of the knee. Study Design: Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: The condition of the intra-articular structures (osteophytes, cartilage, and menisci) in 94 knee joints of 47 adult professional soccer players (mean ± SD age, 25.7 ± 4.6 years; body mass index, 22.8 ± 1.4 kg/m2) was analyzed. A 1.5-T magnetic resonance imaging scanner was used to perform the imaging, and the anonymized data were analyzed by 2 experienced radiologists. Results: Cartilage of both knee joints was affected in 97.9% of soccer players. Meniscal lesions were detected in 97.8% of joints, affecting both joints in 93.6% of athletes. Grade 2 cartilage lesions were the most prevalent (36%-60% depending on the lesion site), and grade 4 lesions were detected in 12.7% of joints. The medial femoral condyle and medial tibial plateau were most frequently affected by cartilage lesions (85.1%). Among meniscal lesions, grade 2 lesions were the most prevalent, being detected in 71% of the cases. Grade 3 lesions were detected in 13.8% of the joints. The posterior horn of the lateral meniscus was the most common site of meniscal lesions (affected in 95.7% of the joints). Osteophytes were detected in 4.2% of joints. Conclusion: The prevalence of asymptomatic cartilage and meniscal lesions in the knees of adult professional soccer players is extremely high and is not associated with the reduction of sports involvement. This research should promote the correct interpretation of magnetic resonance imaging data obtained from soccer players with acute trauma and the reduction of the number of unwarranted surgical procedures.","2019","2020-05-20 00:38:07","2020-05-20 00:38:07","","","","11","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2325967119885370; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2003753257","adult; human; male; article; soccer player; knee; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; clinical article; priority journal; body mass; cohort analysis; young adult; cross-sectional study; prevalence; knee meniscus rupture; professional athlete; surgical technique; synovitis; cartilage; femoral condyle; image analysis; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; asymptomatic disease; knee meniscus; bone marrow edema; articular cartilage; medial tibial plateau; osteophyte","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Objective: To describe the prevalence of the main intrinsic risk factors for HSI in professional and under-20 football players. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Physiotherapy laboratory, Federal University of Health Sciences of Porto Alegre (Brazil). Participants: A total of 101 football players (52 professional and 49 under-20 players). Intervention: An evidence-based testing protocol for screening HSI risk factors. Main Outcome Measures: Anamnesis, ultrasonography of the hamstrings, passive straight-leg raise test, Functional Movement Screen, and isokinetic dynamometry were performed. Eleven HSI risk factors for each leg were assessed, besides the player's age as a systemic risk factor. Reports were delivered to the coaching staff. Results: Professionals had greater prevalence of HSI history compared with under-20 players (40% vs 18%). No between-group differences were found for the other screening tests. Altogether, 30% of players had already sustained at least one HSI; 58% had a history of injuries in adjacent regions; 49% had short biceps femoris fascicles; 66% and 21% had poor passive and active flexibility, respectively; 42% and 29% had deficits in functional movements and core stability, respectively; 7% and 26% presented bilateral imbalance for hamstring concentric and eccentric strength, respectively; 87% and 94% obtained low values for hamstring-to-quadriceps conventional and functional ratios, respectively. Two-thirds of players had 3 to 5 risk factors per leg. None of the players was fully free of HSI risk factors. Conclusion: Most football players present multiple risk factors for sustaining an HSI. Hamstring weakness is the most prevalent risk factor, but the teams should also be aware of deficits in flexibility, core stability, functional movements, and hamstring fascicle length.","2019","2020-05-20 00:38:11","2020-05-20 00:38:11","","1-7","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1123/jsr.2018-0084; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628326035","adult; football player; human; male; article; soccer player; controlled study; risk assessment; Brazil; outcome assessment; cross-sectional study; prevalence; echography; physiotherapy; risk factor; muscle injury; accident prevention; dynamometry; biceps femoris muscle; quadriceps femoris muscle; weakness; staff; screening test; anamnesis; health science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, knowing the aetiology and incidence of injuries may be useful not only for the treatment, but especially to help sports professionals to develop strategies or mechanisms of prevention while aiming to maintain the physical integrity of the athletes. Purpose. The aim of the study was to verify the prevalence of injury among American football players from the Santa Catarina state of Brazil. Methods. The total of 140 athletes were evaluated in the study with the use of an online questionnaire. Descriptive logistic regression and t-test analysis were applied (p < 0.05). Results. A high injury prevalence (74%) in the evaluated athletes was observed. Most of these injuries occurred during training (56%) and by direct contact between players (64%). Shoulders, knees, and hand/fingers were the most commonly injured body parts (14%, 13%, 12%, respectively). The most frequent types of injuries were those related to joints (46%) and muscles (39%), and very few concussions were reported. We found a significant positive association showing that the athletes that performed a conditioning program presented higher injury prevalence (p = 0.01). Conclusions. American football players of the Santa Catarina state are affected by high injury prevalence. The training characteristics, in general, do not seem to be associated with injury prevalence. Thus, aiming to reduce the exposure to injuries, we recommend for coaches and trainers to monitor the total volume of training and participation in matches.

Thus, the aim of the present study was to examine the prevalence of RAE in children and adolescent soccer players, as well as the role of age and performance. Russian soccer players (n = 10,446) of various ages, playing positions and performance levels were examined for their date of birth. It was observed that RAE was widespread in Russian soccer teams of all age groups. RAE was most pronounced in children teams of the top tier Russian soccer academies and junior Russia national teams, where the proportions of soccer players born in the first quarter were 43.9% and 39.8%, respectively, whereas those born in the fourth quarter of the year were 7.7% and 6.3%, respectively. In top tier soccer academies, RAE did not vary by age group. In the middle tier soccer academies, RAE was less pronounced. It was still prevalent in the junior teams of the top tier clubs of the Russian Premier League, where 14.3% of the soccer players were born in the fourth quarter of the year compared to 42.9% born in the first quarter of the year. RAE can be observed in the top tier Russian adult teams as well, although it is less pronounced there. In summary, RAE is highly prevalent in Russian children and junior soccer and is associated with the level of competitiveness. At the same time, the proportion of players born in the fourth quarter of the year is higher in adult teams than in junior and youth teams, which is most likely due to the wider selection of players, not limited by their age and place of residence. In junior teams, RAE results in a bias towards selection of players who are more physically mature, whereas children who may be more talented but are less developed due to their younger chronological age tend to be overlooked.","2019","2020-05-20 00:38:16","2020-05-20 00:38:16","","","","21","16","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph16214055; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002847699","adult; female; human; male; article; football; soccer player; major clinical study; competition; adolescent; juvenile; child; prevalence; groups by age; Russian (citizen)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Male team sports players are usually excluded from the population at risk of developing EDs. This exemption can be questioned based on previous studies identifying a great body concern inmale team athletes along with a generalized increase of extreme concern about body image and the sport-thinness relation. The current study aimed to detect EDs symptoms and risk factors for its development in male team sports players. A descriptiveanalytical study was carried out with 49 male adult semi-professional team sports players (age 25.6 ± 4.5 y, body weight 80.8 ± 11.4 Kg, height 1.8 ± 7.7 m, BMI 24.2 ± 2.5). Data was collected through a general assessment sheet along with the Eating Habits Questionnaire for Athletes to assess the concern for body weight, body shape and food intake by factors related to sports (CHAD), the Test of Food Attitudes to detect the symptoms of anorexia nervosa (EAT-40), the Inventory of EatingDisorders to contemplate cognitive-behavioral characteristics of EDs (EDI-2), and the Questionnaire on the Body Shape to evaluate attitudinal alterations about the body image (BSQ; Avila et al., 1996). Subjects were grouped based on their age, BMI, sports modality, playing position, training load, sports casualties and perceived pressure level. All data were analyzed with a Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Student's t,ANOVAand Pearson correlation. It was observed that 14% of the subjects presented symptoms of EDs. Positive correlation was observed between BMI and the CHAD score (p = 0.04) and between BMI and the BSQ score (p = 0.02). CHAD (p = 0.00), EAT-40 (p = 0.03), EDI-2 (p = 0.01) and BSQ (p = 0.03) were correlated positively with the weekly training load. Soccer players and rugby players were found to score significantly higher than basketball players on the EAT-40 (p = 0.04, p = 0.07 respectively) and CHAD (p = 0.12, p = 0.08, respectively). In conclusion, male sports team players could also be a group of risk for EDs development, being soccer and rugby the sport with greater risk. In addition, it seems that the risk for EDs is greater when BMI or training load are greater.","2019","2020-05-20 00:38:18","2020-05-20 00:38:18","","3","","","29","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1123/ijsnem.2019-0057; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628159697","adult; conference abstract; human; male; rugby; soccer player; controlled study; team sport; body mass; food intake; questionnaire; body weight; height; prevalence; risk factor; basketball player; underweight; accident; death; student; body image; body build; anorexia nervosa; eating habit; Y chromatin","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the general population the most common sleep disorders are obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), insomnia, and restless legs syndrome.They are associated with many adverse short and long-term health consequences. Despite the potential for sleep disorders to negatively affect athletic performance there is very little information in the sports science and medicine literature on the prevalence of sleep disorders in elite athletes.The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of sleep disorders in an elite rugby union team using in-laboratory polysomnography (PSG) and sleep questionnaires. Materials and methods: Twenty-five elite rugby union players underwent a night of PSG during the “off season” of the Super Rugby competition. Of interest were measurements that detected the presence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA; apnea hypopnea index >5 events/hr) and the presence of moderate-severe periodic leg movements during sleep (PLMs; >15 events/hr). Players also completed sleep-related questionnaires to assess daytime sleepiness, perception of insomnia, risk of OSA, and the presence of restless legs syndrome (RLS) as well as undergoing basic anthropometric assessments including body mass index and neck circumference. Results: OSA was present in 24% (n=6) of players and PLMs>15 events/hr in 12% (n=3). Questionnaire responses showed that all players had insomnia defined subthreshold insomnia and excessive daytime sleepiness, two players were identified as being at risk for OSA and none were classified as having RLS. Conclusions: This study has shown that sleep disorders and excessive daytime sleepiness are common in elite rugby union players. These findings indicate the need for a more proactive approach in the management of sleep and its disorders in professional rugby union. Such a process, whereby sleep disorders and poor sleep habits are identified, diagnosed, and managed could serve to optimise the players physical recovery and athletic performance. In addition, it can safeguard the long-term health of players, since sleep disruptions have been associated with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, cancer, and early mortality.

The aim of this study was to analyze the prevalence of musculoskeletal injuries in sports and the relationship with associated factors among college athletes. Methods: The population was composed of 529 college athletes (23.3 ± 3.1 years), men (n = 242) and women (n = 287), all competing in the Brazilian University Games (JUBs) - 2017, in Goiânia-GO. The Sports Injury Questionnaire (LAPREV/UFMG) was used to survey musculoskeletal injuries suffered in the last 12 months. The evaluation of the associated factors such as Overtraining syndrome and sociodemographic variables was made through the Clinical Symptoms Questionnaire of Overtraining (French Society of Sports Medicine, Brazilian Version), and a self-administered questionnaire, respectively. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS, version 20,0 for Windows. Results and Discussion: The results showed that among the university athletes there was a high prevalence of musculoskeletal injuries suffered in the last 12 months (59.5%), with Judo (84.4%) and Taekwondo getting higher prevalence among individual modalities and Basketball (68.3%) and Futsal (62.5%) among collective modalities. Conclusion: Having started early in the sport and having a long time of practice of the same modality were associated factors with the greater amount of musculoskeletal injuries suffered in the 12 months that preceded the JUBs.

Injury surveillance was prospectively employed to capture all the HSI occurring in the 2013/2014 season. There were 18 HSIs. Injury distribution was 55.6% dominant leg and 44.4% non-dominant leg. The model generated by the SmooteBoostM1 technique with a cost-sensitive ADTree as the base classifier reported the best evaluation criteria (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve score=0.837, true positive rate=77.8%, true negative rate=83.8%) and hence was considered the best for predicting HSI. The prediction model showed moderate to high accuracy for identifying professional soccer players at risk of HSI during pre-season screenings.

Additionally, it has the highest recurrence rate. A recent systematic review on risk factors for recurrence of HSI has reported previous ipsilateral anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) with hamstring tendon autografts as one of the predictors. Moreover, ACLR results in muscle imbalances, neuromuscular control decease, and activation of extracellular tissue remodeling. Consequently, it may cause prolonged mechanical stress on derived tendon site and its surroundings. High loading on fibrous tissue may lead to stiffening of its components. Stiffer tissues alter force transmission and muscle function which may promote re-injury of HSI. We hypothesize that mechanical loading demands exerted on the hamstring region affected by derivation of autograph may cause stiffer tissue components there. The aim to this study was to investigate stiffness of hamstring muscle and surrounding fascial tissue on autograft-derived side comparing with contralateral side. Methods: Two male professional rugby players who has a history of ACLR with hamstring tendon autograft, and subsequent HSI injury were recruited. Patient 1, (age/height/weight/years of experience, 32/186 cm/103 kg/17 years) who had multiple left biceps femoris strains; Patient 2, (age/height/weight/years of experience, 29/178 cm/98 kg/15 years) who had a single right biceps femoris strain. MRI was used to confirm and locate the HSI. While participants were lying in prone position, shear wave elastography (Axiplorer; SuperSonic Imagine, Axien-Provence, France) was performed to measure shear modulus (kPa) of muscle and surrounding fascial tissue. All measurements were taken at rest three times on the affected area and the corresponding area on the other leg. The difference between stiffness was analyzed using T-Test. Results: Patient 1: mean stiffness on injured muscle/ fascial tissue (10.6 kPa/16.5 kPa), uninjured side (6.0 kPa/ 7.1 kPa), percentage differences between injured side and uninjured side (76.67 %,132.39 %); Patient 2: mean stiffness on injured muscle/ fascial tissue (35.8 kPa/28.7 kPa), uninjured side (26.4 kPa/ 22.9 kPa), percentage differences between injured side and uninjured side (35.61 %, 25.33 %); p <.01. Discussion: Our study shows that previous ACLR with hamstring tendon autografts increases stiffness of muscle as well as surrounding fascial tissue. Therefore, we suggest that rehabilitation after ACLR, should consider asymmetric stiffness of soft tissues in order to prevent HSI.","2019","2020-05-20 00:38:31","2020-05-20 00:38:31","","S90","","","22","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsams.2019.08.106; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002902022","adult; conference abstract; human; male; rugby; sport injury; hamstring tendon; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; controlled study; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; body weight; muscle function; soft tissue; prevention; biceps femoris muscle; tendon graft; neuromuscular function; prone position; rehabilitation; France; mechanical stress; muscle rigidity; shear wave elastography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of previous severe injury on bilateral ground reaction force asymmetries measured during a countermovement jump using a dual force platform. A total of 34 male professional soccer players (age 19 ± 2 years) were subdivided into two groups; previous severe injury (N = 17) or no severe injury (N = 17). Previously injured players showed significantly greater asymmetry in concentric phase variables (P < 0.05) with strong effect sizes (range = 0.99-1.35). These players also showed significantly elevated asymmetry in eccentric phase variables (P < 0.05) and medium to large effect sizes (range = 0.73-1.05), with the exception of eccentric deceleration impulse (P > 0.05; d = 0.33). There were no significant between-group differences in bilateral jump performance parameters (P > 0.05).

We explored the impact of within-team relationships on the outcome of competition between sports teams. Relations among teammates consist of two aspects: qualitative and quantitative. While quantitative aspects measure the number of times two teammates collaborated, qualitative aspects focus on 'prior shared success'; that is, whether teamwork succeeded or failed. We examined the association between qualitative team interactions and the probability of winning using historical records from professional sports-basketball in the National Basketball Association, football in the English Premier League, cricket in the Indian Premier League and baseball in Major League Baseball-and the multiplayer online battle game Defense of the Ancients 2.

Methods: Stakeholder meetings held between October 2017 and May 2018 included representatives from the four City professional sports clubs (football, rugby, basketball and cricket) and City employers. They requested Type 2 diabetes risk identification (screening) at their events. Trained staff from Leicester Diabetes Centre and the Centre for Black and Minority Health administered the Leicester Diabetes Risk Score (seven self-report questions). The validated scoring system assigns a low, medium, high and very high risk score to screeners. Events were promoted by the sports clubs (e.g. matchday programme, Twitter). Employee participation was supported by line managers. Results: Between May and October 2018, 303 adults completed a risk score and received their result at six events including a Leicester City FC Premier League game, a senior league football game, a test cricket match, a large call-centres and the City Council. Overall, 43% were at high or very high risk. The workplace gave the largest number of screeners (46%) and proportion of at risk people (44%).

The program adopted a problem-based approach to learning and linked new knowledge to students' specific coaching context. Each cohort functioned as a community of practice with coaches learning from each other through reflective practices. This study has shown that collaboration between a higher education institution and a national sport coaching organization can be productive in a blended (online-residential) environment. Using a professionalization lens, this paper discusses the need for university programs to focus on ethics in order to move the professionalization process along.

In light of this distinction, the researchers ask the clubs why they take part in QCP and what they want to get out of it. This paper also invites reflections on the more troublesome part of voluntary organizations' participation in processes of professionalization. Finally, we explore what the clubs understand to be the driving forces behind the programme and discuss whether these factors are conducive to the aims that the clubs have for their participation. Research Methods: The data comprise semi-structured interviews with 22 football clubs analysed by theme-based coding and categorization. Results and Findings: Clubs take part in QCP because they are expected to (i.e. institutionalization), to increase their autonomy and to improve their control over important resources: volunteers (i.e. resource dependency). To achieve this, the clubs see better routines, more predictability and improved structure as imperative. This study's results show that what clubs report as making the programme function does not always work in favour of the clubs' aims. Implications: The findings indicate that broad, multi-institutional approaches and action-oriented theories are necessary for understanding the choices and actions of voluntary sport clubs. Also shown is how the tools chosen for organizational development could be contrary to organizations' aims.

Cent dix-neuf sportifs professionnels ont été inclus. Trente pratiquaient le basketball (10 en Ligue A, 10 en Ligue B et 10 en National Ligue 1), vingt et un pratiquaient le handball (Ligue 1), 13 pratiquaient le volleyball (Ligue A), trente pratiquaient le cyclisme (Continental Pro Tour) et vingt-cinq pratiquaient le football (Ligue 1). L'âge des sportifs professionnels était de 26 ± 4 ans [18–38] pour une taille de 186 ± 13 cm [167–213] et un poids de 84 ± 14 Kg [63–120], soit un indice de masse corporelle (IMC) de 23,8 ± 1,9 kg/cm2 [19,2–28,6]. La force musculaire des genoux a été mesurée à l'aide d'un dynamomètre isocinétique CybexNorm® en début de saison sportive. La force maximale des quadriceps et ischio-jambiers a été rapportée au poids du corps pour les comparaisons. Les ratios conventionnels (Ischio-jambiers/Quadriceps) et bilatéraux (quadriceps/quadriceps et ischio-jambiers/ischio-jambiers) ont été calculés pour les vitesses angulaires de 60 et 180°/s. L'âge, la taille et le poids étaient différents en fonction des sports pratiqués. La vitesse angulaire de 180°/s a permis la meilleure identification des profils musculaires en fonction des sports pratiqués. La force relative des quadriceps des footballeurs était supérieure à celle des basketteurs, handballeurs et cyclistes. La force relative des ischio-jambiers des footballeurs était supérieure à celle des autres sports étudiés excepté les handballeurs. Les ratios conventionnels et bilatéraux n'étaient pas différents en fonction des sports pratiqués. Notre étude a permis de chiffrer et de comparer les caractéristiques anthropométriques ainsi que les valeurs isocinétiques des sportifs de haut niveau. Les footballeurs ont un profil isocinétique différent des autres sports, probablement en lien avec la spécificité de ce sport. Ces résultats pourront servir aux entraîneurs, aux kinésithérapeutes et aux médecins du sport qui encadrent les sports individuels et collectifs qui ont été étudiés. To determine and compare the knee isokinetic profiles in accordance with the high level practice of basketball, handball, volleyball, cycling or football. One hundred and nineteen professional athletes were included. Thirty practiced basketball (10 in A League, 10 in B League and 10 in First National League), twenty-one practiced handball (First League), thirteen practiced volleyball (A League), thirty practiced cycling (Continental Pro Tour) and twenty-five practiced soccer (First League). The age was 26 ± 4 years old [18–38] for 186 ± 13 cm height [167–213], 84 ± 14 kg weight [63–120], and 23.8 ± 1.9 kg/cm2 Body Mass Index [19.2–28.6]. The knee strength was measured using a CybexNorm® isokinetic dynamometer at the beginning of sport season. Quadriceps and hamstring maximal strength was reported to the body weight for comparison. The isokinetic conventional ratios (hamstring-to-quadriceps) and the bilateral (quadriceps-to-quadriceps and hamstring-to-hamstring) ratios were calculated for the 60 and 180°/s angular speed. Age, height and weight were different depending on the sports practiced. The 180°/s angular speed allowed a better identification of muscle profiles according to the sports practiced. The quadriceps relative strength of soccer players was greater than basketball, handball players and cyclist's ones. The hamstrings relative strength of soccer players was superior to the other sports except the handball players. The conventional and bilateral ratios were not different in accordance with the sport practice. Our study has quantified and compared the anthropometric characteristics and isokinetic values of high level athletes. Soccer players have an isokinetic profile different from other sports players, probably related to the specificity of this sport practice. These results can be used by coac es, physiotherapists and reference sports physicians in relation to the individual and collective sports that have been studied.

This study analyzed the prognostic relevance of motor tests for players' future selection level in female soccer and assessed the role of sex as a moderator variable. Methods: Within the German talent promotion program, N = 499 U12 girls participated in motor diagnostics (sprint, agility, dribbling, ball control, shooting). Five years later, 14.2% of them made the youth national team (NT), 18.8% the regional association team (RA), and 66.9% were not further selected (NS). The tests' predictive validity for achieving one of these levels was analyzed using ANOVAs with post-hoc tests and logistic regressions. Subsequently, results were compared to data from previous research with N = 22,843 male U12 players. Results: Girls' performances in the motor diagnostics significantly discriminated between all three selection levels. Future NT players outperformed NS (d = 1.04) and RA players (d = 0.55), who, in turn, performed better than NS players (d = 0.47). Exception for dribbling, the motor tests demonstrated predictive validity independent of sex. Discussion: Although diagnostics are not sensitive enough to determine individual decisions for talent selection, they provide objective information to supplement coaches' work.

According to the calendar of the competitions the competitive period of the first macrocycle within the three-cycle annual training process lasted 75 days. During this period 14 microcycles were conducted, two of them were competitive and three recovery-maintenance ones. It was established that non-specific (general preparatory) exercises in competitive microcycles comprised 28,1 to 38,6%, special preparatory exercises - from 6,7 to 11,5%, preliminaryexercises- from 21,5 to 38,6% and competitive exercises - from29,1 to 33,3%. In recovery-maintenance microcycles the largest share was received by the general preparatory exercises - 60,2%. 10,2% were allocated for special preparatory exercises, 29,6% of training hours for the preliminary exercises. Competitive exercises in these microcycles were not practised. It is determined that the average amount of load in the training sessions of the competitive macrocycles ranges from 482 to 1292 points and the intensity index of training sessions - from5,6 to 9,9 points·min-1. In recoverymaintenancemicrocycles these indicators are in the range from 264 to 505 points and from 3,9 to 5,6 points·min- 1. The training of qualifiedfootball players in the competitive periods of macrocycles should be heldaccording to the theory of periodization of sports training. An optimal methodical approach to the construction of the training process for qualifiedfootball players is programming.

Although proprioception is well studied in rehabilitation, little is known about the association between proprioception and the occurrence of sport injuries. The purpose of this study was to look into the association between ankle and knee proprioception and lower extremity injuries in young football players. 73 football players from the highest U-21 league in Iran volunteered to participate in this study. Before the start of the 2017-2018 competitive season, joint position sense was measured at 30°, 60° and 90° knee flexion and at 10° and 15° ankle dorsiflexion, and inversion using the Biodex Isokinetic pro 4 system. The teams' medical staff recorded football-related lower extremity injuries. We used mixed effects Cox regression models to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs, acknowledging the clustered data structure. 22 players (30.1%) suffered one or more lower extremity injuries during the season. None of the proprioception measures examined was significantly associated with the risk of lower extremity injuries. Based on these results of our sample, joint position sense does not seem to be associated with lower extremity injuries in young male football players.","2019","2020-05-20 00:38:53","2020-05-20 00:38:53","","1-20","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17461391.2019.1662492; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629200187","adult; football player; human; male; article; soccer; sport injury; clinical article; controlled study; season; medical staff; ankle; knee function; proprioception; accident prevention; leg injury; Iran","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The presenting complaints and symptoms vastly differ between patients with these 2 conditions, and a clear understanding of these differences can help guide effective treatment. Purpose: To compare a matched cohort of patients with anterior and posterior instability to clearly outline the differences in the initial presenting history and overall outcomes after arthroscopic stabilization. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: Consecutive patients with either anterior or posterior glenohumeral instability were prospectively enrolled; patients were excluded if they had more than 10% anterior or posterior glenoid bone loss, multidirectional instability, neurologic injury, or prior surgery. Patients were assigned to anterior or posterior shoulder instability groups based on the history and clinical examination documenting the primary direction of instability, with imaging findings to confirm a labral tear associated with the specific direction of instability. Preoperative demographic data, injury history, and overall clinical outcome scores (American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons [ASES], Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation [SANE], and Western Ontario Shoulder Index [WOSI]) were assessed and compared statistically between the 2 cohorts. Patients were indicated for surgery if they elected to proceed with surgical management or did not respond to a course of nonoperative management. Results: The study included 103 patients who underwent anterior stabilization (mean age, 23.5 years; range, 18-36 years) and 97 patients who underwent posterior stabilization (mean age, 24.5 years; range, 18-36 years). The mean follow-up was 39.7 months (range, 24-65 months), and there were no age or sex differences between the groups. No patients were lost to follow-up. The primary mechanism of injury in the anterior cohort was a formal dislocation event (82.5% [85/103], of which 46% [39/85] required reduction by a medical provider), followed by shoulder subluxation (12%, 12/103), and ""other"" (6%, 6/103; no forceful injury). No primary identifiable mechanism of injury was found in the posterior cohort for 78% (75/97) of patients; lifting and pressing (11%, 11/97) and contact injuries (10% [all football blocking], 10/97) were the common mechanisms that initiated symptoms. Only 10 patients (10.3%) in the posterior cohort sustained a dislocation. The most common complaints for patients with anterior instability were joint instability (80%) and pain with activities (32%). In the posterior cohort, the most common complaint was pain (90.7%); only 13.4% in this cohort reported instability as the primary complaint. Clinical outcomes after arthroscopic stabilization were significantly improved in both groups, but the anterior cohort had significantly better outcomes in all scores measured: ASES (preoperative: anterior 58.0, posterior 60.0; postoperative: anterior 94.2 vs posterior 87.7, P < .005), SANE (preoperative: anterior 50.0, posterior 60.0; postoperative: anterior 92.9 vs posterior 84.9, P < .005), and WOSI (preoperative: anterior 55.95, posterior 60.95; postoperative: anterior 92% of normal vs posterior 84%, P < .005). Conclusion: This study outlines clear distinctions between anterior and posterior shoulder instability in terms of presentation and clinical findings. Patients with anterior instability present primarily with an identifiable mechanism of injury and complaints of instability, whereas most patients with classic posterior instability have no identifiable mechanism of injury and their primary symptom is pain. Anterior instability outcomes in this matched cohort were superior in all domains versus posterior instability after arthroscopic stabilization, which further highlights the differences between anterior and posterior instability.

Current imaging techniques have not been able to identify early damage caused by mTBI that is predictive of long-term symptoms or chronic traumatic encephalopathy. In this preliminary feasibility study, the authors investigated the use of an emerging magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique, multicomponent driven equilibrium single pulse observation of T1 and T2(mcDESPOT), in visualizing acute and chronic white matter changes after mTBI in collegiate football and rugby players. METHODS This study was a nonrandomized, nonblinded prospective trial designed to quantify changes in the myelin water fraction (MWF), used as a surrogate MRI measure of myelin content, in a group of male collegiate football and rugby players, classified here as a contact sport player (CSP) cohort, at the time of mTBI diagnosis and 3 months after injury when the acute symptoms of the injury had resolved. In addition, differences in the MWF between the CSP cohort and a control cohort of noncontact sport players (NCSPs) were quantified. T-tests and a threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE) statistical analysis technique were used to identify brain structures with significant changes in the MWF between the CSP and NCSP cohorts and between immediately postinjury and follow-up images obtained in the CSP cohort. RESULTS Brain MR images of 12 right-handed male CSPs were analyzed and compared with brain images of 10 right-handed male NCSPs from the same institution. A comparison of CSP and NCSP baseline images using TFCE showed significantly higher MWFs in the bilateral basal ganglia, anterior and posterior corpora callosa, left corticospinal tract, and left anterior and superior temporal lobe (p < 0.05). At the 3-month follow-up examination, images from the CSP cohort still showed significantly higher MWFs than those identified on baseline images from the NCSP cohort in the bilateral basal ganglia, anterior and posterior corpora callosa, and left anterior temporal lobe, and also in the bilateral corticospinal tracts, parahippocampal gyrus, and bilateral juxtapositional (previously known as supplemental motor) areas (p < 0.05). In the CSP cohort, a t-test comparing the MWF at the time of injury and 3 months later showed a significant increase in the overall MWF at follow-up (p < 0.005). These increases were greatest in the bilateral basal ganglia and deep white matter. MWF decreases were seen in more superficial white matter (p < 0.005). CONCLUSIONS In this preliminary study, MWF was found to be increased in the brains of CSPs compared with the brains of controls, suggesting acute/chronic MWF alterations in CSPs from previous injuries. Increases in the MWF were also demonstrated in the brains of CSPs 3 months after the players sustained an mTBI. The full clinical significance of an increased MWF and whether this reflects axon neuropathology or disorderly remyelination leading to hypermyelination has yet to be determined.","2019","2020-05-20 00:38:56","2020-05-20 00:38:56","","1321-1329","","4","130","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.3171/2017.12.JNS171597; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2001869634","football player; human; male; article; rugby; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; brain concussion; clinical article; priority journal; controlled study; prospective study; athlete; follow up; white matter; traumatic brain injury; contact sport; image processing; neuroimaging; chronic traumatic encephalopathy; neuropathology; temporal lobe; pyramidal tract; corpus callosum; feasibility study; basal ganglion; myelin; myelin water fraction; parahippocampal gyrus; parameters; remyelinization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Pistachio nut, a rich source of potent antioxidants, can prevent OS by reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and by strengthening the antioxidant defense system. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the thiol/ disulfide homeostasis (TDH) parameters, a potent indicator of OS, to evaluate both the harmful effects of the strenuous soccer training program (STP) and the protective effects of pistachio nut against OS caused by a strenuous STP. Materials and methods: Forty male soccer players from two professional soccer teams and twenty-one healthy control male subjects of a similar age and body mass index who were not interested in any sports were enrolled in this study. Immediately after a three month resting period, the forty soccer players were randomly divided into a soccer player group (SPG) and an experimental group (EG). The players in the SPG underwent a twenty-one day strenuous STP only, and those in the EG underwent the same twenty-one day STP and received raw pistachio nut kernels (25 g/day) as a dietary supplement. A baseline venous blood sample was obtained from all participants, and a subsequent venous blood sample was obtained after the STP in only the STG and EG. Serum TDH parameters were measured using an automated technique. Results: No significant difference was observed in TDH parameters among SPG, EG, and control group before STP. Although TDH impaired significantly over time in the SPG (at baseline and after the twenty-one day STP), no significant alterations in the TDH parameters were observed over time in the EG. Conclusions: The results indicate that a strenuous STP may induce OS and that dietary supplementation with pistachio nuts may prevent this OS-associated damage in young soccer players.","2019","2020-05-20 00:38:59","2020-05-20 00:38:59","","893-897","","2","35","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.19193/0393-6384_2019_2_135; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2001755396","adult; human; male; article; soccer; soccer player; clinical article; exercise; controlled study; sport; body mass; blood sampling; randomized controlled trial; age; dietary supplement; oxidative stress; homeostasis; disulfide; drug blood level; drug effect; pistachio nut; thiol derivative","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Initial neuropathologic changes in CTE include perivascular deposition of phosphorylated microtubule-associated protein tau (p-tau) neurofibrillary tangles and other aggregates in neurons, astrocytes and cell processes in an irregular pattern often at the depths of the cortical sulci. In later stages, the p-tau depositions become widespread and is associated with neurodegeneration. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are known to carry neuropathogenic molecules, most notably p-tau. We therefore examined the protein composition of EVs isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of former National Football League (NFL) players with cognitive and neuropsychiatric dysfunction, and an age-matched control group (CTRL) with no history of contact sports or traumatic brain injury. EVs were isolated from the CSF samples using an affinity purification kit. Total tau (t-tau) and tau phosphorylated on threonine181 (p-tau181) in CSF-derived EVs from former NFL players and CTRL participants were measured by ultrasensitive immunoassay. The t-tau and p-tau181 levels of CSF-derived EV were positively correlated with the t-tau and p-tau181 levels of total CSF in former NFL players, respectively, but not in the CTRL group. 429 unique proteins were identified from CSF-derived EVs and quantified by TMT-10 plex method. The identified protein molecules were significantly enriched for the extracellular exosome molecules, Alzheimer’s disease pathway and Age/Telomere Length ontology as determined by DAVID Gene Ontology analysis. Ingenuity pathway analysis of the differentially expressed EV proteins revealed enrichment of canonical liver/retinoid X receptor activation pathway. Upstream effect analysis predicted MAPT (tau) as an upstream regulator in former NFL players. These data will be useful for understanding the EV-mediated disease spread and development of novel EV biomarkers for CTE and related disorders.","2019","2020-05-20 00:39:01","2020-05-20 00:39:01","","","","","13","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2019.01059; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629657664","adult; football player; human; male; article; clinical article; controlled study; risk; protein expression; chronic traumatic encephalopathy; tau protein; protein phosphorylation; protein analysis; exosome; liver X receptor; protein cerebrospinal fluid level; proteomics; retinoid X receptor; threonine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the current study, sport motivation, measured as the relative autonomy index, visuo-spatial working memory and selective attention aspects of executive function, measured as the computerized Corsi Block Tapping Test and Eriksen Flanker Test were assessed. Ten participants with ID and ten typical partners practiced soccer activities together for 50-min each session, twice a week for fifteen-week long. The whole practice sessions were monitored at moderate exercise intensity. Measures were tested at pre- and post- program. Our results indicated that the typical partners improved the performance in Corsi Block Tapping Test because partners needed to search and select participants with ID and targets simultaneously in a spatial field. The increased relative autonomy index was noted in participants with ID. They also improved response accuracy in Eriksen Flanker Test because they were requested to evaluate, analyze, and take the appropriate actions at all times during practice. Thus, the demanding of inclusive soccer activities might promote sport motivation in participants with ID and lead to different cognitive benefits in participants with ID and their partners respectively. Future research is needed to examine with a larger sample size. In addition, more cognitive and physiological measures should be applied to explore the underlying mechanisms among individuals with ID.","2019","2020-05-20 00:39:06","2020-05-20 00:39:06","","847-861","","6","31","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","","","","https://gateway.library.qut.edu.au/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=c8h&AN=139586253&site=ehost-live&scope=site","Adult; Clinical Assessment Tools; Soccer; Human; Motivation; Exercise Intensity; Attention; Intellectual Disability -- In Adulthood; Cognition; Memory; Psychology, Sports","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In a 20-month period, 111 academy football players aged 11-16 completed the Psychological Characteristics of Developing Excellence Questionnaire (PCDEQ) on 1-5 occasions. This combination of single and repeated assessments resulted in a mixed-longitudinal sample of 226 completed PCDEQs. Players were then prospectively tracked, and their scholarship status assessed at follow-up, at age U17. Multilevel modelling revealed that coping with performance and developmental pressures scores increased with age, and that Category 1-2 academy scholars (4.35 ± 0.61) scored higher than Category 3-4 academy scholars (3.99 ± 0.67) and non-scholars (4.02 ± 0.78) (p < .05). Evaluating performances and working on weaknesses scores increased with age for Category 1-2 academy scholars (U12-U14 vs. U15-U16 = 5.16 ± 0.48 vs. 5.38 ± 0.45), compared to non-scholars (U12-U14 vs. U15-U16 = 5.11 ± 0.59 vs. 5.03 ± 0.71) (p < .05). Imagery use during practice and competition scores decreased with age (U12-U14 vs. U15-U16 = 4.45 ± 0.66 vs. 4.29 ± 0.70) (p < .05). A blend of PCDEs may facilitate optimal career progression.

The aim was to determine differences in the sport psychological skill levels of African junior soccer players of different maturation levels. Male football players (N = 149) with a mean age of 16.24 ± 1.10 years participated in this study. Based on a synthesis of previous research a biological maturation questionnaire was used to classify the participants as EDs (n = 27), ADs (n = 77), and LDs (n = 45). The Athletic Coping Skills Inventory-28 was used to measure their sport psychological skills. The LDs had significantly higher coping with adversity (p = .032, d = 0.35), as well as goal setting and mental preparation (p = . 014, d = 0.76) scores than the EDs. Psychological factors could potentially have counterbalanced some of the physical disadvantages of late maturation. Coaches, selectors and talent scouts should be careful not to exclude later maturing soccer players from talent development programmes.

There were 49 women aged between 19 and 32 years old (M = 22.82) and 56 men aged between 18 and 31 years old (M = 21.54) participating in the study. In order to determine psychological genders, we used IPP (Inwentarz do Oceny Płci Psychologicznej) by Kuczyńska. Pearson's chi² test showed that in the group of women who play team sports, androgynous psychological gender is the most popular (63.27%). For men who play team sports the most common were: sex-typed (44.64%) and androgynous psychological gender (35.71%).

However, until recently there has been little empirical research conducted in this domain. To address this gap in the literature, fourteen professional male athletes from Australian Rules football, rugby league, rugby union and soccer participated in semi-structured interviews designed to identify the factors within their ivorkplace that they believed impacted on their psychological wellbeing. The participants also provided their perceptions of how athletes typically manage and respond to these factors. Results revealed that high levels of performance pressure, public and media scrutiny, career insecurity and sustaining physical injuries were perceived to most impact on psychological wellbeing. Participants also reported using both healthy (e.g. effective communication skills, help seeking behaviour) and unhealthy (e.g. avoidance, denial, alcohol abuse) tendencies in response to the identified workplace adversity factors. Implications o f the study and directions for future research are discussed, including the development o f intervention programs designed specifically for professional athletes.

Unfortunately, these detailed data are owned by specialized companies and hence are rarely publicly available for scientific research. To fill this gap, this paper describes the largest open collection of soccer-logs ever released, containing all the spatio-temporal events (passes, shots, fouls, etc.) that occured during each match for an entire season of seven prominent soccer competitions. Each match event contains information about its position, time, outcome, player and characteristics. The nature of team sports like soccer, halfway between the abstraction of a game and the reality of complex social systems, combined with the unique size and composition of this dataset, provide an ideal ground for tackling a wide range of data science problems, including the measurement and evaluation of performance, both at individual and at collective level, and the determinants of success and failure.","2019","2020-05-20 00:39:15","2020-05-20 00:39:15","","236","","1","6","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629712616; http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41597-019-0247-7","human; article; soccer; season; team sport; competition; data science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Unfortunately, these methods of measurement are time-consuming, invasive, and costly. A quick noninvasive measurement tool is needed to aid studies of head injury and its biological impact. Quantitative pupillometry is a potential objective, rapid, noninvasive measurement tool that may be used to assess the neurological effects of HHIs. In this study, the authors investigated the effect of HHIs on pupillary metrics, as measured using a pupillometer, in the absence of a diagnosed concussion. METHODS: A prospective observational cohort study involving 18 high school football athletes was performed. These athletes were monitored for both the frequency and magnitude of head impacts that they sustained throughout a playing season by using the Head Impact Telemetry System. An HHI was defined as an impact exceeding 95g linear acceleration and 3760 rad/sec2 rotational acceleration. Pupillary assessments were performed at baseline, midseason, after occurrence of an HHI, and at the end of the season by using the NeurOptics NPi-200 pupillometer. The Sport Concussion Assessment Tool, 5th Edition (SCAT5), was also used at each time point. Comparisons of data obtained at the various time points were calculated using a repeated-measures analysis of variance and a t-test. RESULTS: Seven athletes sustained HHIs without a related diagnosed concussion. Following these HHIs, the athletes demonstrated decreases in pupil dilation velocity (mean difference 0.139 mm/sec; p = 0.048), percent change in pupil diameter (mean difference 3.643%; p = 0.002), and maximum constriction velocity (mean difference 0.744 mm/sec; p = 0.010), compared to measurements obtained at the athletes' own midseason evaluations. No significant changes occurred between the SCAT5 subtest scores calculated at midseason and those after a high impact, although the effect sizes (Cohen's d) on individual components ranged from 0.41 to 0.65. CONCLUSIONS: Measurable changes in pupil response were demonstrated following an HHI. These results suggest that clinically asymptomatic HHIs may affect brain reflex pathways, reflecting a biological injury previously seen when more invasive methods were applied.","2019","2020-05-20 00:39:17","2020-05-20 00:39:17","","1-6","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.3171/2019.7.JNS191272; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629993646","human; article; football; acceleration; prospective study; season; accelerometry; analysis of variance; athlete; cohort analysis; concussion; high school; effect size; quantitative analysis; reflex; axonal injury; chronic traumatic encephalopathy; telemetry; pupillometer; pupillometry; signal transduction; protein kinase p60; pediatrics; mydriasis; non invasive measurement","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

She reported that she braced herself for a tackle during a contact drill in practice when she experienced sharp pain near the left shoulder blade. She reported pain in the medial periscapular area with shoulder movement and deep inspiration. After initial negative imaging, she did trials of NSAIDs, muscle relaxants and tramadol as well as physical therapy, myofascial manual therapy, trigger point injections and chiropractic manipulation over the course of 6 months without significant improvement. The last 3 of those months, she was home in Canada for summer break. The athlete now returns to campus with continued pain. Physical Exam: Well appearing female. No obvious abnormalities or gross asymmetry of left back or shoulder. Slightly kyphotic posture. Cervical spine range of motion is full. No midline tenderness. Painful Spurling's, without radiation. Non-tender thoracic spine. Tenderness to the lower border of the upper trapezius, left rhomboid and levator scapulae. Mild deficit with shoulder flexion and abduction secondary to pain. Strength = 5/5. Non-painful AP and lateral compression of rib cage. Differential Diagnosis: Rhomboid spasm Scapular dyskinesis Thoracoscapular bursitis or snapping scapula Posterior rib fracture Thoracic transverse process fracture Test Results: T-Spine and Left Rib XR (April 2017) normal. T-Spine MRI (August 2017) Healing left posterior third rib fracture near transverse process. Vitamin D level = 66 ng/mL. CT Chest (December 2017) Partial nonunion of above fracture. (CT performed due to continued pain despite activity limitation). Bone Scan (March 2018) Small focus of radiotracer uptake over posterior left third rib. (Obtained to assess fracture healing). Follow up CT Chest (September 2018) Interval healing of the fracture. Final Diagnosis: Isolated fracture of the left posterior third rib. Discussion: Isolated posterior rib fractures immediately adjacent to the transverse process are unusual in the absence of high velocity trauma and other injuries. It is suspected that fracture healing was impaired by the combination of manipulation and an inability to immobilize the costotrans-verse joint. Other cases of isolated posterior rib fractures were not found in the literature to guide decision-making. Despite a normal vitamin D level, the athlete continued calcium and vitamin D supplements. A bone stimulator was used to facilitate fracture healing based on the success of stimulators in other fracture non-unions. The bone stimulator was used for = months, which likely played a role in healing. Outcome: The athlete was restricted from contact and heavy upper extremity lifting activities for 18 months due to recurrent pain with attempts to progress back to contact activities. Follow-up: After the significant period of rest, the athlete was able to slowly start back with modified upper body lifting without recurrence of pain. She does not plan to return to competitive rugby at this time.","2019","2020-05-20 00:39:19","2020-05-20 00:39:19","","e11-e12","","2","29","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/JSM.0000000000000728; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629860524","adult; conference abstract; female; human; rib fracture; rugby; case report; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; clinical article; athlete; young adult; follow up; decision making; summer; abduction; range of motion; cervical spine; physiotherapy; physical examination; pain; calcium; vitamin D; thoracic spine; diagnosis; differential diagnosis; tracer; compression; muscle spasm; Canada; body position; scapula; relapse; bone scintiscanning; dyskinesia; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; bone growth stimulator; bursitis; chiropractic manipulation; levator scapulae muscle; pseudarthrosis; rib cage; tramadol; transverse process; trapezius muscle; trigger point","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ten days prior to presentation he was hit in the right thigh by a football helmet. He was unable to practice the following week secondary to pain. One day prior to presentation, he attempted to return to practice. He felt immediate pain of the right thigh with sprinting and removed himself from play. Pain progressed that evening and he was evaluated at an emergency department. Radiographs of the right knee were negative and he was diagnosed with a quadriceps contusion. He was prescribed a muscle relaxant and instructed to take ibuprofen. He woke up from sleep the following morning with worsening thigh pain and notable swelling and was evaluated by his primary care physician. He was immediately referred to the sports medicine clinic. Physical Exam: Patient appeared anxious and uncomfortable, preferentially keeping his right knee in slight flexion, hesitant to move it. He had pronounced swelling of the right thigh extending down to the knee. The overlying skin was warm but appeared slightly mottled. No bruising was noted. The anterior thigh was firm to the touch and exquisitely tender to palpation. Pain was exacerbated with passive flexion of the knee. He was able to activate his quadriceps muscle with considerable discomfort. He had strong pulses behind the medial malleolus and on the dorsum of the right foot. Capillary refill was less than 2 seconds. He had slightly decreased sensation of the toes on the right foot. Differential Diagnosis: Quadriceps contusion Femur fracture Myositis ossificans Compartment syndrome Skin and soft tissue infection Test Results: Complete Blood Count (CBC) had a slightly low hemoglobin of 12.4 g/dL but was otherwise unremarkable. Basic Metabolic Panel (BMP) was within normal limits. Creatine Kinase (CK) was elevated to 441 U/L. C-Reactive Protein (CRP) was slightly elevated to 1.5 mg/dL. Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) was within normal limits. Radiograph of the right femur and knee were negative for fracture or other bony abnormalities. Compartment Pressure Analysis was performed. Pre-procedure blood pressure was Final Diagnosis: Traumatic compartment syndrome of the anterior compartment of the right thigh. Discussion: Traumatic compartment syndrome of the thigh represents a rare but serious condition with limb threatening or life threatening consequences if diagnosis is delayed. Unlike compartment of syndrome of the lower leg, compartment syndrome of the thigh may have a more insidious onset of symptoms as the thigh compartments are much larger, with much more potential space to accommodate swelling before there is neurovascular compromise. As such, patients with traumatic compartment syndrome of the thigh may present several days, even weeks after their initial injury. A high index of suspicion is required to facilitate prompt surgical intervention to avoid irreversible consequences. Outcome: Patient was directed to the emergency department. Compartment pressure analysis was consistent with compartment syndrome requiring emergent fasciotomy of the anterior compartment of the right thigh. He required 2 days of vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) of his wound before he returned to the operating room for delayed primary closure. He was discharged home the following day. Follow-up: Post-operative course was complicated by fevers and pain requiring hospitalization. Fevers were attributed to elevated cytokine release from reabsorption of blood after wound infection and DVT were ruled out. Pain improved with splinting and narcotics. Sutures were removed and he was transitioned to a knee immobilizer. He has started physical therapy and is making slow but steady progress.","2019","2020-05-20 00:39:21","2020-05-20 00:39:21","","e35-e36","","2","29","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/JSM.0000000000000728; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629860452","sports medicine; adult; conference abstract; football player; human; male; case report; clinical article; helmet; young adult; follow up; hemoglobin; outcome assessment; C reactive protein; blood pressure; physiotherapy; splinting; creatine kinase; complication; endogenous compound; hypesthesia; touch; X ray film; fasciotomy; quadriceps femoris muscle; diagnosis; differential diagnosis; drug combination; fever; emergency ward; contusion; general practitioner; suture; sleep; palpation; toe; operating room; ibuprofen; swelling; lower leg; blood cell count; knee immobilizer; compartment syndrome; cytokine release; dorsal region; erythrocyte sedimentation rate; femur fracture; hospitalization; medial malleolus; muscle relaxant agent; narcotic agent; ossifying myositis; skin infection; soft tissue infection; vacuum assisted closure; wound infection","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Rugby union became a professional sport in 1995 allowing rugby to become a stand-alone career. This alteration in employment structure resulted in stronger athletes, thus resulting in an increase of injury making a career in sports more uncertain. In an effort to address the growing concern of injury-induced retirement, the Rugby Players' Association's created the Benevolent Fund1 in 2001. The Foundation was to provide assistance to players during times of injury and provide educational opportunities to assist in career transition. This article highlights how the transition to a professional game created the 'Quad-Lemma' of rugby injury and how the Rugby Players Association was created to address the welfare concerns of the new professional format of rugby union.

The aim of the present study was to give voice to elite athletes exploring their perceptions of cheating in sport. Methods. Utilizing a purposeful sampling technique, 11 athletes were interviewed -- one woman and 10 men from football (F, n = 6), rugby league (R, n = 2), and three from athletics (A). Athletes' perceptions related to cheating in sport were explored by individual semi-structured interviews. Interpretive thematic data analysis was conducted in several stages, beginning with the exploration of the recorded materials. Credibility of the results was established by member checking. For data transferability and repeatability, we described the process of data collection, processing and analysis in detail. Results. Analysis of interview data allows to distinguish the following broad themes: the perceived forms of cheating in sport, causes of cheating, initiators of cheating, and athletes' views on the evaluation of cheating, and as a separate theme -- athletes' insights on cheating in children's sport. Conclusions. The findings offer insights of adult athletes on cheating in sport. Athletes are aware of the prevalence of cheating in all sports, emphasizing that it is an illegal phenomenon and associate it with the potential financial benefits, corruption, match fixing, and the use of doing. The study highlights financial insecurity of athletes as a reason for cheating. When evaluating cheating, athletes are not categorical or tend to cheat themselves, but they would justify it more if it helped a team. As to cheating in children's sport, adult athletes noted the role of a coach and especially the parents in cheating in order to gain an advantage for their child. Also, the focus on the protective factor of children against cheating was emphasized.

Standard bilateral lower limb anteroposterior weight-bearing radiographs were acquired and clinical measurement of intercondylar/intermalleolar (ICD/IMD) distance was performed. Coronal plane mechanical alignment was assessed by five angles: leg mechanical axis (LMA), lateral proximal femoral angle (LPFA), lateral distal femoral angle (LDFA), medial proximal tibial angle (MPTA), and lateral distal tibial angle (LDTA). Their values were compared to the reference values for adult population. An inter-individual comparison between right/left and dominant/non-dominant leg was added. The sum of bilateral LMA was correlated against ICD/IMD and against ICD/IMD adjusted for body height.Results: Football players presented with ICD/IMD of 46.5 (19.8) mm. Two, out of five, lower leg coronal angles showed significant differences (p < 0.001) compared to reference data from literature: LMA 5.8 (3.0)º vs.1.2 (2.2)º and MPTA 83.5 (2.6)º vs. 87.2 (1.5)º. No significant differences between left/right leg and dominant/non-dominant leg were established. Summed up bilateral LMA showed a high correlation to IMD/ICD (r = 0.8395; R2 = 0.7048), and even higher to ICD/IMD adjusted for body height (r = 0.8543; R2 = 0.7298).Conclusions: This study was radiographically confirming increased varus of elite football players toward general population. Apex of the varus deformity was located in the proximal tibia. Clinical measurement of ICD/IMD adjusted for body height highly correlated with the radiographic values of coronal alignment; therefore, it may be used in population studies.","2019","2020-05-20 00:39:31","2020-05-20 00:39:31","","1771-1777","","12","139","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","","","","https://gateway.library.qut.edu.au/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=c8h&AN=139458422&site=ehost-live&scope=site","Adult; Football -- Physiology; Male; Scales; Questionnaires; Weight-Bearing -- Physiology; Young Adult; Knee Joint; Knee Joint -- Physiology; Bone Diseases; Reference Values","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Twenty-two professional male rugby players were randomized into CWI (10 °C/10 min; n = 11) or control (CON: 30 min seated; n = 11) groups. Activity profile from Global Positioning Satellite systems and postmatch rating of perceived exertion were measured to determined match load. Biochemical (tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6), neuromuscular performance (squat (SJ) and countermovement jumps (CMJ), peak power output (PPO), rate of force development (RFD), stiffness, 10- and 30-m sprint time, and perceptual markers (soreness, perceived recovery) were obtained before and immediately after the match, and then at 30 min, 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h after the match. Magnitude-based inference and Cohen's effect size (ES) were used to analyze change over time and between groups. Thus, the higher/beneficial, similar/trivial, or lower/harmful differences were evaluated as follows: <1%, almost certainly not; 1% to 5%, very unlikely; 5% to 25%, unlikely; 25% to 75%, possible; 75% to 95%, likely; 95% to 99%, very likely; >99%, almost certainly. Changes were unclear for the match loads, sprint times, and perceptual markers between groups. Higher %ΔSJ at 24 h (very likely (ES = 0.75)) and in %ΔPPO_SJ at 48 h (likely (ES = 0.51)) were observed in CWI than in CON. Values in %ΔRDF_CMJ were higher immediately after (likely (ES = 0.83)), 30 min after (very likely (ES = 0.97)), and 24 h after the match (likely (ES = 0.93)) in CWI than in CON. Furthermore, %Δlog TNF-α were lower in the CWI group than in the CON group immediately after (almost certainly (ES = -0.76)), 24 h after (very likely (ES = -1.09)), and 72 h after the match (likely (ES = -0.51)), and in Δstiffness_SJ at 30 min after (likely (ES = -0.67)) and 48 h after the match (very likely (ES = -0.97)). Also, different within-groups effects throughout postmatch were reported. Implementing postmatch CWI-based strategies improved the recovery of markers of inflammation and fatigue in rugby players, despite no change in markers of speed or perceptual recovery.","2019","2020-05-20 00:39:39","2020-05-20 00:39:39","","546-556","","5","44","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/apnm-2018-0542; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L627287013","adult; human; male; football; controlled study; athlete; young adult; randomized controlled trial; athletic performance; biological marker; immersion; muscle fatigue; inflammation; cold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Ten well-trained, male soccer athletes randomly completed 3 trials: work-to-rest ratio (SEPT) 1:5, SEPT/1:8, and a control trial. Training load during SEPT was monitored using global positioning system and heart-rate monitors. Performance (isokinetic strength of knee extensors and flexors, speed, and countermovement jump) and muscle damage (delayed-onset muscle soreness [DOMS] and creatine kinase) were evaluated at baseline and at 0, 24, 48 and 72 h posttraining. Maximal voluntary contraction (fatigue index) of knee extensors and flexors was additionally assessed at 1, 2, and 3 h posttraining. RESULTS: Fatigue increased (P < .05) in SEPT/1:5 (∼4-30%) for 3 h and in SEPT/1:8 (∼8-17%) for 2 h. Strength performance declined (P < .05) in both SEPT trials (∼5-20%) for 48 h. Speed decreased (∼4-18%; P < .05) for 72 h in SEPT/1:5 and for 48 h in SEPT/1:8. Countermovement-jump performance decreased (∼7-12%; P < .05) in both SEPT trials for 24 h. DOMS increased (P < .05) in SEPT/1:5 (∼2-fold) for 72 and in SEPT/1:8 (∼1- to 2-fold) for 48 h. Creatine kinase increased (∼1- to 2-fold, P < .05) in both SEPT trials for 72 h. CONCLUSIONS: SEPT induces short-term neuromuscular fatigue; provokes a prolonged deterioration of strength (48 h), speed (72 h), and jump performance (24 h); and is associated with a prolonged (72-h) rise of DOMS and creatine kinase. Time for recovery is reduced when longer work-to-rest ratios are applied. Fitness status may affect quality of SEPT and recovery kinetics.","2019","2020-05-20 00:39:41","2020-05-20 00:39:41","","1-14","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1123/ijspp.2018-0984; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629941142","adult; human; male; article; football; soccer player; knee; heart rate; controlled study; global positioning system; creatine kinase; muscle injury; remission; endogenous compound; kinetics; endurance training; muscle weakness; deterioration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It was hypothesized that rate characteristics of force development would demonstrate a different response magnitude and recovery time course than peak force measurements. Methods: Force-time characteristics of the IMTP (peak force, 0- to 50-ms rate of force development [RFD], 100- to 200-ms RFD) were collected at 48 (G+2), 72 (G+3), and 96 h (G+4) after 3 competitive Australian rules football matches. Results: Meaningful reductions (>75% of the smallest worthwhile change) were observed at G+2, G+3, and G+4 for RFD 0-50 milliseconds (-25.8%, -17.5%, and -16.9%) and at G+2 and G+3 for RFD 100-200 milliseconds (-15.7% and -11.7%). No meaningful reductions were observed for peak force at any time point (G+2 -4.0%, G+3 -3.9%, G+4 -2.7%). Higher week-to-week variation was observed for RFD 0-50 milliseconds (G+2 17.1%, G+3 27.2%, G+4 19.3%) vs both RFD 100-200 milliseconds (G+2 11.3%, G+3 11.5%, G+4 7.2%) and peak force (G+2 4.8%, G+3 4.4%, G+4 8.4%). Conclusions: These findings highlight the potential use of rate characteristics from the IMTP as measures of neuromuscular function in elite sport settings, and in particular RFD 100-200 milliseconds due to its higher reliability. Interestingly, peak force collected from the IMTP was not meaningfully suppressed at any time point after elite Australian rules football match play. This suggests that rate characteristics from IMTP may provide more sensitive and valuable insight regarding neuromuscular function recovery kinetics than peak measures.","2019","2020-05-20 00:39:43","2020-05-20 00:39:43","","765–770","","6","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1123/ijspp.2018-0349; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628036300","human; male; football; thigh; athlete; young adult; physiology; muscle strength; exercise test; creatine kinase; Australia; skeletal muscle; muscle isometric contraction; blood; time factor","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In particular we focus on the perceptive aspects specific to this sport, trying to understand what may be the parameters that have a greater physical benefit and what are the psychological improvements. Through some questions asked to a group of 20 boys, aged between 23 and 29, it was found that, for the sample examined, recreational football on a physical level could lead to an improvement in physical endurance (65%), but that does not greatly affect the decrease in body fat (45%). While on a psychological level, it is considered a very relaxing sport (80%) and socially aggregating (95%).Therefore, according to many other studies, this type of activity, both in terms of perceptions and real data, significantly improves the general physical and psychological well-being of the person who practices it.

Rectus femoris injuries commonly occur in sports requiring kicking and sprinting, such as Australian Rules Football (Australian Football League [AFL]) and soccer. The integrity of the connective tissue scaffolding (such as the epimysial envelope and central intramuscular tendon rachis) supporting rectus femoris muscle fibers is vital to muscle function and recovery. Methods and Materials: We designed a study to determine whether a correlation exists between connective tissue injury as graded on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and return to play (RTP). A retrospective review of all acute rectus femoris muscle injuries reported to the AFL soft tissue registry between 2013 and 2018 was undertaken. Severity of muscle and connective tissue structural injury was graded (0-3) by three musculoskeletal radiologists by consensus in each case. Definitions are as follows: grade 1, myofibril disruption/detachment with connective tissue intact; grade 2, myofibril disruption/detachment with connective tissue delamination/partial tear; and grade 3, myofibril disruption/detachment with connective tissue defect/full-thickness tear. Injury location and previous injury (scar) were also recorded. Rehabilitation data were provided by the AFL Research Board (soft tissue registry). Subsequently the correlation between injury grade and RTP was determined. Results: There were 60 rectus femoris injuries with a complete data set included for analysis. In terms of injury location, 22 of the 60 injuries (37%) involved the central intramuscular tendon rachis (indirect head origin); 32 (53%) involved the epimysial envelope. Of these epimysial injuries, 15 (25%) involved the posterior epimysium, 10 (16.7%) involved the anterior epimysium (direct head origin), and 7 were lateral injuries. Grade 1 injuries were found in 21 of 60 (35%); grade 2 in 24 of 60 (40%), and the remaining 15 cases (25%) had grade 3 tears. RTP was available in 45 of 60 cases, and injury grade was found to have a direct correlation with RTP (and return to training [RFT]). The median RTP for grade 1, 2, and 3 injuries was 14 days (range: 7-29 days); 28 days (range: 14-82 days), and 41 days (20-82 days), respectively (p < 0.001). RFT was utilized in the 15 out-of-season injury cases and also proved statistically significant (p = 0.005). Conclusion: This study demonstrates a direct correlation between connective tissue injury severity and the RTP/RFT interval. An MRI grading system based on connective tissue integrity has the potential to guide appropriate and safe rehabilitation for acute rectus femoris injuries in elite athletes participating in kicking and sprinting sports.","2019","2020-05-20 00:39:48","2020-05-20 00:39:48","","","","","23","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629059300; http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/s-0039-1692554","conference abstract; human; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; controlled study; major clinical study; season; sport; athlete; retrospective study; rectus femoris muscle; muscle injury; soft tissue; endogenous compound; head; thickness; musculoskeletal radiologist; consensus; scar; tendon; disease course; connective tissue disease; epimysium; muscle fibril; tissue injury","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The risk of subsequent ACL reinjury to either the ipsilateral or the contralateral knee in National Football League (NFL) draftees with a history of successful ACL reconstruction before entering the NFL remains unknown. Hypothesis: NFL athletes with a history of successful ACL reconstruction before being drafted will likely demonstrate increased risk of subsequent ACL injury when compared with a control cohort consisting of players of similar positions and draft class. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: Detailed orthopaedic evaluations of NFL Combine participants from 2006 to 2012 were obtained to identify players entering the NFL draft with a history of successful ACL reconstruction. A control cohort was created in a 2:1 ratio, consisting of players matched by position and draft class. Results: Of the 2016 players invited to the NFL Combine during the study period, 100 met the inclusion criteria. A total of 26 subsequent ACL reinjuries (12 ipsilateral, 14 contralateral) occurred in 25 players (25%) while playing in the NFL, with injuries occurring at a mean of 22.1 months after the NFL draft. In comparison, 18 of the 200 (9%) carefully matched cohort players without history of prior ACL injury sustained a new ACL injury during this time period (P <.001). Conclusion: NFL athletes with a history of successful ACL reconstruction before being drafted into the NFL have a significantly higher rate of subsequent ACL reinjury while playing in the NFL when compared with a carefully matched cohort of players without a history of prior ACL injury.","2019","2020-05-20 00:39:50","2020-05-20 00:39:50","","","","12","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2325967119891413; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2003949944","human; article; football; clinical article; priority journal; controlled study; incidence; cohort analysis; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; risk assessment; outcome assessment; recurrent disease; anterior cruciate ligament injury; case control study; clinical evaluation; anterior cruciate ligament","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Background Athletes diagnosed with ADHD have a heightened risk (2 to 4-fold) for sustaining concussion. However, their response to repetitive SHI remain unclear. Design/Methods In this case-control intervention study, 17 soccer players clinically diagnosed with ADHD who take their prescribed medication daily, were assigned a heading intervention (ADHD-Heading group), individuals who met the ADHD criteria but were non-soccer players, were assigned into a kicking group, (ADHD-Kicking group, n = 15). Whereas 34 soccer players without ADHD diagnosis were randomized into either a heading or kicking intervention, yielding Non-ADHD-Heading group (n = 17) or Non-ADHD-Kicking group (n = 17). To implement SHI, the heading groups executed 10 headers with a standard soccer ball projected at a velocity of 25 mph (equivalent to a long throw-in) over 10 minutes by a JUGS soccer machine, while the kicking groups performed 10 kicks. Neurocognitive function was measured via the Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing (ImPACT) at preintervention baseline, 0h, 2h, and 24h post-intervention. Results The vulnerability to SHI was notable in subjects diagnosed with ADHD particularly in memory, as illustrated by a significant group × time interaction, F(6,96) = 3.796, p = 0.002. Both Kicking groups improved verbal memory over time indicating the brain's ability to learn, whereas the Non-ADHD-Heading group showed no improvement. The ADHD-Heading group showed a significant decline at 0h and 2h post-heading compared to other groups. As for visual memory, the ADHD-Heading group showed a significant decline at 24h post; however, all other groups displayed improvement. There were no group differences in remaining domains. Conclusions Data suggests neurocognitive vulnerability in athletes diagnosed with ADHD after experiencing SHI, specifically in memory performance. These outcomes can better inform clinicians; overall, promoting a better personalized care in athletes diagnosed with ADHD.","2019","2020-05-20 00:39:52","2020-05-20 00:39:52","","S29","","14","93","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1212/01.wnl.0000581116.83066.44; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629665685","adult; conference abstract; female; human; male; soccer player; brain; clinical article; controlled study; concussion; randomized controlled trial; verbal memory; visual memory; attention deficit disorder; intervention study","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There is currently limited research on an effective teaching method to improve safe heading technique. In the current study, Behavior Skills Training (BST) was evaluated as a method to teach correct heading techniques to youth soccer players. BST increased the percentage of correct steps for each player based on a task analysis of heading.

When the latent qualities of competitors are inferred from a cumulative sequence of observations (e.g., the sum of points collected by sports teams), impressions should be based solely on the most recent observation because all previous observations are redundant. Based on the well-documented human inability to adequately discount redundant information, we predicted the existence of a cumulative redundancy bias. Accordingly, perceivers' impressions are systematically biased by the unfolding of a performance sequence when observations are cumulative. This bias favors leading competitors and persists even when the end result of the performance sequence is known. We demonstrated this cumulative redundancy bias in 8 experiments in which participants had to sequentially form impressions about the qualities of two competitors from different performance domains (i.e., computer algorithms, stocks, and soccer teams). We consistently found that perceivers' impressions were biased by cumulative redundancy. Specifically, impressions about the winner and the loser of a sequence were more divergent when the winner took an early lead compared with a late lead. When the sequence ended in a draw, participants formed more favorable impressions about the competitor who was ahead during most observations. We tested and ruled out several alternative explanations related to primacy effects, counterfactual thinking, and heuristic beliefs. We discuss the wide-ranging implications of our findings for impression formation and performance evaluation.

Los resultados evidencian la estructura bifactorial (compromiso actual y compromiso futuro) de la escala planteada por Orlick (2004) y validada en el contexto español con futbolistas adolescentes por Belando, Ferriz-Morell, y Moreno-Murcia (2012). Se ha comprobado que las horas de entrenamiento y la edad de los deportistas influye en el compromiso hacia el deporte, sin embargo, el sexo y la modalidad deportiva no es en ningún caso determinante.

Participated of the study 23 young soccer players (15.3 ± 1.1 years, 175 ± 6 cm, 64 ± 7 kg) of the sub15 and sub17 categories of the team from the 1st division championship Paulista. The maturational status was determined by the age of the peak height velocity (PHV), used as relative indicator of somatic maturity and are calculated trhough measures of height, trunk-cephalic height, leg length, body weight, and skinfolds. The Heart rate variability (HRV) measures were obtained in rest during 5 minutes and, posteriorly, analyzed by the variable root mean square of the successive difference (rMSSD). For the intermittent endurance test the subjects performed the Yoyo intermittent recovery test level 2 (YIRT 2), before the HRV measures has been taken. The results of the present study shown which there was not relationship between parasympathetic heart rate modulation (rMSSD = 57,4 ± 26,4 ms) and status biological maturation (0,67 ± 0,81 years) of the young soccer players (r= 0,30; p=0,163), then that the intermittent endurance test (YIRT 2= 658 ± 151 m) has a great correlation with PHV (r= 0,71; p< 0,001). The parasympathetic heart rate modulation has a great correlation with intermittent endurance test of the players (r= 0,54; p= 0,007). In this way, the use of the PHV age and HRV as indicator of performance in YIRT2 in young soccer players is suggested.

The sample included 40 male athletes, from volleyball (n: 13, 15.46 ± 1.12 years, 179 ± 0.05 cm, 66.85 ± 5.44 kg) basketball (n: 7, 15, 28 ± 0.88 years, 1.81 ± 0.07 cm, 73 ± 10.88 kg) and futsal (n: 20, 15.70 ± 1.34 years, 172 ± 0.06 cm, 65.2 ± 11, 61kg). The collection took place in a single moment. The maximum oxygen consumption was determined from the 20 meter shuttle test. To determine the power of upper limbs, the medicine-ball pitch test was applied using the Proesp-Br (2007) protocol. To assess the power of the lower limbs, the countermovement vertical jump technique was applied on a sensorized platform, following the assumptions defined by Bosco (1993). The speed assessment occurred from a 20-meter run, following the protocol of Proesp-Br (2007). The identification of maturation stages was carried out using Cameron's simplified pubertal questionnaire. For statistical analysis, the Shapiro-Wilk test was applied. To analyze the relationships between the modalities and the results of the motor tests, the Kruskal-Wallis test was adopted. In cases where there were differences, multiple comparison tests were performed. Significantly higher results could be seen in the 20m t, 20m back and forth and countermovement jump between basketball and volleyball. It was also observed that the recent pubertal and late pubertal maturation stages significantly influenced the height obtained in the countermovement jump by the athletes of the evaluated modalities.

Objective: 1) To describe and compare the physical demands (total covered meters and meters covered at high speed ranges), between the teams of the Spanish First and Second Division league. 2) To determine if the distance covered of the teams is related to the sports success (final classification, the points obtained and the goals in favour and against). Method: A total of 712 games (First and Second Division) were analysed using a computerized multi-camera system (Mediacoach, Mediapro and LaLiga ©). In order to quantify the physical performance, the following distances were recorded: total distance (TD), the distance covered between 21-24 km/h (DHI) and distance covered above 24km/h) (DVHI). In order to quantify the sports success, we considered the final classification, the obtained points as well as the goals in favour and against. Results: The total distance covered by the teams of the First and Second Division Leagues was similar, however, the distance covered at high intensity and distance covered at very high intensity was greater in the teams of the First Division (p<0.05; d of Cohen >1.2). No relations were detected between the meters covered and the recorded success indicators. Conclusion: This data should be taken into account by the coaches and physical trainers when guiding the training process of their teams. The distance covered during the competition does not have a direct relationship with success.

This study aimed to examine the relationship between balance and coordination and football participation in adolescents with ID. The study involved 197 male participants with ID aged between 14 and 19 years (16.22±2.00), of which 110 (65 mild ID, 45 moderate ID) played soccer in a school team, and 87 (48 mild ID, 39 moderate ID) did not participate in any sport. Balance and coordination skills were evaluated using the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency, second edition short form (BOT-2 SF). A significant positive relationship was found between all the balance and co-ordination sub-tests and the duration of playing football in the adolescents with ID (p<0.05). Balance and co-ordination scores were significantly higher in both the mild and moderate ID participants, who played football compared with the individuals with ID who did no sport (p<0.05). In adolescents with moderate ID, the difference in the 7th item of the balance sub-test was not significant. The results indicate that football participation and balance and coordination are related in adolescents with mild and moderate ID.

The aim of this study was to investigate body mass index (BMI), body fat percentage (%BF), dietary intake (energy, carbohydrate, and protein) and its relationship with muscle fatigue among adolescent football players. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study involving 26 football players aged 15-17 years. BMI was determined using BMIfor- age percentile (kg/m2).%BF was analysed using Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA) and categorized using bodyfat curves for children. Dietary intake was assessed using 3x24 hours dietary recall. Running-Based Anaerobic Sprint Test (RAST) was conducted twice and averaged to identify muscle fatigue. We used Pearson test to evaluate the significance relationship between variables. Results: The results showed that most subjects had healthy weight (17.6 ± 1.82 kg/m2), good diet pattern (energy 99.1 ± 14.3%, carbohydrate 92.9 ± 9.5%, protein 96 ± 23.4%), but underfat (6.8 ± 2.1%). Negative correlations were found significantly in: muscle fatigue and BMI (r = -0.393, p = 0.047), as well as%BF (r = -0.458, p = 0.019). Meanwhile, there was significant correlation in energy intake and muscle fatigue (r = 0.538, p = 0.005). Carbohydrate and protein intake did not show any significant relationship with muscle fatigue however. Conclusion: In conclusion, to reach the highest performance during the game, it is essential for football players to maintain BMI and%BF at normal range, as well as consuming adequate amount of food containing energy in daily basis.","2019","2020-05-20 00:40:11","2020-05-20 00:40:11","","133","","3","75","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1159/000501751; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629278630","conference abstract; female; football player; human; male; controlled study; adolescent; body mass; running; body weight; cross-sectional study; child; body fat; caloric intake; carbohydrate; carbohydrate intake; protein intake; recall; muscle fatigue; impedance; dietary pattern; sport nutrition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Relationship between distinct physical capacities in young Welsh rugby players. J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2019-We examined the correlations between aerobic fitness (assessed by the 30-15 intermittent fitness test [IFT]), maximum isometric strength, vertical jump, and speed performance of 37 under-16 (U16) Welsh regional rugby players. The physical assessments used in this research are part of a regional development program under the auspices of the players' development pathway created by the Welsh Rugby Union. The tests were performed in the following order: vertical jumps, isometric midthigh pull, 40-m sprint velocity, and 30-15 IFT. A Pearson's product moment correlation coefficient was used to estimate the magnitude of the relationships between the different physical variables. Overall, we found significant associations between jump height, sprint velocity, maximum isometric strength, and 30-15 IFT performance (r ranging from 0.44 to 0.70). Moreover, strong positive interrelationships were observed between strength, speed, and jump qualities (r ranging from 0.51 to 0.80). Although these findings remain to be established in prospective studies, it seems that U16 athletes are capable of simultaneously improving their aerobic fitness and neuromuscular performance. This can be confirmed by the close correlations between the 30-15 IFT and every neuromechanical parameter reported here. Therefore, practitioners are recommended to use multifaceted training schemes with their young rugby players, including different components of endurance, speed, strength, and power training.","2019","2020-05-20 00:40:12","2020-05-20 00:40:12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1519/JSC.0000000000003459; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L630345510","human; article; rugby; controlled study; prospective study; athlete; velocity; endurance; physician; correlation coefficient; physical capacity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The importance of fundamental motor skills as a substantial basis of sport-specific motor skills is generally accepted. However, up until now, research on the relationship between fundamental and specific motor skills in soccer players has been missing. The aim of this study, therefore, was to investigate the relationship between fundamental motor skills and game specific motor skills in elite young football players (N = 24; mean age 11.6 ± 0.4 years). Football specific dribbling and shooting test as a game-specific motor skills and The Test of Gross Motor Skills - 2nd edition (TGMD-2) as a set of fundamental motor skills were used. We found a strong relationship between TGMD-2 and game-specific motor skills (r = 0.62 - 0.70). The horizontal jump and catch were found to be the best predictors of game-specific motor skills (F(2, 21) = 21.13, p < 0.001, R2 = 0.64). The players reported the poorest performance in several subtests: striking a stationary ball, overhand throw, underhand roll, and horizontal jump. These results demonstrate the need for a certain level of both fine and gross fundamental motor skills in order to acquire game-specific motor skills. Youth coaches should emphasize adequate development of FMS, particularly during early and middle childhood. Coaches should especially develop and improve a wide range of fundamental motor skills as building blocks of more complex and difficult, football-specific, motor skills during the long-term training process.

Methods: We selected 5 healthy football players. They performed the inside, instep, and infront kick 3 times each with right foot. 3D motion analysis device was used to record their motion. The motion analysis software was used to calculate stress between hip joints and the angle of the hip joint. In addition, the bone strength analysis software was used to analyze the CT and MRI data of each subject to develop a finite-element (FE) model. Then, hip joints calculated in dynamics analysis was input as a load value into the FE model for the stress analysis. Results: At the time of BI, kicking motions produced a highstress area in the pubic ramus compared with other areas. Stress generated in the superior and inferior rami of the pubic bone was 3.52 and 2.94 MPa for the inside kick, 7.15 and 5.40 Mpa for the instep kick, and 4.47 and 3.33 Mpa for the infront kick, respectively. Compared to the static posture, the stress distribution at the superior and inferior pubic ramus was 3-fold and 2-fold, respectively. Conclusions: The high-stress area was the same area where groin pain syndrome occurs in the clinical examination of football- related hip joint injury and where fatigue fractures occur in pubic bone rami. Then, the values of equivalent stress generated by the inside kick, instep kick, and infront kick in the superior and inferior rami were approximately 3-fold, 5-fold, and 3-fold. We revealed the relationship between the clinical symptoms of the hip joint and previously reported kick-related injuries around the hip joint. Clinical implications: It was found that the kicking motion in football includes not only muscle stress but also bone stress confirmed by clinical findings. It should be taken into consideration that not only the muscle tightness but also the kicking motion itself affects the bone.

Thus, this study investigated the relationship between objective measures of sleep and training load across different phases of the ACF season. Methods: 23 ACF players' (21.1 ± 1.2 years; 108.0 ± 20.0 kg). sleep/wake behaviour and daily external training load were assessed using wristwatch actigraphy and accelerometry (PlayerLoadTM [PL]), respectively, for a minimum of 3 nights/days in each phase (Off-season, Camp [Pre-season], In-Season and School). The relationships between each sleep metric and both season phase and external training load were assessed using linear mixed models. Results: Overall, total sleep time was very likely shorter in Camp (−41 ± 13 min, effect size [ES 0.68 ± 0.36[), almost certainly shorter In-Season (−56 ± 14 min, ES 0.93 ± 0.39) and likely shorter in School (−28 ± 15 min, ES 0.46 ± 0.42) compared to the Off-season phase. There was almost certainly a difference in sleep latency during the school phase (ES = 4.67 ± 2.03). Conclusion: These data suggest sleep time is reduced during periods of intensified training in ACF players. Of further concern are the demands placed upon student-athletes during the School phase, where aspects of sleep can be compromised.

At elite level, muscle injuries of the lower-extremity are the most common among male football players, and the research hitherto is limited. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether personality traits affect the incidence of muscle injuries among male football players from the first league in Sweden. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: A male football team from the first league in Sweden was prospectively followed, in terms of muscle injuries of the lower-extremity during 8 seasons, between 2007 and 2015. INTERVENTION: All muscle injuries included in this study were evaluated and diagnosed with ultrasonography. Players from the team filled out the Swedish Universities Scales of Personality questionnaire. Swedish Universities Scales of Personality questionnaire consists of 91 items and is divided into 13 categories. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The raw values of each scale were linearly transformed to T scores, having a mean (SD) of 50 (10). All variables were summarized with standard descriptive statistics, such as frequency, mean, and SD. As data were of interval scale and no variable distribution was severely skewed, differences between noninjured players, rarely injured players, and frequently injured players were analyzed with 1-way analysis of variance with post hoc tests by Tukey honestly significant difference test. RESULTS: No significant difference in personality traits were observed between noninjured players, rarely injured players, and frequently injured players regarding number of muscle injuries (P > .05). However, a trend (P = .07) was seen, where frequently injured players scored higher on stress susceptibility than rarely injured players. CONCLUSION: A player's stress susceptibility should be taken into consideration by the player, coaches, and medical staff when assessing the risk of a muscle injury. Also, preventive measures available for these players may need to be considered.","2019","2020-05-20 00:40:19","2020-05-20 00:40:19","","1-6","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1123/jsr.2018-0473; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629637354","adult; football player; human; male; article; lower limb; exercise; controlled study; incidence; prospective study; season; analysis of variance; cohort analysis; risk assessment; psychology; questionnaire; medical staff; echography; muscle injury; post hoc analysis; stress; Sweden; personality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The authors examined the influence of somatic symptom endorsement on the relationship between SRC history and self-reported depressive symptom severity in retired NFL athletes. Forty-three former NFL athletes completed self-report inventories of depression (with the Beck Depression Inventory II) and somatic symptoms (with the adjusted Patient Health Questionnaire-15). A moderation analysis examined the influence of somatic symptoms on the relationship between SRC history and depressive symptom severity. SRC history and somatic symptoms accounted for a significant amount of depressive symptomology. SRC history was not significantly associated with depressive symptom severity at low levels of somatic symptoms but was significant at the mean and high levels. The effect of somatic symptoms on depressive symptoms was nearly twice that of SRC history. The relationship between SRC and depression is complex, and treatment of depression in retired athletes should address comorbid somatic symptoms.","2019","2020-05-20 00:40:22","2020-05-20 00:40:22","","17-24","","1","31","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1176/appi.neuropsych.18040080; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2001555013","adult; football player; human; article; football; brain concussion; clinical article; priority journal; controlled study; sport; athlete; disease severity; questionnaire; pain; depression; demography; dizziness; medical history; nausea; self report; dyspnea; headache; arm pain; faintness; thorax pain; Beck Depression Inventory; heart disease; symptomatology; backache; retirement; arthralgia; leg pain; diarrhea; constipation; feeling your heart pound; gas diffusion; indigestion; moderation analysis; National Football League; Patient Health Questionnaire 15; psychoanalysis; psychosomatic disorder; sport related concussion; stomach pain","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Relationship between running economy and kinematic parameters in long-distance runners. J Strength Cond Res 33(7): 1921-1928, 2019--The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between running economy (RE) and sagittal, frontal, and transverse plane kinematic parameters in long-distance runners. A secondary purpose was to identify the kinematic predictors of RE during running at the lowest RE value, representing an individual's most efficient running intensity. Twenty recreational long- distance runners ran 3 submaximal stages on a treadmill (65, 75, and 85% of velocity at maximum oxygen consumption). Respiratory data were collected using a portable gas analysis system. Kinematics were gathered using passive retroreflective markers and 8 high-resolution infrared cameras to collect the respective trajectories. Hip, knee, and ankle angles at foot strike and stance phase, as well as spatio-temporal parameters were calculated during each gait cycle. Knee flexion/extension range of motion (ROM), knee ab/adduction ROM, and hip ab/adduction ROM during the stance phase of the gait cycle showed positive moderate to large correlations with RE (r 6 90% confidence intervals = 0.51 ± 0.29; 0.49 ± 0.30; 0.53 6 0.28, respectively). Knee and hip ab/adduction ROMs during the stance phase are predictors of RE, accounting for 44% of RE variance. Therefore, sagittal and frontal plane kinematics affect RE-inducing alterations in running performance. Coaches, athletic trainers, and anyone involved in running training prescription should consider a relationship between these parameters to ensure optimal technique and, consequently, to improve RE in recreational long-distance runners.

Sprint motion such as step length and frequency are generally accepted as one of the determining factors of sprint performance. However, there is a paucity of sprint motion studies. Here we sought to analyze sprint motion in outfield positioned amputee soccer players using crutches and to clarify the relationship between sprint speed and sprint motion. Twelve male Japanese outfield players participated; they performed a 30-m sprint with maximum effort. Sprint times and speeds were recorded using electronic timing gates. A high-speed video camera recorded sprint motion. The time and distance of each crutch and step were determined via image analysis. Sprint speed was significantly positively correlated with body mass (r=0.692, p=0.013), length and frequency of one running cycle(r=0.817, p=0.001; r=0.666, p=0.018, respectively), 1st-2nd step length (r=0.890, p=0.001), and crutch-1st step length (r=0.659, p=0.020). In addition, sprint speed was significantly negatively correlated with time taken for each 10-m interval as well as with contact time of first foot (r=-0.881, p=0.001) and crutch stance time (r=- 0.670, p=0.017). Our results suggest that improving sprint speed requires increasing the step length within a shorter time frame in first foot step and crutch stance.

The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the unilateral and bilateral strength and flexibility between the DL and NDL in young soccer players. Material and methods: The sample consisted of 30 individuals (aged 15.97 ± 0.67 years). The isokinetic strength was measured at the velocities of 60° s and 180° s in the concentric action of the quadriceps and hamstrings as well as eccentric of the hamstrings, and in the conventional and functional ratios, along with hip flexion range of motion. Results: The results showed the athletes had an eccentric strength of the hamstrings at 60° s in the DL significantly (p < 0.05) stronger than in the NDL, and the DL had a significant H/Q ratio (p < 0.05) more balanced than the NDL. Conclusions: Young soccer athletes may present a non-standard isokinetic results. These results are observed because of the difference in muscle strength of the posterior thigh compared to DL and NDL and the balance relation between the quadriceps and the hamstrings, generating an asymmetry of strength between the limbs and on the same member. It is necessary to monitor and devise training strategies to avoid these imbalances in order to prevent injuries.","2019","2020-05-20 00:40:29","2020-05-20 00:40:29","","85-90","","203","54","","","","","","","","","","English Spanish","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apunts.2018.11.005; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2001380543","female; human; male; article; soccer player; hamstring muscle; hip; clinical article; adolescent; muscle strength; range of motion; quadriceps femoris muscle; muscle isometric contraction; eccentric muscle contraction; joint mobility; goniometry","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, the aims of this non-interventional study were to evaluate relationships between pre-season training load with biochemical markers, injury incidence and performance during the first month of the competitive period in professional soccer players. Materials and Methods: Healthy professional soccer players were enrolled in this study over two pre-season periods. Data sets were available from 26 players during the first season (2014-2015) and 24 players during the second season (2015-2016) who completed two pre-season periods (6 weeks each). External training load was assessed from all athletes during training using Global Positioning System (GPS). Internal training load was monitored after each training session using rate of perceived exertion (RPE). Before and after each pre-season, blood samples were taken to determine plasma lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase (CK) and C-reactive protein (CRP). Injury incidence and overall performance (ranking of the team after the first five official games of the championship) were recorded for both seasons separately. Results: There was no statistically significant difference in mean RPE values of the two-preparation periods (2737 ± 452 and 2629 ± 786 AU, p = 0.492). The correlational analysis did not reveal significant associations between internal and external training load (RPE and GPS data) and biological markers. There was a significant positive correlation between RPE and LDH during the 2015/2016 season (r = 0.974, p = 0.001). In addition, a significant negative correlation was found between total distance >20 km/h and CRP during the 2015-2016 season (r = -0.863, p = 0.027). The injury rates for the two seasons were 1.76 and 1.06 per 1000 h exposure for the 2014-2015 and 2015-2016 seasons, respectively (p = 0.127). Conclusion: Our study showed that pre-season training load is not associated with overall team performance. This association is most likely multifactorial and other factors (e.g., technical and tactical level of the team, opponents, environment) may play an important role for the collective team performance. Our findings may help coaches to better prepare their athletes during pre-season.","2019","2020-05-20 00:40:35","2020-05-20 00:40:35","","","","APR","10","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2019.00409; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628283687","adult; human; human experiment; article; soccer player; sport injury; exercise intensity; controlled study; training; competition; C reactive protein; normal human; athletic performance; global positioning system; creatine kinase; creatine kinase blood level; protein blood level; sporting event; lactate dehydrogenase; lactate dehydrogenase blood level; biochemical marker; pre season training load; rate of perceived exertion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Maximal-effort (n = 112) and submaximal (n = 1084) running performances of 45 players were recorded from 1 club over 2 consecutive seasons. Poorer and better submaximal running performance was determined by higher and lower exercise heart rates, respectively. Exponentially weighted moving averages and daily rolling averages were used to assess microtechnology-derived acute and chronic field-based workloads. The associations among within-individual submaximal running performance, workload, and noncontact lower-limb injury were then investigated. RESULTS: The injury risk associated with poorer submaximal performance was ""likely"" greater than stable (relative risk = 1.8; 90% confidence interval, 0.9-3.7) and better submaximal performance (relative risk = 2.0; 90% confidence interval, 0.9-4.4). Compared with greater submaximal performance, poorer performance was associated with lower chronic workloads (effect size [d] = 0.82 [0.13], large) and higher acute:chronic workload ratios (d = 0.49 [0.14], small). Chronic workload demonstrated a ""nearly perfect"" positive relationship with maximal-effort running performance (exponentially weighted moving average, R2 = .91 [.15]; rolling average, R2 = .91 [.14]). At acute:chronic workload ratios >1.9, no differences in injury risk were found between rolling average and exponentially weighted moving average methods (relative risk = 1.1; 90% confidence interval, 0.3-3.8; unclear). CONCLUSIONS: Reductions in submaximal running performance are related with low chronic workloads, high acute:chronic workload ratios, and increased injury risk. These findings demonstrate that a submaximal running assessment can be used to provide information on physical performance and injury risk in professional rugby league players.","2019","2020-05-20 00:40:37","2020-05-20 00:40:37","","1-7","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1123/ijspp.2019-0139; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629471498","sports medicine; human; article; lower limb; rugby; injury; controlled study; major clinical study; workload; physical performance; risk assessment; running; effect size; risk factor; microtechnology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, it seems that in movements involving eccentric-concentric muscular contractions, a higher hamstrings-to-quadriceps ratio should have a positive impact on human movement performance. The present study is aimed at identifying relationships between the hamstrings-to-quadriceps ratio and variables describing countermovement and drop jumps. The study was carried out in a group of 14 female soccer players. The tests were conducted using a Kistler force plate, an SG electrogoniometer, and the Biodex System 4 Pro dynamometer. Each player performed three countermovement jumps (CMJ) and three drop jumps (DJ) from heights of 15, 30, 45, and 60 cm. The peak torques of knee extensors and flexors were measured in isometric conditions and in isokinetic conditions at angular velocities of 30o/s, 60o/s, 90o/s, and 120o/s. Statistically significant relationships were found between the variables that describe CMJ, DJ 15, DJ 30, and hamstrings-to-quadriceps ratio at some, though not all, of the angular velocities measured. No significant relationships were found between the hamstrings-to-quadriceps ratio and variables that describe DJ 45 and DJ 60. The heights of CMJ, DJ 15, and DJ 30 were increased with higher hamstrings-to-quadriceps ratios. Analogous relationships were found between the hamstrings-to-quadriceps ratio and relative mechanical power during the take-off phase of the CMJ. Significant relationships between the hamstrings-to-quadriceps ratio and variables that describe vertical jump are likely to be observed if adequate angular velocity is used in the measurement of muscle torque.","2019","2020-05-20 00:40:39","2020-05-20 00:40:39","","","","","2019","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2019/4505481; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628760561","female; human; article; soccer player; hamstring muscle; priority journal; velocity; height; jumping; dynamometer; torque; isokinetic exercise; quadriceps femoris muscle; movement (physiology)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: Community soccer organization. Methods: During a 4-month season, 52 female youth soccer players (aged 13-18 years) reported daily training load (TL) and every morning recorded sleep duration and stress, mood, fatigue, soreness, and sleep quality from -3 (worst) to +3 (best). As all the athletes participate in soccer as their primary sport for over 8 months of the year, players were considered specialized if they participated in soccer exclusively and had previously quit another sport to focus on soccer. Least-square mean values from linear mixed effects models were used to compare TL, subjective well-being, and sleep while adjusting for individual repeated measures. Results: Daily TL during the season did not differ between specialized and nonspecialized athletes (412 ± 24 vs 415 ± 19 arbitrary units, P = 0.96, respectively). Despite similar nightly sleep duration (8.10 ± 0.14 vs 8.25 ± 0.11 hours, P = 0.42), specialized athletes were found to have lower (worse) fatigue (1.02 ± 0.14 vs 1.50 ± 0.11, P = 0.010), soreness (0.66 ± 0.18 vs 1.23 ± 0.14, P = 0.013), mood (1.32 ± 0.12 vs 1.72 ± 0.10, P = 0.013), and sleep quality (1.07 ± 0.13 vs 1.42 ± 0.10, P = 0.035) than the nonspecialized group. Although stress was lower (worse) among the specialized athletes, the difference was not statistically significant (0.97 ± 0.16 vs 1.32 ± 0.13, P = 0.092).

The purpose of this study was the analysis of ACTN3 gene expression during a 2 month training cycle of soccer players and its correlation with the countermovement jump (CMJ) and squat jump (SJ). The study group consisted of 22 soccer players (aged 17‐18). The study material included peripheral blood lymphocytes. The relative expression (RQ) of the ACTN3 gene was analyzed by qPCR and performed before and after the two‐month training cycle. Before the training cycle low expression levels of ACTN3 (median RQ = 0.95) were observed, yet after the training cycle they were elevated (median RQ = 1.98) (p = 0.003). There was an increase in performance of both jumps: SJ (p = 0.020) and CMJ (p = 0.012) at the end of the training cycle. A simultaneous increase in the ACTN3 gene expression level and height in both jump tests was observed in 73% of athletes (p > 0.05). There were no significant relationships between the ACTN3 gene expression level and the results of the CMJ and SJ. However, explosive strength is a complex feature shaped by many different factors and it could be the reason why we did not observe correlations between these variables.

Role of physical fitness and cognitive function in youth soccer players","International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","","1660-4601 1661-7827","10.3390/ijerph16162837","","The need to achieve short-term competitive outcomes in sports may influence the emergence of talent selection strategies, which could bias individuals’ opportunities. The present study aimed to further explore the relative age effect (RAE), a phenomenon that strongly influences youth sport development. The RAE refers to a disproportionately high percentage in sport teams of athletes born early in the selection year. Our primary focus was to explore whether the RAE is supported by behavioral evidence in favor of better fitness—and especially cognitive-attentional functioning—of early as compared to late-born players. A cross-sectional study was conducted on 105 young athletes (u10, n = 52; 9.8 ± 0.3 years old, and u12, n = 53; 11.8 ± 0.2 years old) attending two youth elite soccer academies. Attentional functioning, anthropometrics, physical fitness, and game intelligence were compared across two Age Groups (u10 vs. u12) and four Birth Quarters (BQ1–BQ4). The RAE was statistically significant (p < 0.001), showing that about 50% of participants were born in the first quarter and 75% were born in the first half of the year. More importantly, U12 players outperformed u10 players in measures that were related to sustained attention (with faster and less variable responses; p < 0.001 and p < 0.05, respectively), and in all anthropometric measures (p < 0.001), physical-fitness capacities (p < 0.05). Crucially, neither the attentional measures, game intelligence, anthropometrics, nor physical fitness were affected by BQ (all ps > 0.1 and BF10 between 0.08 and 0.6, showing strong evidence for the null hypothesis). The present findings suggest that the early selection process that occurs during scouting in youth soccer academies offsets the age-related differences that could be anticipated in cognitive skills, anthropometrics, and physical abilities, due to growth and maturation. These birth asymmetries could lead teams to disregard later maturation athletes and athletes born later in the year inducing a larger dropout of those players with the consequent reduction in the talent pool.","2019","2020-05-20 00:40:46","2020-05-20 00:40:46","","","","16","16","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph16162837; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002418202","adult; female; human; human experiment; male; article; soccer player; controlled study; major clinical study; cross-sectional study; attention; fitness; anthropometry; skill; youth sport; physical capacity; null hypothesis; intelligence","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The highest prevalence of athletes born in the first trimester was found in the U-17 (44%) and in the U-20 categories (36%) (P<0.00001). The findings indicated that the Relative Age Effect (RAE) was present in the selection of athletes for the U-17 and U-20 World Cups between 2011 and 2013.

We examined the birthdate distributions of 334 elite football players from Real Club Deportivo de la Coruña: 195 young soccer players (DTG) divided into 11 age groups (U-9 to U-23), 110 professional players (FTG), and 29 players who debuted in competitive matches with the club's first team from the youth development programme (EG). Playing time was calculated by adding up all the minutes played by a player in official competition during a season. The Chi-square test results show that the RAE exists in the 3 groups and in all the 11 age groups of the DTG players. The RAE was significantly lower in the FTG compared to the DTG and EG groups (Mann-Whitney U test, p < .05). There were no differences in playing minutes between players born in the first half of the year or in the second half of the year. These findings suggest that the RAE in elite clubs originates fundamentally in the talent selection process in all categories, but mainly in the youngest ones, and is maintained in all the lower categories, influencing the chances of making a first-team debut. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR El objetivo de estudio fue analizar el efecto de la edad relativa (RAE) en todas las categorías formativas de un club de fútbol profesional, e identificar si este afecta al tiempo de participación de los jugadores en competición y a sus posibilidades de debutar en el fútbol profesional. Se analizó la distribución de las fechas de nacimiento de 334 futbolistas de élite del Real Club Deportivo de la Coruña: 195 jugadores en edades de formación (GCI) divididos en 11 subgrupos correspondientes a sus categorías de edad (U9-U23), 110 jugadores profesionales (GPE) y 29 jugadores que debutaron en partido oficial con el primer equipo del club desde de las categorías inferiores (GE). Se calculó la suma de todos los minutos disputados por un futbolista en competición oficial durante una temporada. Los resultados del test ji cuadrado demostraron la existencia de RAE en los 3 grupos de jugadores analizados y en todos los subgrupos de edad de los jugadores del GCI. El RAE fue significativamente menor en el GPE en comparación con los grupos GCI y GE (Mann--Whitney U-test, p < .05). No se encontraron diferencias en el número de minutos disputados en función del semestre de nacimiento. Estos hallazgos sugieren que en los equipos de élite el RAE se origina fundamentalmente en el proceso de detección de talentos de todas las etapas, pero sobre todo de las de los más pequeños, y se mantiene a lo largo de todas las categorías inferiores, influyendo en las posibilidades de debutar con el primer equipo.

METHODS: Youth players 11 (n = 62, born 1992, observed December 2003) and 13 (n = 50, born 1990, observed April 2004) years were grouped by BQ. Baseline data included stature, weight, maturity status, functional capacities, soccer skills, goal orientation, and coach evaluation of potential. Playing status in soccer in 2006 and 2014 was also available. Baseline characteristics and subsequent playing status were compared by BQ. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics did not differ by BQ except for age and percentage of predicted adult height. Though not significant, coaches tended to rate players in BQ1as higher in potential. For those competing in soccer as adults, BQ2 (4), BQ3 (5) and BQ4 (2) were represented among players11 years, and BQ1 (3), BQ2 (2), BQ3 (1) and BQ4 (4) among players 13 years. CONCLUSION: Although limited to small numbers, differences among players by BQ were inconsistent. The results indicate a need to extend potential explanations of the RAE to include behavioral variables, coaches, training environment, and perhaps the culture of the sport.","2019","2020-05-20 00:40:52","2020-05-20 00:40:52","","677-684","","6","37","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02640414.2018.1522703; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L626100163","human; male; soccer; adolescent; body weight; child; age; body height; athletic performance; youth sport","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In a sample of 18,898 football players born on or after 1940, there is an excess of January and February births – consistent with a relative age effect associated with calendar year – as well as a slight increase in September births – consistent with the fact that some football players we analyze attended high school in states with fall school cutoff dates. We consider the possibility that relative age effects may affect skilled football positions more than positions relying heavily on player weight, and we find suggestive evidence of this. Lastly, and contrary to what has recently been shown in professional hockey, we find no evidence that misguided preferences for relatively older players lead to selection-based inefficiencies in football player drafting. Our results have implications for evaluating potential football players and speak broadly to the role of physiological factors beyond player control on athletic success.

Birth dates of 426 players from Under 9 to First Team were categorised into four birth quartiles (Q) and examined for relative age effects. Additionally, data on 382 players (Under 11 to First Team) were obtained for somatic maturity, anthropometry, countermovement jump, sprint (10 and 30 m), agility T-test and Yo-Yo Intermittent Recovery Level 1 or 2 performance to determine between-quartile differences. Odds ratios revealed Q1 players were 6.0 times more likely to be represented than Q4 players. Multilevel modelling demonstrated between birth quartile similarities for each variable across all age groups, though there was a tendency for Q4 players to outperform Q1 players between Under 11 and Under 18 groups. Strong relative age effects exist within this club as well as a tendency to select players demonstrating advanced growth and/or maturity, with some indication that higher categorised academies in England may be at risk of amplified selection biases. Talent identification strategies in elite youth football should actively seek to adopt novel approaches to reduce selection biases and avoid wasted potential.

The aim of our study was to assess the within-session relative and absolute reliability of participants’ performance of the modified SEBT (mSEBT) using a single practice trial in healthy elite athletes who were familiar with the test. Methods: An intra-session repeated-measures design was used to investigate the relative and absolute reliability of participants’ (healthy athletes partaking in sports at a high-risk of ankle sprain injury) performance of the mSEBT. A total of 122 healthy elite athletes from soccer (n = 73), basketball (n = 15), and volleyball (n = 34) performed one practice trial and three test trials within one session, in three directions (anterior, postero-medial, and postero-lateral), for both legs. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), standard error of measurement (SEM), and smallest detectable change at a 95% confidence were calculated. Results: We found a good to excellent relative within-session intra-rater reliability between the three trials on specified directions, with an ICC (3,1) from 0.90 to 0.95. SEM and SDC95 for normalized and composite scores, for both legs ranged from 0.91 to 2.86, and 2.54 to 7.94, respectively. Conclusions: In conclusion, we report good to excellent within-session reliability for the mSEBT. Our results confirm that the test can be reliably used with only one practice trial in healthy elite athletes familiar with the test.","2019","2020-05-20 00:40:58","2020-05-20 00:40:58","","","","6","2019","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.6999; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629674225","adult; female; human; human experiment; male; article; elite athlete; soccer; basketball; young adult; leg; normal human; volleyball; measurement error; task performance; high risk population; ankle sprain; intrarater reliability; Star Excursion Balance Test","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of this study was to determine preseason to postseason changes in WM integrity from repetitive head impacts for youth football (YFB) players compared with HS football players during a competitive football season. DESIGN: Prospective cohort. SETTING: One season of YFB (grades 7 and 8) and varsity HS football (grades 10-12). PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: Twelve YFB (13.08 ± 0.64 years) and 21 HS (17.5 ± 0.78 years) athletes. INTERVENTIONS: Participants completed 2 magnetic resonance imaging sessions: preseason and postseason. Head impact exposure was recorded during practice and games using a helmet-mounted accelerometer. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Tract-based spatial statistics were used to evaluate group differences in preseason to postseason changes in diffusion tensor imaging, including fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD). RESULTS: The HS group exhibited significant preseason to postseason reductions in MD, AD, and RD (P < 0.05, corrected) in widespread WM areas. Significant WM reductions for the YFB group were only observed for AD (P < 0.05, corrected), but was more limited in extent compared with HS. CONCLUSIONS: Significant preseason to postseason AD reduction was found in both YFB and HS groups after one season of competitive play. Our results did not confirm recent speculation that younger children are more susceptible to the deleterious effects of repetitive head impacts compared with their older counterparts.","2019","2020-05-20 00:41:00","2020-05-20 00:41:00","","442-450","","6","29","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/JSM.0000000000000753; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629766256","human; football; diagnostic imaging; injury; prospective study; adolescent; physiology; child; head injury; age; competitive behavior; diffusion tensor imaging; pathology; white matter; comparative study; pilot study; time factor","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To understand how helmets provide head protection, quantification of the relative motion between the head and the helmet is necessary. The purpose of this study was to compare helmet and head kinematics and quantify the relative motion of helmet with respect to head during experimental representations of on-field American football impact scenarios. Seven helmet-To-helmet impact configurations were simulated by propelling helmeted crash test dummies into each other. Head and helmet kinematics were measured with instrumentation and an optical motion capture system. The analysis of results, from 10 ms prior to the helmet contact to 20 ms after the loss of helmet contact, showed that the helmets translated 12-41 mm and rotated up to 37 deg with respect to the head. The peak resultant linear acceleration of the helmet was about 2-5 times higher than the head. The peak resultant angular velocity of the helmet ranged from 37% less to 71% more than the head, depending on the impact conditions. The results of this study demonstrate that the kinematics of the head and the helmet are noticeably different and that the helmet rotates significantly with respect to the head during impacts. Therefore, capturing the helmet kinematics using a video motion tracking methodology is not sufficient to study the biomechanics of the head. Head motion must be measured independently of the helmet.","2019","2020-05-20 00:41:02","2020-05-20 00:41:02","","","","8","141","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1115/1.4043038; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L627560627","article; football; acceleration; helmet; velocity; simulation; kinematics; quantitative analysis; motion analysis system; head movement; crash test dummy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In a series of ballistic contractions of submaximal amplitudes, the RTD scaling factor (RTD-SF) represents the slope of the linear regression between achieved peak torques and the corresponding RTD. First we investigated whether the RTD-SF contributes to the prediction, together with maximal voluntary torques (MVT), of the RTDmaximal. Then, we evaluated the agreement between the z-scores of RTDmaximal and RTDsubmaximal. APPROACH: The MVT was obtained for the quadriceps and hamstrings muscles of 22 elite young soccer players. RTD-SF was quantified in a series of ballistic contractions of submaximal and maximal amplitudes. RTDsubmaximal was estimated from the regression relationship between the peak torques and the corresponding RTD. MAIN RESULTS: MVT, RTD-SF and y -intercept in total accounted for 76.9 and 61.2% of the variance in RTDmaximal in quadriceps and hamstrings, respectively. Specifically, RTD-SF accounted for 13.7% and 18.7% of the variance in RTDmaximal, respectively. Generally, the agreement between the z-scores of RTDmaximal and RTDsubmaximal was poor both in quadriceps and hamstrings. SIGNIFICANCE: These results suggest that RTD-SF may have a functional relevance in the relationship between MVT and RTDmaximal and influence the amount of torque that can be achieved in a quick muscle contraction. Moreover, evaluating the RTDsubmaximal does not provide results that are interchangeable with RTDmaximal. Thus, evaluating the RTD across the whole range of torque could provide additional meaningful information about neuromuscular quickness.","2019","2020-05-20 00:41:04","2020-05-20 00:41:04","","025002","","2","40","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1361-6579/aaff24; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L626404521","female; human; male; biomechanics; adolescent; physiology; muscle contraction; torque; quadriceps femoris muscle","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A reliable and clinically practical gait balance control assessment leveraging similar kinematic measures is necessary to improve concussion assessment and management. Research question: Can peak accelerations collected during a dual-task (DT)gait assessment from a single low back placed accelerometer be measured reliably on different days, by different raters, in different environments, and be practically applied in a Division One (D1)athletics program? Methods: A single accelerometer placed on the low back over the L5 vertebra was utilized with a DT gait analysis protocol. Twenty (10 F)healthy participants performed the assessment in a laboratory and non-laboratory environment, on two separate days, and with two different raters. Eight gait event specific peak accelerations along three orthogonal axes were collected. In addition, data were collected from a cohort of 14 D1 female soccer players during a single assessment to explore the practical clinical application. Results: Cronbach's α values for the eight metrics ranged from 0.881 to 0.980 and ICC values from 0.868 to 0.987. Average assessment time for the 14 D1 female athletes was 8.50 ± 0.58 min, and significant differences between walking conditions were identified for Vert Accel 1 (p <.01), Vert Accel 2 (p =.01), and A-P Accel (p <.01). Significance: High Cronbach's α and ICC values coupled with a short assessment time and sensitivity to differences in gait balance control indicate our testing apparatus and protocol are both reliable and clinically practical. Additionally, gait event specific peak accelerations from a single accelerometer can detect subtle changes in gait balance control and may facilitate improvements in sport-related concussion diagnosis and return to activity decision making.","2019","2020-05-20 00:41:07","2020-05-20 00:41:07","","279-283","","","71","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gaitpost.2019.05.014; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2001990847","adult; female; human; human experiment; male; article; soccer player; sport injury; acceleration; priority journal; accelerometer; sport; cohort analysis; young adult; walking; normal human; reliability; kinematics; body equilibrium; gait; mass; dual-task performance (test); fifth lumbar vertebra","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Materials and methods: A total of 60 female football players (U-16 and U-18) performed bilateral and unilateral countermovement jump tests, a single leg hop test, a 40-m linear speed test, and two CODA tests on two occasions separated by 5–7 days to assess test-retest reliability. Furthermore, test sensitivity was also calculated. Finally, 52 players performed each test three times throughout the season to analyse those performance changes. Results: Reliability scores showed a priori acceptable values in U-16 (ICC = 0.76–0.94; CV = 1.0–4.8%) and U-18 (ICC = 0.75–0.99; CV = 1.0–3.6%) in all tests. All tests were sensitive to detect large changes at both short- and mid-term with the exception of the V-cut test (only at short-tem) in both groups. Seasonal changes were mainly produced between baseline and Test 3 in linear sprinting and jumping measurements in U-16 and U-18, respectively. Conclusions: Jumping, linear sprinting and CODA tests are reliable and can detect moderate to large performance changes and they could be used to monitor their performance in U-16 and U-18 female football players.

METHODS: Thirty-six futsal players with different levels of experience were recruited and divided into 2 groups (elite and nonelite). Players participated in 4 sessions (at least 7 d apart): (1) familiarization session, (2) anaerobic power (Wingate test), (3) FSPT trial 1, and (4) FSPT trial 2. The FSPT was carried out on a futsal court (wooden sprung floor) and skills such as dribbling, rotation, long and short passing, and shooting were examined. Content validity was assessed by 6 experienced futsal coaches and instructors. RESULTS: There was a significant correlation between FSPT and various aspects of anaerobic power (r = .5-.91; P ≤ .001). Moreover, significant large correlations were observed between test and retest of FSPT (r = .77; 95% confidence interval [CI], .56-.98; P ≤ .001). All instructors and coaches confirmed the content validity. There was high interrater reliability of the FSPT (r = .89; 95% CI, .85-.93; P < .001). FSPT total time (P = .001), penalty time (P = .022), and performance time (P = .001) were superior in elite relative to nonelite players. Anaerobic power was greater in elite players (P < .001). CONCLUSION: The results support the use of the FSPT to assess futsal players' performance in conjunction with skill and anaerobic fitness.","2019","2020-05-20 00:41:10","2020-05-20 00:41:10","","1096-1102","","8","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1123/ijspp.2018-0850; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629224687","adult; human; male; soccer; athlete; young adult; exercise test; fitness; athletic performance; reproducibility; validation study; anaerobic growth","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Consequently, several testing protocols are used to assess this component. This study assessed the test–retest reliability of a modified 505 test (M505) and the change-of-direction deficit (CODD) in elite youth football players. Data were collected from 110 players from the Under [u] 12–18 years age groups (u18 n = 26, u16 n = 26, u14 n = 39, u12 n = 19) within two English Premier League Category 1 Football Academies. Players completed the M505 twice in 7-days, and a 10-m sprint test for CODD calculation. Reliability was assessed with respect to chronological and biological age (according to PHV status). Typical error (%), minimal detectable change (MDC) (%) and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were calculated. Typical errors in M505 were moderate to large (2.0–3.2%), while ICCs ranged from low to high (r = 0.26–0.82). Typical errors in CODD were moderate to large (7.1–12.0%), with low to high ICC's (r = 0.19–0.79). MDC's were 5.5 to 8.9% in M505 and 17.7 to 33.3% in CODD. The typical errors and MDC's observed indicate that the M505 and CODD tests have limited practical utility in elite youth football players.

Measures of absolute heart rate (bpm) and relative HR (%HRmax) were obtained at the 3rd and 6th min of the test, with measures relative to the end HR (%HRend) 10, 20, 30, 60, 90, and 180 s, during the 3-min passive recovery. Variability in HR measures were assessed across successive trials (trial 1 vs. 2 and trial 2 vs. 3) and across all three trials, using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), coefficient of variation (CV) and typical error (TE). Results: HR measures obtained during the 6-min Yo-Yo IR1 test displayed good levels of reliability (ICC: 0.95-0.98, CV: 1.1-1.3% and TE: 0.96-2.44). Results, display a potential learning effect, with lower levels of variability between trial 2 and trial 3. Examination of %HRend obtained during the passive 3-min recovery demonstrated an increased variance, as the passive-recovery period progressed. Conclusion: The 6-min Yo-Yo IR1 test presents a novel and potentially practical approach to regularly assessing youth soccer players' physical response to intermittent exercise. Practitioners and researchers should, however, consider the need for appropriate familiarisation when undertaking this test.

The reliability of potential fatigue-monitoring measures in elite youth soccer players. J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2019-Monitoring fatigue is of vital importance to practitioners; however, logistics and concerns about reliability may impede the use of certain measures. This study aimed to quantify the reliability of potential measures of fatigue; a subjective wellness questionnaire, jump performance tests, and tri-axial accelerometer variables derived during submaximal shuttle running in elite youth soccer players. A secondary aim was to establish the minimum test duration that could be used for the submaximal shuttle run while maintaining good reliability. Seventeen male youth team players (age: 17.4 ± 0.5 years) were assessed on 2 occasions, spaced 7 days apart. Typical error, coefficient of variation (CV%), interclass correlation (ICC), and minimum detectable change were calculated for a subjective wellness questionnaire, countermovement jump (CMJ), squat jump (SJ) and drop jump contact time (DJ-CT), drop jump height (DJ-JH), and reactive strength (DJ-RSI). A novel submaximal shuttle running test was also used to assess tri-axial accelerometer data reliability. Results suggest that CMJ, SJ, DJ-CT, and DJ-RSI have good test-retest reliability (CV% = 4.5-7.7; ICC = 0.80-0.88); however DJ-JH did not show acceptable reliability (CV% = 6.0; ICC = 0.76). Good reliability was found for all tri-axial accelerometer variables during a 3-minute (2-minute analysis) submaximal shuttle run (CV% = 2.4-8.0; ICC = 0.81-0.95), except for % PlayerLoad anterior-posterior (%PLAP) (CV% = 7.2; ICC = 0.63). The subjective wellness questionnaire demonstrated poor reliability for all items (CV% = 11.2-30.0; ICC = 0.00-0.78). The findings from this study provide practitioners with valuable information about the reliability of a range of potential fatigue-monitoring measures. This can be used to help make accurate decisions about the magnitude of change in these assessments when used in practice.","2019","2020-05-20 00:41:22","2020-05-20 00:41:22","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1519/JSC.0000000000003317; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629262852","human; male; article; soccer player; controlled study; accelerometer; performance; adolescent; running; questionnaire; juvenile; fatigue; physician; minimum detectable change; contact time; quantitative analysis; test retest reliability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The two primary sources of concussion history are medically diagnosed concussions and athlete selfrecall. The accuracy and reliability of self-reported concussion history in rugby players is poorly quantified. Aim: To assess the accuracy of self-reported concussion histories in current professional rugby players by comparing the agreement between retrospective player-recalled and medically diagnosed concussion history. The re-test reliability of the concussion tool used will also be assessed. Methods: The National Institute of Health (NIH) Concussion Questionnaire was administered to the players to ascertain retrospective self-reported concussions sustained during their lifetime and specifically during their careers with the host professional rugby club. Retrospective information was compared with prospective injury surveillance data for the past 9 years. Clinical documentation that tracked all medically diagnosed concussions at the host institution from 2008-2017 was cross-matched with player recalled data. Cohens Kappa coefficient (k) was used to assess agreement between selfreported and clinically diagnosed concussions. The same questionnaire was readministered six months later to a subset (n = 20) of the cohort. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to assess the re-test reliability of the NIH Concussion Questionnaire. Results: Sixty-two male rugby players, mean [SD] age 25.39 [4.36] years participated in this study. Sixty-five percent of players (n = 40) reported ≥1 concussion. Player self-reported and medically diagnosed concussion histories had a 'fair' level of agreement (k = 0.319; [SE 0.76), p = 0.000). 58/64 self-recalled concussions were confirmed by medical diagnosis (91%). 34/92 diagnosed concussions were not selfreported (37%). The test re-test reliability of the NIH concussion history tool was moderate (ICC = 0.70; 95% CI 0.38-0.87). Conclusions: Agreement between player recalled and medically diagnosed concussion histories was found to be fair. The re-test reliability of the NIH concussion history questionnaire was moderate. In light of these results, there is need for improvements in concussion history assessment tools.","2019","2020-05-20 00:41:24","2020-05-20 00:41:24","","A109-A110","","13","36","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2019.29100.abstracts; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628868693","adult; conference abstract; human; male; rugby; clinical article; controlled study; athlete; concussion; questionnaire; retrospective study; validity; career; correlation coefficient; test retest reliability; documentation; kappa statistics; national health organization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: A total of 148 individual match observations were undertaken on 107 outfield players in competitive international matches, using a computerised tracking system (STATS, Leeds, England). High-speed activity was classified as either sprint activity (SA) (>25.1 km h-1) or high-speed running (HSR) (>19.8 km h-1). Repeated sprint activity (RSA) was defined as a minimum of two sprints with < 20 s recovery between sprints and repeated high-speed activity (RHSA) was defined as a minimum of two high-speed runs or sprints with < 20 s recovery between efforts. Results: HSR bouts occurred ~5 times more frequently than SA bouts. Central defenders (CD) completed ~50–80 fewer HSR bouts (moderate count ratio (CR): range 0.61–0.70) and ~10–20 fewer SA bouts (moderate CR: range 0.53–0.69) than all other playing positions. RSA bouts occurred less frequently than RHSA bouts (33 ± 10 vs. 1.1 ± 1.1).Conclusion: Consideration of both RHSA and RSA bouts is necessary to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the demands of female match play. Practitioners can utilise this information to construct position-specific training and testing programmes.

Repeated linear and quadrangular sprint as a function of anaerobic power. J Strength Cond Res 33(8): 2177-2184, 2019-This investigation aims to study in U17 soccer players the relationships among performance indices of linear or quadrangular (square shape) repeated-sprint bouts (RSBs) and leg muscular power measured with the Wingate test and the squat jump. Seventeen athletes were recruited. Participants were 16 ± 0.35 years old and had a body mass of 66.5 ± 8.69 kg and a height of 175 ± 0.05 cm. All participants performed linear or quadrangular RSBs, the Wingate test, and a vertical jump test. The mean fast linear sprint time was strongly correlated (p < 0.01) with the force and power measured with the vertical jump test (r = -0.68 and -0.75, respectively), whereas the mean linear RSB was weakly correlated with the peak power and fatigue index measured by the Wingate test (r = -0.54 and -0.56, respectively). There was a correlation between quadrangular RSBs performance indices and both Wingate and vertical jump parameters. In addition, there were no correlations (p > 0.05) between indices of the linear RSBs (decrement index, average, and fastest times) and quadrangular RSBs. Moreover, physiological and perceptual responses were significantly higher (p < 0.01) with quadrangular RSBs compared with linear RSBs. These results indicate that the Wingate test and the vertical jump test can be used as a substitute for repeated-sprint performance time. Finally, however, the repeated sprints with or without direction changes are 2 different motor abilities that should be trained independently of one another.","2019","2020-05-20 00:41:28","2020-05-20 00:41:28","","2177-2184","","8","33","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1519/JSC.0000000000002358; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628925656","human; male; soccer; adolescent; athlete; physiology; running; muscle strength; exercise test; athletic performance; skeletal muscle; body position","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Players completed an RSA test (7 × 30 m) with a 20-s recovery between sprints. The muscular response to an electrical stimulus before and after the test of both the biceps femoris (BF) and the rectus femoris (RF) were evaluated using tensiomyography. A two-way ANOVA was used to analyse the differences in RSA parameters in each of the four distance-intervals (0–5; 5–25; 25–30; 0–30 m) between sprint and age category. The U14 age category (5.30 ± 0.30 s) showed higher mean sprint times than U16 (4.62 ± 0.20 s) and U18 (4.46 ± 0.17 s) throughout the entire test (p < 0.01). U16 players revealed a worse best sprints time (RSABEST) than U18 players (+0.12 s, CI95%: to 0.01 to 0.24; ES: 1.09, p = 0.03). The muscular contractile properties were similar in the three age categories analyzed (p > 0.05), although the delay time (Td) of the muscle was significantly lower after the RSA test in U16 players (−1.53 ms, CI95%: −2.607 to −0.452; ES: 0.38) and U18 players (−1.11 ms, CI95%: −2.10 to −0.12; ES: 0.22). In conclusion, this study revealed an increase in physical performance and muscle response variability after a repeated sprint ability test in the U16's and over. The fatigue induced by the RSA test did not show differences depending on the age of the players, although muscle mechanical properties were altered after the RSA test in U16 and U18 soccer players. Physical performance and muscle response can be complementary variables in managing fatigue according to the age category in soccer players.","2019","2020-05-20 00:41:32","2020-05-20 00:41:32","","","","MAR","10","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2019.00175; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L627944747","human; article; soccer player; physical performance; adolescent; muscle contraction; muscle function; rectus femoris muscle; fatigue; age; biceps femoris muscle; functional assessment; electrostimulation; muscle response; myography; repeated sprint ability; Repeated Sprint Ability test; tensiomyography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The study involved 30 football players from two ranks of competition (15 football players from the first rank of the competition and 15 football players from the third rank of the competition). The RSA test consisted of 6 sprints at a distance of 30 meters with an active rest between two sprints of 20 seconds. Total sprint time and average sprint time were calculated for all subjects in both groups. In addition to the total and average sprint time, a percentage decline in sprint performance was calculated. The results of the study showed a significant decline in the performance of sprint repetition in both groups of subjects. The sprint speed of all six reps was significantly higher for Division 1 football players, as shown by the times gained at a distance of 30 meters. In addition, Division 1 football players had a statistically better total and average sprint time compared to Division 3 players (p <0.01). The only performance parameter in which the players of different competition rank did not differ was the percentage decline in performance (p> 0.05). The conclusion is that professional football players have a better developed ability to repeat sprints than amateurs, which confirms the previously proven role of this ability in modern football.

The sample was composed of 197 male players aged 13-14 years. Body mass, stature, and sitting height were measured, RSA was assessed in the field, and age at peak height velocity (APHV) was predicted. Factorial ANOVA tested the independent and combined effects of RAE given by birth quarters (BQs) and maturity status on dependent variables. Players born in the second birth quarter (BQ2) were significantly taller (F = 4.28, p < 0.01) than their peers born in BQ1 and BQ3. Additionally, players born in BQ2 performed better than players born in BQ4 in RSA total time and ideal time (F ranged between 4.81 and 4.90, p < 0.01), while players born in BQ1 exhibited a lower RSA fatigue index compared to those born in BQ4 (F = 2.90, p < 0.05). The interaction of the BQ and maturity status was a significant source of inter-individual variation for body size (F ranged between 64.92 and 105.57; p < 0.01) and RSA output (F ranged between 4.082 and 6.76; p < 0.05). In summary, being relatively older and, simultaneously, advanced in maturity status corresponds to a substantial advantage in characteristics that are related to soccer-specific fitness.

J Strength Cond Res 33(5): 1 3 6 2 -1 3 7 0 , 2 0 1 9 - Repeated-sprint ability (RSA) in essential for soccer. Important considerations when assessing RSA is whether there are d ifferences between positions (defenders, midfielders, and fo rwards), and what physiological characteristics may contribute to RSA. This has not been assessed in collegiate male players. Eighteen Division I male field players from one school performed several performance tests. The RSA test involved 7 X 30-m sprints completed on 20-second cycles. Measurements included total time (TT), and performance decrement (percent change in time from the first to last sprint; PD). Subjec ts also completed tests of lower-body power (vertical [VJ] and standing broad jump [SBJ]); linear (30-m sprint; 0 - 5 m, 0 -1 0 m, 0 -3 0 m intervals) and change-of-direction (505) speed; and soccer-specific endurance (Yo-Yo Intermittent Recovery Test Level 2; YYIRT2). A one-way analysis of variance (p < 0.05) determined between-position differences, and effect sizes were calculated. Pearson's correlations (p < 0.05) calculated relationships between RSA TT and PD with the other tests. There were no significant between-position differences for any test. There were large effects for the faster rightleg 50 5 and greater YYIRT2 distance for midfielders compared with defenders and forwards. Nonetheless, no between-position differences in RSA TT and PD were documented. There were relationships between RSA TT and the VJ (r = -0 .5 9 ) , SBJ (r= -0 .6 1 ) , 0 -1 0 m ( r= 0.64) and 0 -3 0 -m (r = 0.83) sprint intervals. There were no significant correlations for RSA PD. Male field players from one collegiate soccer team can demonstrate similar RSA across different positions. Greater lower-body power and sprinting speed could augment RSA.

In an attempt to limit repetitive head impact exposure during the football preseason, the NCAA eliminated two-a-day practices in 2017, while maintaining the total number of team practice sessions. The objective of this study was to quantify head impact exposure during the preseason and regular season in Division I college football athletes to determine whether the 2017 NCAA ruling decreased head impact exposure. 342 unique athletes from five NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) programs were consented and enrolled. Head impacts were recorded using the Head Impact Telemetry (HIT) System during the entire fall preseasons and regular seasons in 2016 and 2017. Despite the elimination of two-a-day practices, the number of preseason contact days increased in 2017, with an increase in average hourly impact exposure (i.e., contact intensity), resulting in a significant increase in total head impact burden (+ 26%) for the 2017 preseason. This finding would indicate that the 2017 NCAA ruling was not effective at reducing the head impact burden during the football preseason. Additionally, athletes sustained a significantly higher number of recorded head impacts per week (+ 40%) during the preseason than the regular season, implicating the preseason as a time of elevated repetitive head impact burden. With increased recognition of a possible association between repetitive head impact exposure and concussion, increased preseason exposure may predispose certain athletes to a higher risk of concussion during the preseason and regular season. Accordingly, efforts at reducing concussion incidence in contact sports should include a reduction in overall head impact exposure.","2019","2020-05-20 00:41:42","2020-05-20 00:41:42","","2073-2085","","10","47","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002702858; http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10439-019-02335-9","football player; human; article; football; brain concussion; priority journal; controlled study; incidence; accelerometer; student athlete; disease burden; occupational exposure; disease predisposition; high risk population; trend study; telemetry","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of the study was to report on the 2nd U21 European Deaf Football Championship, analyse selected offensive actions and compare them with the 1st European Deaf Sports Organization (EDSO) U21 Championship and Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) U21 events (2015 and 2017), as well as create a ranking of finalists of the deaf U21 tournaments. Methods. Counting analyses were performed on the basis of video recordings from the stadiums of 1st and 2nd EDSO U21. Nineteen matches were analysed with reference to the number of goals, shots on target, and shots missed. Results. The mean number of goals scored per match during the 2nd U21 (1st U21) Championship was 2.25 ± 2.27/team (1.81 ± 1.53). The number of shots on target and missed was 8.1 ± 5.7/team/match (6.9 ± 4.9) and 6.2 ± 3.9/team/match (5.4 ± 3.7). In 1st and 2nd EDSO Championships, the most offensive play was presented by the teams of Turkey, Poland, Russia, and Ukraine. Conclusions. The winner of the tournament was the team with the highest shooting efficiency and the highest number of crosses in all matches. The analyses of the 2nd U21 can be useful for the organization of coaching. Organizers of events for deaf athletes, however, do not pay much attention to careful registration of the event materials and match statistics, which are very important for the promotion of events for deaf athletes.

The fast pace of the attack and defense and the fierce confrontation require the higher physical fitness of the athletes. The competition strategies, tactics and the football concepts are diversified. The characteristics of the current world football are the outstanding integrity, the comprehensive technologies, the high-intensity confrontation, and the abundant physical strength, and the formation tends to be more conducive to the balance of the attack and defense. The intelligent tactical analysis has become a trend by using the advanced algorithms and technologies such as the machine learning and the pattern recognition. The wide application of the systems such as SportVU and the intelligent technologies makes it possible for the above-mentioned statistics of the primary data based on the football matches, and has the strong data support for the tactical selection in any specific situation. Methods : The OPTA's real-time statistics system is this artificial + intelligent way. Each recording group has three people, with two people for the real-time data acquisition and one person for the real-time video material playback verification. Some may question the accuracy of this artificial method. In fact, the competition data given by different companies are indeed different, and behind each company's data collection there is a unique philosophy. Artificial + intelligent data acquisition method can be said to be the eight immortals across the sea show their magic power, and the calculation method of the statistical indicators will also affect the final statistical results. Combined with the introduction of the above collection methods, we can roughly know that the statistical methods of the shooting, the corner kick, the free kick, the penalty and the foul are one word: number. In terms of this kind of events, the recorder has a long time to reflect what happened on the court, and the possibility of errors is relatively small. The possession rate is also an easy indicator to record. The possession rate is equal to the possession time/the total possession time of both teams, and the possession time is the time before the passing ball is not touched by the other team. The machines can record which team takes the ball and how long it takes. It only needs some simple modifications, such as eliminating the dead ball time (celebration time, corner kick, and free kick time), to get the ball control rate. Similarly, the success rate of passing = the number of successful passes / the total number of passes of the team. In fact, it is the number of times that have not been stolen. The same is the way that the machine and the manual collection, but the manual verification is carried out for the statistics. The big data and the advanced technologies based on the data will bring profound changes to the training, recovery, technical and tactical arrangement and operation and development of the competitive sports. Audiences can independently carry out the data statistics and checks, which puts forward higher requirements for the real-time data statistics of the broadcasting companies, to be more accurate and timelier. The football statistics during this period still rely on the manual work. With the development of the computer technologies, the computer has become a professional statistical assistant tool. The professional statisticians will turn every action on the court into an event, and store all kinds of the high-density actions more than 30 times per minute into the events, which will be verified manually and released in the real time through the program. This method requires a lot of the manual work, so it has a high accuracy. Conclusions : Through the interpretation of the development trend of football in the world today, the team relies on the overall tactics more than the individual stars to win. The fast pace of the attack and defense and the fierce c nfrontation require the higher physical fitness of the athletes.

Each ant is regarded as a robot. The ant adjusts its direction according to the pheromone, and quickly finds a shortest collision-free path through the information exchange and cooperation among ants. The test results show that the optimal algorithm can overcome the shortcomings of the local optimum and obtain the optimal path without collision, which meets the real-time requirements of the football path planning. Methods: TA good path planning algorithm can effectively improve the motion ability of the robots, so that the robots can move safely and efficiently. Image signal acquisition and processing based on the optimal algorithm combination. In the main control part of the target detection, the real-time image acquisition is carried out by controlling the CCD. The current frame is compared with the background image, and the image after the comparison is enhanced, filtered and extracted. Finally, the judgment results are given. If the target is a person, an early warning procedure is initiated. On the contrary, it will continue to judge. Results: The gridding method divides the robot's motion space into a series of the simple regular regions. If there are no obstacles in a gridding area, it is called the free gridding, and otherwise, it is called the barrier gridding. The lattice method is to search the connected graph composed of lattices to find a feasible route between the starting point and the target point. By combining with other methods, the performance of the grid method is further optimized, so that it can be better used in the path planning problem. Based on the practical experience of walking in the crowd, the environmental model is established by using the grid method, which successfully solves the path planning problem of the football simulation. Conclusions: The football simulation system recognizes the football field images captured by the camera through the image processing program of the host computer, so as to obtain the environmental information, and send the information to the decision-making subsystem through the network. The decision-making system determines the next action of the football simulation based on the environmental information. The robot car is sent by the wireless transmitter. After receiving the command, the car performs the corresponding operation, completes the planning and controls in the current cycle. The final result is transmitted back to the computer by the camera in the form of images, carries on the information feedback, and then enters the next cycle of operation.","2019","2020-05-20 00:41:51","2020-05-20 00:41:51","","127-128","","","125","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bcpt.13266; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628905960","adult; conference abstract; female; human; human experiment; male; football; motion; walking; decision making; simulation; image processing; robotics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Method: Eighteen professional rugby union athletes performed a 3-week resistance training intervention where they were randomly allocated into 2 groups: HEAT (n = 8) with all lower-body training sessions performed in an environmental chamber set at 35°C and 37% relative humidity, or CON (n = 10) where identical training was performed under temperate conditions (21°C and 45%). Pre- and post-training tests included measures of strength, power, endurance, speed and body mass. Results:Small effect sizes were found in favour of HEAT for the back squat (g = 0.25) and bench press strength (g = 0.22). All other measures were associated with trivial or unclear effects. A significant group × time interaction was found for body mass, associated with a trivial effect size (g = 0.18, HEAT +1.5 kg; CON −0.8 kg). Discussion: Lower body resistance training in the heat led to small improvements in lower and upper body strength compared to the identical training program performed in temperate conditions. This observation is suggestive of a priming or potentiating effect of prior training in the heat.

We tested the hypothesis that respiratory frequency (fR) is a marker of physical effort during soccer-related high-intensity exercise. METHODS: Twelve male soccer players performed a preliminary intermittent incremental test and two shuttle-run high-intensity interval training (HIIT) protocols, in separate visits. The two HIIT protocols consisted of 12 repetitions over 9 min and differed in the work-recovery ratio (15:30s vs. 30:15s). Work rate was self-paced by participants to achieve the longest possible total distance in each HIIT protocol. RESULTS: Work-phase average metabolic power was higher (P < 0.001) in the 15:30s (31.7 ± 3.0 W·kg-1) compared to the 30:15s (22.8 ± 2.0 W·kg-1). Unlike heart rate and V̇O2, fR showed a fast response to the work-recovery alternation during both HIIT protocols, resembling changes in metabolic power even at supramaximal intensities. Large correlations (P < 0.001) were observed between fR and rating of perceived exertion during both 15:30s (r = 0.87) and 30:15s (r = 0.85). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that fR is a good marker of physical effort during shuttle-run HIIT in soccer players. These findings have implications for monitoring training in soccer and other team sports.","2019","2020-05-20 00:41:56","2020-05-20 00:41:56","","1-24","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1123/ijspp.2019-0028; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L627620956","adult; human; human experiment; male; article; soccer player; heart rate; controlled study; team sport; monitoring; high intensity interval training; breathing rate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, studies have yet to consider the confounding effects of altered resting cerebral blood flow (CBF0) and cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) on changes in connectivity following sub-concussive impacts. Here, 23 Canadian collegiate football players were followed during a season using calibrated resting-state MRI and helmet accelerometers to examine the interplay between the neural and vascular factors that determine functional connectivity (FC). Connectivity-based analyses using blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption (CMRO2) mapping were used to study the DMN longitudinally. Network-specific decreases in CBF0 were observed one month following the season, while impaired CVR was documented at both mid-season and one month following the season, compared to pre-season baseline. Alterations in CBF0 and BOLD-based CVR throughout the season suggest that neurophysiological markers may show different susceptibility timelines following head impacts. DMN connectivity was increased throughout the season, independent of changes in cerebrovascular physiology, suggesting that alterations in FC following sub-concussive impacts are robust and independent of changes in brain hemodynamics. No significant correlations between impact kinematics and DMN connectivity changes were documented in this study. Altogether, these findings create a strong paradigm for future studies to examine the underlying neural and vascular mechanisms associated with increases in network connectivity following repeated exposure to sub-concussive collisions, in an effort to improve management of head impacts in contact sports.","2019","2020-05-20 00:42:00","2020-05-20 00:42:00","","","","","22","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nicl.2019.101753; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2001698047","adult; football player; human; male; article; sport injury; acceleration; brain; brain concussion; clinical article; priority journal; accelerometer; athlete; helmet; young adult; brain blood flow; head injury; kinematics; neuroimaging; cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen; functional magnetic resonance imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; oxygen; calibration; default mode network; brain blood vessel; functional connectivity; gForce Tracker; hemodynamic parameters; Magnetom Trio Tim; oxygen blood level","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: All professional football players undergoing surgery for isolated unstable syndesmosis injury (West Point grade ≥IIB) at a specialised Orthopaedic and Sports Medicine Hospital were followed up until return to play (minimum ≥6 months). Players with a stable syndesmosis, injuries older than 6 weeks, concomitant medial or lateral malleolar fracture or previous ankle surgery were excluded. During rehabilitation, time required to return to sports-specific rehabilitation, team training and first match play, were recorded. RESULTS: Between January 2012 and December 2017, a total of 110 male professional football players were included. The mean time required to begin on field rehabilitation was 37±12 days, while the mean time to return to team training was 72±28 days. The first official match was played on average 103±28 days postoperatively. Multivariable analysis revealed that the severity of injury, the concomitant presence of talar cartilage injury and the age of the player were significantly associated (p<0.00001) with time to return to on field rehabilitation, team training and match play. CONCLUSION: In this cohort of professional football players, surgical stabilisation of isolated unstable syndesmosis injuries (West Point grade ≥IIB) allowed for relatively quick return to play. High grade injury (West Point grade III), concomitant cartilage injury and greater age were associated with longer return to play times.

Predicting hamstring muscle injury and determining clinical or imaging consensus for safe return-to-play are challenging. With its potential to assist injury classification, management and prediction, use of the British Athletics Muscle Injury (BAMI) classification to inform precision rehabilitation may expedite time to return-to-play (TRTP) and reduce recurrence. To date, no research has assessed use of the BAMI classification in elite male professional football players. The objective was to evaluate use of the BAMI classification and its association with TRTP and recurrence rate following hamstring injury in elite male football players. Methods: An observational retrospective cohort study, using electronic medical record review data of male first-team players at Aston Villa Football Club across 6 competitive seasons took place in August 2017 according to a pre-defined study protocol. Players diagnosed with an acute hamstring injury who underwent MRI examination within 7 days of injury were included. Data extracted from electronic records included TRTP and recurrence rate. MRI images were independently evaluated and classified by 2 experienced musculoskeletal radiologists using the BAMI classification by grade (0–4) and location (a–c). Any differences between their classifications were resolved through discussion. Kruskal Wallis, Fisher's exact, and binary logistic regression enabled exploration of the relationships among variables. Ethical approval was obtained from the University of Birmingham. Results: 44 hamstring injuries were documented from 28 elite football players across the 6 seasons. The mean (SD) age of players was 25 (4.69) years. The mean (SD) TRTP following hamstring injury was 18.98 (15.58) days, with 8 cases of recurrence. There was a significant difference between BAMI classifications and TRTP (x2 = 12.272, p = 0.031), and in particular a significant difference in TRTP between classification location c (intradendinous) and no tendon involvement (t = −4.229, p < 0.01). No significant differences in TRTP were found between grade 1 and 2 injuries (t = −1.923, p = 0.063), or between classifications a (myofascial) and b (musculotendinous) (t = 1.969, p = 0.069). HMI recurrence was not concomitant with grade (p = 0.088) or classification (p = 0.208). Conclusion(s): The BAMI classification is a promising tool to categorise and predict TRTP after hamstring injuries in elite football. Higher BAMI grade is associated with increasing TRTP. Our data demonstrate that hamstring injuries extending into the tendon (c) are associated with longer TRTP. Moreover, we found significantly longer TRTP for lower grade intratendinous tears (i.e. 2c). Implications: A key strength of this study is its access to the elite environment. The tendon related hamstring injury information included in the BAMI classification appears clinically useful in categorising type of hamstring injury in elite football players. Recognition of this type of intramuscular tendon injury appears important and they may be less likely to respond to accelerated rehabilitation. Future research will investigate reasons for the frequency of this particular 2c injury site.

This study examines concussion effects on individual players in the Major League Soccer (MLS) and English Premier League (EPL) by assessing 1) return-to-play (RTP) time, 2) career length, and 3) performance. Methods: Contracts, transactions, injury reports, and performance statistics from 2008-17 were obtained from the official MLS and EPL online publications. Players who sustained a concussion were compared with the 2008-17 non-concussed player pool. Career length was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and athletes were stratified by player age, experience, and longevity. Player performance changes were evaluated between the years before versus after concussion. RTP and games missed were analyzed and compared. Results: Of the 1,784 eligible MLS and 2,001 eligible EPL players evaluated over the 10-year period, 102 MLS players sustained 165 concussions and 124 EPL players sustained 142 concussions resulting in injury protocol initiation. MLS players on average missed 7.5 games after a concussion, with 33.5 days missed, whereas EPL players on average missed 0.5 games after a concussion with 9.5 days missed, which was statistically different (p<0.001, p<0.0001). Performance was reduced at all non-goalie positions for goals and assists post-concussion for players in the MLS and in the EPL (p < 0.01). Concussed MLS players playing non-goalie positions scored 2.5 points/year less following a concussion and played in 20 fewer games/year on average. Concussed EPL players playing non-goalie positions scored 3.1 points/year less following a concussion and started in 5.8 fewer games/year on average. Concussed MLS and EPL goalies saw no significant change in performance, although EPL goalies played 3.2 additional games/year on average (p <0.05). The probability of playing a full season post-concussion was not significantly decreased compared with the non-concussed pool (p > 0.05) in both leagues Conclusion: This study investigating the short-term effects of concussion on professional soccer players demonstrates that performance is reduced for non-goalie players, without a significant difference in career longevity between concussed and non-concussed controls.","2019","2020-05-20 00:42:28","2020-05-20 00:42:28","","","","7","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2325967119S00340; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629239459","conference abstract; human; soccer player; controlled study; major clinical study; season; concussion; career; probability; Kaplan Meier method; longevity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this article, we examine the experiences of students and staff in an educational sport program at a Swedish all-male youth detention home (ages 16–20) in order to increase understanding of the pedagogical approach of a sports-based program for detained youth. Drawing on interviews with both students and staff, we identify and elaborate four aspects of the program—building a pedagogical platform, 'seeing' and meeting students, creating a supportive environment, and thinking beyond the institution—that were collectively represented to initiate and guide a process of growth and change for students. We discuss how these aspects of the program's pedagogical approach, in contrast to deficiency-based approaches, can provide a useful framework for delivering sport in ways that can benefit detained youth and other young people in socially vulnerable situations.

DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional study involving a postal questionnaire, followed by radiographic assessment in a subcohort of responders. SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS: Four thousand seven hundred seventy-five questionnaires were sent to retired professional footballers, who had played in the English football league, and 1207 responded. Of these, 470 underwent knee radiographs. ASSESSMENT OF RISK FACTORS: Potential factors include age, body mass index (BMI), knee alignment, a history of football-related knee injury, and training hours (during career) were collected through the questionnaire. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Knee osteoarthritis outcomes were current KP (pain for most days of the previous month), TKR (self-reported), and RKOA (observed through radiographs). RESULTS: Football-related injury was the strongest risk factor for KP [adjusted odds ratio (aOR), 4.22; 95% confidence interval (CI), 3.26-5.48], RKOA [aOR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.81-4.59], and TKR [aOR, 4.83; 95% CI, 2.87-8.13]. Footballers had a 7% increased risk of RKOA for every 1000 hours trained. Although age and gout were associated with all 3 KOA outcomes, BMI, nodal osteoarthritis (OA), a family history of OA, knee malalignment, and 2D:4D ratio were associated with one or another of these 3 KOA outcomes. CONCLUSION: This study is the first to examine KOA risk factors in retired professional footballers. The study has identified several risk factors, both specific (eg, knee injury and training dose) and nonspecific (eg, age and gout) to footballers. This may be used to develop prevention strategies to reduce the risk of KOA in professional footballers after retirement.This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License 4.0 (CCBY), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.","2019","2020-05-20 00:42:35","2020-05-20 00:42:35","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/JSM.0000000000000742; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628073524","adult; female; football player; human; male; article; case report; clinical article; body mass; questionnaire; cross-sectional study; career; knee injury; risk factor; clinical assessment; prevention; X ray film; knee pain; knee radiography; reproduction; family history; retirement; knee osteoarthritis; total knee arthroplasty; gout; licence; second-to-fourth digit ratio","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The study design was informed by Bronfenbrenner's ecological systems model of development and the methodology was case study. The participant in the study was the PDM who worked for one provincial rugby union and NZR. Data was gained using; interviews, document analysis and observations. An iterative strategy was employed when adopting the deductive and inductive analysis. The study found that across the NZR ecology there was no universal definition of character, or set of criteria used to assess players' character. Within the NZR macrosystem there were formal policies that explicitly identified character as a value to be assessed. Yet, implicit understandings and assessment of character also existed. The PDM working in a microsystem constructed his understanding and assessment of character based on his experiences working with, and for, NZR (macrosystem) and the PU (exosystem) respectively, as well as drawing on his personal value set. The findings of this study are significant not only for rugby, in New Zealand and elsewhere, but they are relevant and topical for any selector, recruitment agent or coach who implicitly and explicitly (de)selects participants based on character.

Introduction Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture is one of the most threatening injuries which occurs during sport activities, especially at high levels of performance. Screening methods to assess and understand neuromuscular behaviour after ACL injury and then the appropriate recovery, need to be developed to safeguard athletes’ when return to the on-field sport practice. Nowadays scientific literature identify the biomechanical analysis of the Single-Leg Drop Landing (SLDL) task as predictive of ACL injury [1,2], however very few studies investigated the role of muscle forces [3,4]. 2. Research Question The aim of this study is to verify the role plaid by lower limb (LL) and trunk muscle forces in the neuromuscular control of a group of elite athletes before and after ACL reconstruction. 3. Methods Thirteen male elite players (25.0 ± 7.5 yr, 23.55 ± 2.1 BMI) with no previous injuries and four male elite rugby players (24.5 ± 6.6 yr, 29.1 ± 4.0 BMI) with ACL injury were recruited and analysed before (BAR) and two six months after the ACL reconstruction (AAR). All participants signed an informed consent, then executed a static trial and 3 SLDL tasks from a box of 32-cm height onto a 3D force platform (Bertec FP2060, 960 Hz). A 3D motion capture systems (BTS, 6 cameras, 60-120 Hz) synchronized with two force plates and an 8-channel surface electromyography (sEMG) system (Free 1000 BTS, 1000 Hz) were adopted. Thirty reflective markers were applied according to [6], and the activity of Rectus Femoris, Biceps Femoris Caput Longus, Tibialis Anterior, Gastrocnemius Lateralis was recorded bilaterally. Muscle forces were determined through musculoskeletal modelling (MSM) in OpenSim, (model Gait 2392) [5–7]. The 2 seconds after the foot contact on the platform were considered [1–4] for the analysis. For validation purposes the peak of the envelope occurrence in OpenSim was compared with the experimentally measured sEMG [8]; the Wilcoxon test (p < 0.05) was used. Joint kinematics, kinetics, muscle forces of both the BAR and AAR groups were compared with those of the control group; the U-Mann-Whitney test (p < 0.05) was used. 4. Results Significant differences were observed (p < 0.05) between the muscle forces of the BAR or the AAR athletes and the control group (Fig.1). 5. Discussion Results of the current study support the hypothesis that muscle forces play an important role in highlighting impairments at the level of neuromuscular control in ACL injury athletes and can be used as guiding parameter for determining the optimal return on field time. Important limits should be outline: the small sample, the 1 DoF knee model available in Gait 2392 that was not subject specific in term of geometry derived from MRI, and EMG-driven muscle forces computation. Future analysis should be performed to overcome these limitations.

The study follows the importance of the implementation of proprioceptive training as a component part of the functional rehabilitation program, thus highlighting its beneficial effects: diminishing the symptoms, increasing joint mobility and muscle strength, regaining static and dynamic stability, essential parameters of sportsmen's reintegration. The following tests were applied to the subject: joint assessment, muscle testing, Single Leg Balance Test (SLB), Single Legged Hop Test (SLH), 6 Meter Timed Hop Test, Star Excursion Balance Test (SEBT) and evaluation of symptomatology and gait using The Foot and Ankle Disability Index (FADI) Score and Sports Module questionnaire. After applying the rehabilitation program, we found that the subject developed a significant improvement of the balance on unstable surfaces (trampoline, balance board), maintaining the position in unipodal support for a duration of 4 times greater than after the initial evaluation. Also, the speed of execution for the jumps forwards over the distance of 6 meters was improved, the time difference between testing with the healthy limb (4.39 seconds) and that with the affected limb (4.67 seconds) being below 10%. Therefore, we can conclude that the recovery program led to the elimination of joint instability, the results obtained representing essential indices of functional performance.

The accelerated phases were assessed for fat free mass, total body water, and upper muscle area, with a starting time point at approximately −2.00 years from peak at velocity (YPHV), and for body cell mass, whose developmental tempo sped up around −1.00 YPHV. An increase in the rate of development was also observed close to −2.00 YPHV for phase angle (PA), although without accelerated phases. From a CA point of view, significant slope changes were found for all BC and bioimpendance variables, except for the calf muscle area.

The running and technical performance of U13 to U18 elite Japanese soccer players during match play. J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2019-The aims of the current study were (a) to examine age-related differences in match running performance with 2 different approaches (speed vs. metabolic power) in U13-U18 Japanese elite soccer players and (b) to examine age-related differences in technical match performance in U13-U18 Japanese elite soccer players. Participants were 110 outfield players from academies of 2 professional soccer clubs in Japan. Forty-eight 11-a-side official league matches (13, 6, 9, 7, 6, and 7 matches for U13, U14, U15, U16, U17, and U18 age-groups, respectively) were analyzed (152 complete match files). Global positioning system (15 Hz) and video analysis were used to analyze running and technical performance during matches, respectively. Total distance covered in absolute terms (U13 < [U14 and U15] < [U16-U18]; p < 0.05 for all), high-intensity running distance ([U13-U15] < [U16-U18]; p < 0.05 for all), and distance covered during the metabolic power zone of ≥35 W·kg relative to match playing time ([U13 < U16], [U13-U15] < [U17 and U18]; p < 0.05 for all) increased with age. The speed zone based approach (high-intensity running distance, ≥4.0 m·s) underestimated high-intensity demands compared with the metabolic power zone based approach (≥20 W·kg) by ∼33 to ∼57% (p < 0.01 for all), with the underestimation declining with age (p < 0.001). Pass accuracy improved with age from 73% at U13 to 85% at U18 (p < 0.001). Therefore, distance covered at high speeds and at high metabolic powers, and pass accuracy increase with age. Moreover, the speed zone based approach underestimates the demands of match play in Japanese elite youth soccer players. The current results could support coaches to develop players, identify talent, and produce age-specific training programs.","2019","2020-05-20 00:42:56","2020-05-20 00:42:56","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1519/JSC.0000000000003300; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629262991","adult; human; article; soccer player; training; running; velocity; juvenile; global positioning system; groups by age; videorecording; Japan","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

OBJECTIVES: We studied the effects of different neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) currents, Russian current (RC) and Pulsed current (PC) on the neuromuscular system after a six-week training period. DESIGN: Blinded randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Laboratory. PATIENTS: Twenty-seven male soccer players (22.2±2.2 years, 74.2±10.0 kg, 177±0 cm, BMI: 23.7±2.9 kg/cm for the control group, 22.1±3.1 years, 69.7±5.7 kg, 174±0 cm, 23.0±2.5 kg/cm for the PC group, and 23.0±3.4 years, 72.1±10.7 kg,175±0 cm, 23.5±3.4 kg/cm for the RC group) were randomized into three groups: 1) control group, 2) RC (2500 Hz, burst 100 Hz, phase duration 200 μs), and 3) PC (100 Hz and 200 μs). Intervention: The experimental groups trained for six weeks, with three sessions per week with NMES. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) and evoked torque, muscle architecture, sensory discomfort (VAS), and electromyographic activity (EMG) were evaluated before and after the six-week period. RESULTS: Evoked torque increased in the RC (169.5±78.2 %, p<0.01) and PC groups (248.7±81.1 %, p<0.01). Muscle thickness and pennation angle increased in the RC (8.7±3.8 % and 16.7±9.0%, p<0.01) and PC groups (16.1±8.0 % and 27.4±11.0 %, p<0.01). The PC demonstrated lower values for VAS (38.8±17.1 %, p<0.01). There was no significant time difference for MVIC and RMS (root mean square) values (p>0.05). For all these variables, there was no difference between the RC and PC (p>0.05). CONCLUSION: Despite the widespread use of RC in clinical practice, RC and PC training programs produced similar neuromuscular adaptations in soccer players. Nonetheless, as PC generated less perceived discomfort it could be preferred after several training sessions.","2019","2020-05-20 00:42:59","2020-05-20 00:42:59","","1-25","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1123/jsr.2018-0314; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628140290","adult; human; male; article; soccer player; controlled study; training; body mass; randomized controlled trial; resistance training; physiotherapy; torque; muscle isometric contraction; single blind procedure; clinical practice; muscle thickness; neuromuscular electrical stimulation; neuromuscular system","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The limits and advantages of using saliva to define the systemic responses to exercise are examined, both in terms of data normalization and interpretation, and the time that the effect lasts in this biofluid, which is shorter to that commonly observed in blood. The heterogeneous nature and different timing of the exercise developed by players also plays an important role in the metabolic changes that can be measured. Our work focuses mainly on three different aspects: The effect that time sampling has on the observed effect, the type of normalization that is necessary to perform in order to cope with changes in water content, and the metabolic response that can be observed using saliva.","2019","2020-05-20 00:43:01","2020-05-20 00:43:01","","","","7","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/metabo9070141; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002248996","adult; female; human; article; soccer; exercise; young adult; lactic acid; biological marker; amino acid; glycine; alcohol; metabolism; saliva analysis; unclassified drug; energy; creatinine; urea; hydration; 5 aminopentanoate; acetoin; acetone; Avance; biomarker detection kit; chemical composition; dimethyl sulfone; ethanolamine; fumaric acid; galactose; glycerol; histidine; isocaproic acid; isoleucine; metabolome; methanol; nitrogen; nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer; o phosphocholine; ornithine; phenylalanine; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; putrescine; pyruvic acid; succinic acid; sucrose; tyrosine; unindexed drug; valine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Scaling of cardiac dimensions removes the impact of body size allowing meaningful inter/intra group comparisons. Developing appropriate scaling approaches, scaling variables and extending the application to major vessels is warranted so underlying pathology can be detected and managed appropriately. The study aims to define relationships between aortic root dimensions and body surface area/height. Two hundred and twenty elite Rugby Football League athletes were recruited. All participants completed anthropometric assessments, a 12-lead ECG and echocardiogram. Aortic root was measured at the aortic annulus, sinus of valsalva, sinotubular junction and the proximal ascending aorta. Linear and allometric scaling were performed on the relationship between aortic measurements and body surface area/height. Absolute aortic root measurements fell within normal population data (mean ± standard deviation (range): aortic annulus: 22 ± 2 (17–28) mm, sinus of valsalva: 28 ± 3 (20–38) mm, sinotubular junction: 22 ± 3 (14–33) mm, proximal ascending aorta: 22 ± 3 (15–31) mm). Linear scaling to height produced size-independent indices at all aortic measurement sites (P < 0.05). Conversely, linear scaling using body surface area did not produce size-independent indices at any site (P > 0.05). Allometric scaling, using both body surface area and height, produced size-independent indices at all sites (P < 0.05). We recommend linearly scaling aortic root dimensions to height in elite Rugby Football League athletes and discourage the use of body surface area as a linear scaling quantity. Allometric scaling is also effective when using both body surface area and height.","2019","2020-05-20 00:43:06","2020-05-20 00:43:06","","94-100","","2","27","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1742271X18818607; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L626130875","adult; human; human experiment; male; article; rugby; heart rate; priority journal; training; adolescent; body mass; questionnaire; normal human; anthropometry; transthoracic echocardiography; aortic root; aortic sinus; ascending aorta; echocardiography; body size; heart left ventricle hypertrophy; diastolic blood pressure; systolic blood pressure; body surface; QRS complex; electrocardiography; cardiovascular system; real time ultrasound scanner; allometry; aortic annulus; Cardiovit ms 2010; electrocardiograph; heart size; sino tubular junction; Vivid Q","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Purpose: To report on scapula fractures in contact and collision athletes and assess the injury patterns of different mechanisms of injury. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: A retrospective case series was performed of all sports-related scapula fractures treated at a single institution between 2007 and 2015. The mechanisms of injury were divided into direct lateral impact, fall onto an outstretched arm, or abduction/external rotation. Results: A total of 11 patients were identified: 9 professional rugby players, 1 professional soccer player, and 1 amateur soccer player. The mean age was 28 years (range, 18-35 years). The mean return to play was 127 days in those treated nonoperatively and 163 days in those treated operatively. A direct impact mechanism occurred in 7 patients, all of whom sustained glenoid neck and body fractures and were treated nonoperatively. Two rugby players had a concomitant suprascapular nerve injury. An outstretched arm mechanism occurred in 2 cases, leading to posterior and inferior glenoid fractures. Both patients were treated operatively. An abduction/external rotation mechanism occurred in 2 cases, resulting in an anteroinferior and an anterior glenoid rim fracture. One case was treated operatively and the other was treated nonoperatively. Of those with glenoid fractures, 75% were not visible on plain radiographs and required further imaging. Conclusion: Scapula fractures acquired in sports are a serious injury with a prolonged recovery period. The mechanism of injury can help predict the injury pattern and highlight the need for further imaging. There is a high association with suprascapular nerve injuries.","2019","2020-05-20 00:43:09","2020-05-20 00:43:09","","","","12","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2325967119887388; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2003804092","adult; football player; human; male; article; bone radiography; elite athlete; rugby; soccer player; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; clinical article; physical activity; priority journal; return to sport; training; young adult; retrospective study; abduction; range of motion; arthroscopy; Bankart lesion; glenoid cavity; muscle atrophy; fracture fixation; dislocation; muscle weakness; acromioclavicular joint; arthrography; nerve injury; nerve paralysis; scapula fracture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Beneficial Collaboration of Multidimensional Measurements and Coach Assessments for Efficient Talent Selection in Elite Youth Football","Journal of sports science & medicine","","1303-2968","","","Due to the tremendous popularity of youth football, practitioners in this domain face the ongoing question of the most effective solutions in early talent selection. Although the scientific community has suggested multidimensional models for some time, coach assessments and motor performance tests remain common. Earlier research has determined the strengths and weaknesses within these different approaches. The current investigation directly compared the effectiveness of each approach in talent selection (coach assessment vs. motor performance tests vs. multidimensional data). A sample of 117 youth football players, their parents, and coaches participated in multidimensional measurements in the U14 age category (coach assessments, motor performance tests, psychological characteristics, familial support, training history, and biological maturation). The area under the curve (AUC [95% CI]) from receiver operating characteristic indicated the prognostic validity of each approach in predicting U19 player status five years after the assessments (professional vs. non-professional). Motor performance tests (0.71 [0.58; 0.84]) showed a lower AUC than the multidimensional data (0.85 [0.76; 0.94], p = 0.02), whilst coach assessments did not differ from the two others (.82 [.74; .90]). Further, combined talent selection approaches, especially the use of coach assessments and multidimensional data together, were significantly better at predicting U19 player status (0.93 [0.87; 0.98], p = 0.02 vs. multidimensional data only). Although certain limitations may impede further insights (summation of data, skipped use of non-linear statistics), scientific claims for using multidimensionality within talent selection were confirmed to be fruitful. In particular, the combination of the subjective coaches' eye with scientific data may buffer the mutual weaknesses of these different approaches. Future research should focus on optimizing the output of promising multidimensional models. Knowledge of detailed values relating to specific dimensions within these models and the implementation of enhanced non-linear statistics may enable further improvements in the field of talent selection.","2019","2020-05-20 00:43:10","2020-05-20 00:43:10","","32-43","","1","18","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L626483957","human; football; adolescent; physiology; decision making; psychology; motor performance; exercise test; aptitude; sexual maturation; athletic performance; anthropometry; mentor; knowledge; social support; family","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Seasonal accumulated workloads in collegiate men's soccer: a comparison of starters and reserves. J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2019-The purpose of this investigation was to quantify and compare player's season total-, match-, and training-accumulated workload by player status characteristics (i.e., starter vs. reserve) in American collegiate men's soccer. Global positioning system (GPS) and heart rate (HR)-derived workloads were analyzed from 82 collegiate male soccer athletes from 5 separate teams over the 2016 and 2017 seasons. Differences in total physical and physiological workloads (i.e., total distance, accelerations, and weighted HR-zone training impulse [TRIMP] score) as well as workloads over a range of intensity zones were examined using multilevel mixed models, with mean difference (MD) and effect size (ES) reported. Starters accumulated substantially more total distance (MD = 82 km, ES = 1.23), TRIMP (MD = 2,210 au, ES = 0.63), and total accelerations (MD = 6,324 n, ES = 0.66) over the season. Total accumulated distance in all velocity zones (ES [range] = 0.87-1.08), all accelerations zones (ES [range] = 0.54-0.74), and time spent at 70-90% HRmax (ES [range] = 0.60-1.12) was also greater for starters. Reserves accumulated substantially more total distance (MD = 20 km, ES = 0.43) and TRIMP (MD = 1,683 au, ES = 0.79) during training. Although reserves show elevated physical and physiological loads during training compared with starters, there is an imbalance in overall workloads between player roles, with starters incurring substantially more match and total seasonal workloads. These results indicate managing player workloads in soccer requires attention to potential imbalances between players receiving variable match times. Coaches and practitioners in collegiate men's soccer may consider implementing strategies to reduce discrepancies in loading between starters and reserves. Individualized monitoring of training and match workloads may assist in the implementation of more balanced load management programs.","2019","2020-05-20 00:43:14","2020-05-20 00:43:14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1519/JSC.0000000000003257; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629174652","adult; human; male; article; soccer; acceleration; heart rate; controlled study; season; workload; athlete; attention; effect size; physician; global positioning system","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Global positioning systems (4 Hz; VX Sport, Lower Hutt, New Zealand) were used to monitor 5 elite Gaelic football teams over a period of 5 years (2012-2016). In total, 95 matches equated to 780 full player data sets. Running performance was characterized by total distance (m) and high-speed distance (≥17 km·h; m). High-speed distance was further categorized into 4 match quarters. Time of season was determined by month of the year. Time of season had a significant effect on total distance (p ≤ 0.001 partial η = 0.148) and high-speed distance (p ≤ 0.001 partial η = 0.105). August and September were significantly different from every other month for total distance (p ≤ 0.001) and high-speed distance (p ≤ 0.002). Month of season and match quarter had a significant interaction with high-speed distance (p ≤ 0.001 partial η = 0.106). High-speed distances run in the fourth quarter in August (478 ± 237 m) and in September (500 ± 219 m) were higher than any other quarter in any other month.

One hundred and eleven elite youth players who belonged to an elite soccer club from the Spanish “La Liga” participated in this study. Players were classified into three age-categories: under 14 years (U14), under 16 years (U16) and under 18 years (U18); and they were also classified in quartiles based on their date of birth (i.e., January-March, Q1; April-June, Q2; July-September, Q3; October-December, Q4). In addition, two further classification criteria were established based on the selection (i.e., selected and non-selected players) and promotion (i.e., promoted and non-promoted players) processes. The main results showed that in U14 and U16 age-categories, players born early in the year were over-represented compared to players born late in the year, although birth-distribution was not associated with the likelihood of a player to be selected or promoted. In addition, less fat in sum skinfolds, less percentage of fat, higher percentage of muscle and lower endomorphy and mesomorphy components were showed in U14 selected players, in comparison with non-selected players. Likewise, better sprint performance was found in U16 selected players versus non-selected ones. However, no significant differences on anthropometry, body composition, somatotype and physical performance were found between promoted and non-promoted players. Therefore, our results suggest there is need for coaches to reorient their talent identification programs in order to make sure that players selected to continue playing in the club have the potential to promote to the excellence in soccer.","2019","2020-05-20 00:43:19","2020-05-20 00:43:19","","","","7","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0219945; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002411754","human; article; soccer; controlled study; physical performance; juvenile; anthropometry; somatotype; body composition; skinfold; muscle","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: In 14 elite youth football players, morning assessments of subjective wellness (fatigue, sleep quality, muscle soreness, stress and mood), jump performance (countermovement jump height [CMJ], squat jump height [SJ] and drop jump contact time [DJ-CT], height [DJ-JH] and reactive strength index [DJ-RSI]) and triaxial accelerometer data (PlayerLoadTM (PL), the individual movement planes of PL (anterior–posterior [PLAP], mediolateral [PLML] and vertical [PLV]) and the percentage contribution of each component plane) were collected before (−24 h and immediately prior) and after (+24 h, +48 h) a standardised strenuous training session on two occasions in order to assess the reproducibility of a training-induced fatigue response. Sensitivity was assessed via the signal: noise (S:N) ratio of the changes in fatigue measures +24 h post training and the minimum detectable change for each measure. Results: DJ-RSI, PLML and %PLV were found to be sensitive measures of training-induced fatigue, which displayed a reproducible response (S:N > 1 on both occasions). CMJ, SJ and all subjective wellness measures were not able to detect a reproducible fatigue response.

Methods: Retrospective chart review of young athletes presenting to sports medicine clinic at a tertiary level medical center over 10 years. Electronic medical records were searched using the term sesamoid. Inclusion criteria included hallucal sesamoid injury as a result of sports/dance participation. Outcome measures were sport/dance, diagnosis, time from onset to first clinic visit, return to sport time. Results: Six hundred seventy-three hallucal sesamoid injuries were included in the final analyses; 82.0% (N = 552) female, 18.0% (N = 121) male, mean age 16.4 ± 4.1 years (95% CIs: 16.0-16.7), mean BMI 21.5 ± 3.8 mg/kg2 (95% CIs: 21.2-21.8). The leading 3 sports for females were dance 42.3% (N = 221), running 14.0% (N = 73) and soccer 10.0% (N = 52) and for males running 20.5% (N = 23), soccer 16.1% (N = 18) and basketball 9.8% (N = 11). The 3 most common diagnoses by sex were sesamoiditis 59.8% (N = 330), bipartite sesamoid 18.5% (N = 102) and sesamoid stress fracture 17.6% (N = 97) in females and sesamoiditis 65.3% (N = 79), sesamoid stress fractures 14.0% (N = 17) and bipartite sesamoid 13.2% (N = 16) in males. Diagnostic imaging modalities included radiographs 62.9% (N = 423), MRI 47.8% (N = 322) and CT 13.7% (N = 92). Mean time from pain onset/injury to first clinic visit was 123.8 ± 223.5 days (95% CIs: 100-147.5). Mean time from first clinic presentation to return to sport was 229.4 ± 277.1 days (95% CIs: 200.0-258.9). Conclusions: Sport and diagnosis profile differed between male and female athletes with sesamoid injuries, although runners were well represented in both groups. Onset of injury to first clinic evaluation was often delayed and prolonged time to return to sport participation was common. Significance: Improved knowledge surrounding sesamoid injury will support anticipatory guidance promoting timely evaluation and treatment to minimize time loss from sport.","2019","2020-05-20 00:43:31","2020-05-20 00:43:31","","145","","2","29","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/JSM.0000000000000724; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629860287","sports medicine; conference abstract; female; human; male; soccer; diagnostic imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; basketball; major clinical study; return to sport; adolescent; body mass; running; outcome assessment; retrospective study; runner; pain; dancing; X ray film; stress fracture; medical record review; electronic medical record; anticipatory guidance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, a binary approach to classifying prior injury (i.e., yes/no) is commonly implemented and may constrain scientific findings, as it is possible that variations in the amount of time lost due to an injury will impact subsequent injury risk to differing degrees. Accordingly, this study investigated whether session availability, a surrogate marker of prior injury, influenced the risk of subsequent non-contact lower limb injury in Australian footballers. Data were collected from 62 male elite Australian footballers throughout the 2015, 2016, and 2017 Australian Football League seasons. Each athletes participation status (i.e., full or missed/modified) and any injuries that occurred during training sessions/matches were recorded. As the focus of the current study was prior injury, any training sessions/matches that were missed due to reasons other than an injury (e.g., load management, illness and personal reasons) were removed from the data prior to all analyses. For every Monday during the in-season periods, session availability (%) in the prior 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, 77, and 84 days was determined as the number of training sessions/matches fully completed (injury free) relative to the number of training sessions/matches possible in each window. Each variable was modeled using logistic regression to determine its impact on subsequent injury risk. Throughout the study period, 173 non-contact lower limb injuries that resulted in at least one missed/modified training session or match during the in-season periods occurred. Greater availability in the prior 7 days increased injury probabilities by up to 4.4%. The impact of session availability on subsequent injury risk diminished with expanding windows (i.e., availability in the prior 14 days through to the prior 84 days). Lesser availability in the prior 84 days increased injury probabilities by up to 14.1%, only when coupled with greater availability in the prior 7 days. Session availability may provide an informative marker of the impact of prior injury on subsequent injury risk and can be used by coaches and clinicians to guide the progression of training, particularly for athletes that are returning from long periods of injury.","2019","2020-05-20 00:43:32","2020-05-20 00:43:32","","","","JUN","10","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2019.00737; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628533114","adult; football player; human; male; article; sport injury; training; cohort analysis; leg injury; Australia; disease marker","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The training programme covered 44 training units. The research was made on a sample of 120 soccer players. For the assessment of shooting ball accuracy the three tests were used: Straight foot accuracy in the vertical target, Elevation foot accuracy in the vertical target and Elevation head accuracy in the vertical target. In the area of comparative statistics, used t-test for big paired samples. Based on the numerical values of the t-test it can be concluded that there are statistically significant diff erences in all three variables to estimate the shooting ball accuracy. In this research the authors were guided by the fact that this kind of training program in preparation period, where dominates the situational model training is very eff ective in terms of raising the shooting ball accuracy with U16 soccer players, because the model that is used in this training period abounds in exercises in which dominates the shooting ball accuracy, in straight and elevation line. The obtained results can be directed towards innovation plans and programs in the preparation period, and the adaptation of the same needs of the respective population.

Men are affected more often but do less about it and few weight loss services attract men in particular. To evaluate the effectiveness of a men-only weight loss program, Football Fans in Training (FFIT), delivered by football clubs in the German Bundesliga, we did a non-randomized trial with a waiting list control group. Participants' data were collected between January 2017 and July 2018. FFIT is a 12-week, group-based, weight loss program and was delivered in stadia and facilities of 15 professional German Bundesliga clubs. Inclusion criteria were age 35-65 years, BMI ≥ 28 and waist circumference ≥100 cm. Clubs recruited participants through Social Media, E-Mail and match day advertisement. 477 German male football fans were allocated to the intervention group by order of registration date at their respective clubs. 84 participants on waiting list were allocated to the control group. Primary outcome was mean difference in weight loss with treatment condition over time as independent variable. We performed a multilevel mixed-effects linear regression analysis. Results were based on Intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis with Multiple Imputation. After 12 weeks, the mean weight loss of the intervention group adjusted for club, course and participants' age was 6.24 kg (95% CI 5.82 to 6.66) against 0.50 kg (-0.47 to 1.49) in the comparison group (p < 0.001). The results indicate that Football Fans in Training effectively helped German men to reduce their weight and waist circumference.","2019","2020-05-20 00:43:48","2020-05-20 00:43:48","","1-35","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17461391.2019.1660809; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629183167","adult; human; male; article; football; controlled study; major clinical study; body mass; e-mail; gender; outcome assessment; healthy lifestyle; advertising; obesity; hospital admission; controlled clinical trial; comparative effectiveness; German (citizen); linear regression analysis; independent variable; social media; waist circumference; weight loss program","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is well known that RST effects may depend on several variables such as the duration of the protocol and repeated-sprint methodology. Few studies have evaluated very short-term protocols and compared different RST modalities. The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of 2 week RST including straight sprints or changes of direction (CODs) on physical performance in a sample of soccer players. This study used a randomised pre-post parallel group trial design. The participants were assigned to either an RST group using straight sprints (RST-SS = 18 players) or an RST group using CODs (RST-COD = 18 players). The protocols were: 3 sets of 7 x 30 m sprints for the RST-SS and 7 x 20 + 20 m (one COD of 180°) for the RST-COD, with 20 s and 4 min recovery between sprints and sets, respectively. The following evaluations were performed: 10 and 20 m sprint, agility test, repeated sprint test (RSTbest and RSTmean), and Yo-Yo Recovery Level 1. After the training period, the RST-SS did not report any performance variation, while the RST-COD showed improvements in the 10 m sprint and RSTbest (effect size = 0.70 and 0.65, respectively). The between-group analysis did not report any statistical difference between the RST-SS and the RST-COD. In conclusion, this study did not support the utilisation of a very short-term RST protocol with soccer players, however, the RST-COD presented some additional benefits in sprint performance compared to the RST-SS.

Methods: Seventy-three female collegiate soccer athletes. Subjects were assigned to 4 groups: the control/simulated heading (G1), control/heading (G2),1to2 previous concussion/heading (G3) and 3 or more concussion/heading (G4). Symptom scores and BESS measures were taken before and after an acute bout of purposeful soccer heading (linear and rotational) consisting of 15 headers separated by one minute. Results: Concussion symptom scores in both the G3 and G4 groups were significantly higher post-linear (LIN) heading than with either control group. However, these same changes were not significant post-rotational (ROT) heading. The G3 group demonstrated worse BESS scores post-LIN heading than any of the other groups. G2 scored worse post-ROT with regard to BESS scores. Concussion-related symptoms are elevated in subjects with one or more concussions both at baseline and following an acute bout of purposeful heading in our cohort. It also appears that those with concussion histories exhibit deficits in balance measures immediately following the purposeful heading drill. Conclusions: Female soccer players with histories of concussions demonstrate more symptoms and have worse balance following episodes of purposeful heading than their counterparts without histories of concussion. This cohort may be those most vulnerable to long-term effects of repetitive head impacts that have been previously reported in sports such as American football and boxing. Studies examining this cohort of players over the long term are warranted. Significance: Coaches and clinicians should be aware of those individuals with concussion histories so that they initiate protective steps to limit their exposure to purposeful heading drills in practice and to minimize those same exposures during games.","2019","2020-05-20 00:43:56","2020-05-20 00:43:56","","147-148","","2","29","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/JSM.0000000000000724; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629860345","adult; conference abstract; female; human; football; soccer player; controlled study; cohort analysis; concussion; simulation; boxing; cell cycle G1 phase","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study examined whether SS could improve anaerobic power in a group of well-trained athletes. A secondary purpose was to examine the effect of SS on the severity of delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS). Methods: This was a double-blind, cross-over design with 10 male varsity football players (mean age = 22 years; height = 183.6cm; weight = 90.3kg). The athletes performed three Wingate cycle ergometer tests 5 minutes apart as a test of peak power, average power and fatigue index. DOMS were recorded on a 0-10 visual analogue scale (VAS) at 24, 28, and 72 hours post exercise. Prior to exercise and 5 minutes following the last Wingate test, blood was taken for analysis of selected cytokines. The athletes were randomly assigned to SS or placebo groups for three weeks and, following a three-week washout period, the experimental treatments were reversed. Results: Following SS supplementation, the peak power increased by 33.8 W (a 3% increase) and mean power by 6.7 W (a 1% increase). In the placebo group the peak power decreased by 11.2 W (-2.6%) and the mean power decreased by 17.2 W (-1%). DOMS values on the VAS were higher in the placebo group at 24, 48, and 72 hours post-exercise (P= 3.2, 2.2, 1.3 vs. SS= 2.5, 1.6, 0.6). There were no statistically significant changes in the performance measures between the two groups however (p>0.05). There were no significant changes in the cytokine measures following supplementation with either SS or placebo. Conclusion: All athletes completed the trial. SS was well tolerated and resulted in improvements in anaerobic power and in reducing the level of DOMS post-exercise. There were no adverse effects reported. Clinical implications: SierraSil is safe to use in highly trained athletes and resulted in improvements in anaerobic power and in reducing the level of DOMS post-exercise in a 'sport significant' way.

In football (soccer), there is little consensus, and a side-to-side difference of <10% is often suggested as a criterion. To date, no study has determined whether differences exist when comparing the strength of the injured limb at RTS with the preinjury level. PURPOSE: The aims of this study were to compare the isokinetic strength at RTS with preinjury strength in the injured limb and to investigate the side-to-side differences at RTS. METHODS: This study was based on a pooled group of patients participating in two single-site randomized controlled trials. All eligible professional male soccer players who suffered a hamstring injury confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging were included. The isokinetic strength of the injured limb at RTS was compared with preinjury screening tests, and the side-to-side difference was determined at both time points. RESULTS: In total, 41 hamstring injuries were included in the analyses. Side-to-side differences in isokinetic strength at RTS were similar to preinjury levels. At RTS, the average strength of the injured limb was >95% compared with preinjury strength. Overall, 63.4% of the players had a >10% negative strength difference (i.e., the injured limb being weaker), and 57.9% of the players had a >10% positive strength difference (i.e., the injured limb being stronger) in at least one of the five isokinetic variables. CONCLUSION: The distribution of isokinetic strength differences when comparing strength at RTS with preinjury measures was similar, urging clinical caution when interpreting these results. Small changes in the isokinetic strength of the injured limb at RTS compared with preinjury strength suggest that isokinetic cutoff values are not useful to guide the restoration of strength as a criterion for RTS after hamstring injury.","2019","2020-05-20 00:44:03","2020-05-20 00:44:03","","1091-1098","","6","51","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1249/MSS.0000000000001900; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L627865879","adult; human; male; article; soccer player; hamstring muscle; injury; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; controlled study; return to sport; randomized controlled trial; screening test","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Imaging measure includes plain radiography, ultrasonography, and MRI examination. Treatment strategies include controversial nonoperative treatment with a significant failure rate and several surgical procedures were reported. We reporting a chronic peroneal longus dislocation case in our hospital. Material and methods: Twenty-two years old male presented with a painful snapping lateral ankle suffered 3-month prior surgery. He played futsal and suddenly he felt popped on his ankle followed by pain and swelling. Dynamic ultrasound examination shows dislocation of peroneal longus tendon and convex shape of the retromalleolar groove. A five-centimeter long incision is made posterior to the lateral malleolus and during exploration we confirmed the ultrasound findings. We perform retromalleolar groove deepening by making bone flap medially, curette the cancellous bone and tamper back the bone flap, followed by superior peroneal retinaculum (SPR) reconstruction to the medial aspect of lateral cortex of the lateral malleolus to provide smooth gliding surface. We immobilize the ankle with a cast for six weeks for soft tissue healing. Result: After six weeks he can perform the almost full range of motion of the ankle without pain. Followed by further physiotherapy to regain full range of motion of the ankle. He returns to sport six months after surgery. Ultrasound examination shows the stability of the peroneal longus tendon. Conclusion: Dynamic ultrasound examination and retromalleolar groove deepening with SPR reconstruction are simple and inexpensive management for peroneal longus dislocation.","2019","2020-05-20 00:44:04","2020-05-20 00:44:04","","1-1","","","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","","","","https://gateway.library.qut.edu.au/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=c8h&AN=141090585&site=ehost-live&scope=site","Indonesia; Athletic Injuries -- Therapy; Ankle Dislocation -- Therapy; Congresses and Conferences -- Indonesia; Peroneus Longus Muscles -- Pathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The gene of this cytokine is highly polymorphic, one of which is located on 5´flanking region at position −511 (rs16944, A-511 G). This allele encodes IL-1β protein with less activity in comparison with wild type. In this research, 40 subjects of professional athletes in futsal and volleyball fields have been studied in their anthropometric and physiological indexes and also IL-1β genetic polymorphisms. Our results show that in subjects carrying IL-1β A (−) SNP or wild type allele, the weight, body fat and some other physiological indexes have been increased. This might have relation with elevated plasma level of leptin which is conducted by IL-1β A (−) allele. These findings suggest a remarkable relation between genetic polymorphisms of IL-1β gene and physical potential of athletes.","2019","2020-05-20 00:44:06","2020-05-20 00:44:06","","","","","22","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mgene.2019.100598; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002370192","human; article; clinical article; priority journal; athlete; body mass; interleukin 1beta; normal human; muscle mass; body fat; nutritional status; gene frequency; genotype; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; body composition; single nucleotide polymorphism; anthropometric parameters; genetic polymorphism; cell differentiation; radiation exposure; genetic analysis; energy cost; total body water; waist circumference; 5' flanking region; apoptosis; appendicular skeleton; Berg Balance Scale; cell proliferation; genomic DNA; restriction fragment length polymorphism; waist hip ratio","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A single session of straight line and change-of-direction sprinting per week does not lead to different fitness improvements in elite young soccer players. J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2019-Effective prescription is especially important in elite soccer players, who have a very limited time to dedicate to specific physical development as a consequence of factors such as congested match schedules and travel. The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of one repeated-sprint training (RST) session per week over an 8-week period on physical performance. A second aim was to compare the effect of RST involving straight sprints (RST-SS) or changes of direction (RST-COD). This study used a randomized pre-post parallel group trial design. The elite soccer players were randomly assigned to either an RST-SS (10 players) or RST-COD (10 players). RST-SS was 3 sets of 7 × 30-m sprints with 20-second and 4-minute recovery between sprints and sets, respectively. RST-COD was 3 sets of 7 × 20 + 20 m (one COD of 180°) shuttle sprints with 20-second and 4-minute recovery between sprints and sets, respectively. The physical tests selected were long jump, repeated-sprint ability (RSA) best, RSA mean, 505 agility test, Yo-Yo recovery level 1, 10, 30, and 40 m sprints. RST-SS reported unclear variations in long jump, sprint 30 m, sprint 40 m, RSA best, and RSA mean, whereas RST-COD showed unclear and trivial variations in sprint 10 m, sprint 30 m, sprint 40 m, RSA best, and RSA mean. The between-group analysis did not report any statistical difference. In conclusion, a single session of RST-SS and RST-COD do not improve soccer-specific fitness indicators in elite youth players during the season.","2019","2020-05-20 00:44:09","2020-05-20 00:44:09","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1519/JSC.0000000000003369; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629228818","human; article; soccer player; controlled study; season; physical performance; juvenile; randomized controlled trial; agility; chemical oxygen demand; comparative effectiveness; parallel design","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The standard deviation of the center of pressure displacements in anterior-posterior and medio-lateral directions were used as dependent variables. Irrespective of age groups and type of sport, the results failed to indicate significant leg differences in single-leg balance performance. The soccer players showed significant better single-leg balance performance in anterior-posterior direction in the dynamic balance test on the firm and foam surface compared to the swimmers.

Single-leg Roman chair hold is more effective than the Nordic hamstring curl in improving hamstring strength-endurance in Gaelic footballers with previous hamstring injury. J Strength Cond Res 33(12): 3302-3308, 2019-Poor hamstring strength-endurance is a risk factor for hamstring injuries. This study investigated the effectiveness of the single-leg Roman hold and Nordic hamstring curl in improving hamstring strength-endurance. Twelve Gaelic footballers (mean ± SD age, height, and mass were 25.17 ± 3.46 years, 179.25 ± 5.88 cm, 85.75 ± 4.75 kg, respectively) with a history of hamstring injury were randomized into 2 groups that performed 6 weeks of either Nordic hamstring curl or single-leg Roman chair hold training. The single-leg hamstring bridge (SLHB) was measured before and after intervention. The Roman chair group showed a very likely moderate magnitude improvement on SLHB performance for both legs (23.7% for the previously injured leg [90% confidence interval 9.6-39.6%] and 16.9% for the noninjured leg [6.2-28.8%]). The Nordic curl group showed a likely trivial change in SLHB performance for the noninjured leg (-2.1% [-6.7 to 2.6%]) and an unclear, but possibly trivial change for the previously injured leg (0.3% [-5.6 to 6.6%]). The Roman chair group improved very likely more with a moderate magnitude in both the noninjured (19.5% [8.0-32.2%]) and the previously injured leg (23.3% [8.5-40.0%]) compared with the Nordic curl group. This study demonstrated that 6-week single-leg Roman chair training substantially improved SLHB performance, suggesting that it may be an efficacious strategy to mitigate hamstring (re-) injury risk. Conversely, 6-week Nordic curl training did not substantially improve SLHB performance, suggesting this may not be the intervention of choice for modifying this risk factor.","2019","2020-05-20 00:44:15","2020-05-20 00:44:15","","3302-3308","","12","33","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1519/JSC.0000000000002526; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629956059","adult; human; male; soccer; sport injury; hamstring muscle; injury; pathophysiology; controlled study; young adult; physiology; randomized controlled trial; resistance training; muscle strength; procedures; endurance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: Data was collected from 20 professional rugby sevens players from one team across one competitive season. Activity profiles were measured using wearable microtechnology devices, and technical performance measures were collected using match video analysis. A principal components analysis was conducted to reduce the dimensionality of the physical and technical match performance variables into single index values incorporating each variable's distinct information. Linear mixed models were then constructed to examine the collective influence of external contextual factors on physical and technical index scores. Results: Increased points conceded, a winning match outcome, and more favourable weather all had positive impacts on the Physical Performance Factor, with all other situational factors examined not contributing to a significantly better model fit. Technical Performance Factor values were shown to increase with longer match involvement durations and decrease when playing against higher ranked opponents. Conclusions: These findings show that winning the match, conceding more points, and more favourable weather conditions are associated with increased physical performance; whilst technical performance improved with longer playing durations and playing lower ranked opponents.

Little information exists regarding the magnitude of traction forces at shoe-surface interface across a full season of elite football (soccer) using common football shoes. Objective To assess variation in shoe-surface traction of six different football shoe models throughout a full playing season in Qatar encompassing climatic and grass species variations. Methods Football shoes were loaded onto a portable shoe-surface traction testing machine at five individual testing time points to collect traction data (rotational and translational) on a soccer playing surface across one season. Surface mechanical properties (surface hardness, soil moisture) and climate data (temperature and humidity) were collected at each testing time point. Results Peak rotational traction was significantly different across shoe models (F = 218, df = 5, p <0.0001), shoe outsole groups (F = 316.2, df = 2, p < .0001), and grass species (F = 202.8, df = 4, p < 0.0001). No main effect for shoe model was found for translational traction (F = 2.392, p = 0.07). Conclusions The rotational (but not translational) traction varied substantially across different shoe types, outsole groups, and grass species. Highest rotational traction values were seen with soft ground outsole (screw-in metal studs) shoes tested on warm season grass. This objective data allows more informed footwear choices for football played in warm/hot climates on sand-based elite football playing surfaces. Further research is required to confirm if these findings extend across other football shoe brands.","2019","2020-05-20 00:44:22","2020-05-20 00:44:22","","","","4","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0216364; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2001937537","article; football; soccer; humidity; controlled study; rotation; weather; grass; shoe; hardness; surface property; Qatar; soil moisture; surface traction; temperature","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: The first season of AFLW technical data were analysed. All matches (n = 26) were separated into winning and losing subsets and score margins were recorded. To investigate the influence of technical involvements on overall performance, final ladder position was also recorded. Results: Uncontested possessions and the ratio between the number of times the ball was inside the attacking 50-m zone (inside 50s) and goals scored, were identified as the biggest predictors of match outcomes in the AFLW. Larger winning margins were associated with reduced marks ""inside 50"" and a lower inside 50: goals scored ratio. Kicks and contested marks demonstrated significant relationships with final ladder position, with these involvements decreasing as the ladder position moved closer to eight. Conclusions: Team game plans should promote the importance of finding space and completing a number of passes in the attacking 50-m zone to allow closer shots on goal.

We performed a prospective observational cohort study with 70 middle school and 64 high school American football players. Subjects completed preseason baseline assessments, including paper-pencil and computerized neuropsychological testing, a symptom scale, a neurological evaluation including self-reported sleep characteristics, and a Brain Network Activation (BNA) auditory oddball task assessing ERP activity. There was a correlation between shorter sleep duration and decreased capacity for memory and attention based on ERP amplitudes and latencies. Additionally, subjects with short sleep reported more “balance problems” and “sensitivity to noise,” and feeling less “nervous or anxious” compared to subjects reporting recommended sleep. High school subjects with short sleep were also more likely to have a diagnosis of headache or migraine. There were no differences between the short and recommended sleep groups on neuropsychological testing. BNA may be a more sensitive measure of cognition than neuropsychological testing or standard clinical evaluation, detecting pre-clinical markers of decreased memory and attention capacity in athletes with short sleep duration.","2019","2020-05-20 00:44:29","2020-05-20 00:44:29","","120-129","","3","2","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L626496050; http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/tsm2.69","football player; human; male; article; observational study; priority journal; controlled study; major clinical study; prospective study; adolescent; cohort analysis; concussion; sleep time; attention; child; memory; school child; depression; brain function; high school student; sleep latency; attention deficit disorder; sleep; event related potential; latent period; anxiety disorder; neuropsychological test; neuropsychology; brain network activation; middle school student; migraine; nerve cell network","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For comparison, we also collected 7-days of sleep data from 14 similar aged male, non-obese, physically active undergraduate University students, with no reported sleep problems. We sought to combine sleep duration and efficiency to rate sleep as either: 'good' 'average' or 'poor'. Individuals were classified as having good sleep quality based on an efficiency ≥85%, and duration of ≥420min. Poor sleep quality was based on an efficiency ≤ 75% or duration ≤ 360min. The remaining individuals were therefore classified as having average sleep quality. We also measured dietary intake levels via 7-day dietary inventory for both groups during the week of sleep analysis. The footballers and students returned 67 and 70 nights of sleep data respectively. The mean average sleep efficiency for the footballers was very similar to that of the students (79% v 79%; P = 0.67). In this group of academy level football players only 21% of the sample recorded sleep data would qualify as 'good' with 42% as 'average' and 37% as poor. This compares to the students' sleep which was 20%, 37% and 43%, for good, average and poor respectively. The data were assessed as not meeting parametric requirements and subsequently between-group comparisons were carried out using Mann-Whitney U tests for: total energy, carbohydrate, fat, protein, caffeine, tryptophan and alcohol intakes. These were all not significantly different, with the exception of protein which was higher in the football players (P = 0.009). In conclusion, the two groups appear similar in terms of sleep quality. Football players, who are required to recover efficiently from exercise and have high levels of concentration, have high levels of 'poor' and 'average' sleep quality. Interventions, such as sleep hygiene protocols, may improve sleep quality in football players (and students). Given that the shift needed for most of the cohort to move into the 'good' category is small in percentage terms, a relatively mild intervention may help football players make that shift.","2019","2020-05-20 00:44:32","2020-05-20 00:44:32","","14","","","29","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1123/ijsnem.2019-0057; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628160111","adult; conference abstract; football player; human; soccer player; exercise; controlled study; sleep time; carbohydrate; alcohol consumption; rank sum test; night; caffeine; student; sleep quality; diet; sleep hygiene; sleep disorder; tryptophan","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With the recent growth in female sport, practitioners need to be able to provide appropriate and specific support to our female athletes to ensure their sleep, and thus health and athletic performance are optimised. Therefore, the primary aim of the present study was to examine the duration, quality and patterns of sleep in elite female basketball and soccer athletes throughout their respective competitive seasons. The secondary aim of the study was to compare the sleep of elite female basketball, and soccer athletes with non-athletic age and gender-matched controls. Methods: Sleep was monitored in eleven elite female basketball athletes (mean ± SD; age 25 ± 5 years) and ten elite female soccer athletes (age 25 ± 6 years) across four separate seven-day periods (pre-, early-, mid- and late-season) throughout their respective competition seasons. Concurrently, sleep was monitored in eighteen non-athletic age and gender-matched controls (age 24 ± 3 years) over four separate seven-day periods. Bedtime, wake time, total sleep time, sleep onset latency, sleep efficiency, wake after sleep onset and fragmentation index were determined using wrist-watch actigraphy (GTX3 +, Actigraph, FL, USA) and sleep diaries. Results: Basketball athletes sleep-wake patterns (bedtime, 23:19 ± 1.3 h; wake time, 7:43 ± 1.4 h) were significantly different compared to soccer athletes (bedtime, 23:03 ± 2.2 h; wake time, 7:10 ± 1.5 h; p = 0.004) and non-athletic controls (bedtime, 22:58 ± 1.25 h; wake time, 7:10 ± 1.1 h; p = 0.0001). Total sleep time varied throughout the different stages of a competitive basketball season, for example, it was greatest during the pre-season (7.6 h ± 0.2 h) before decreasing by 0.6 h early in the season. There was also a difference in total sleep time between basketball and soccer athletes (7.7 h ± 1.5 h vs 7 h ± 1.4 h, p = 0.004), and soccer athletes and controls (7.0 h ± 1.4 h v 7.4 h ± 1.1 h, p = 0.01). Discussion: Our findings suggest sleep-wake patterns and total sleep time vary between female basketball and soccer athletes across a competition season. There are also marked differences in sleep-wake patterns and total sleep time between both athlete groups and non-athletic controls. The results highlight the importance of monitoring the sleep of female team sport athletes through the various stages of a competitive season.","2019","2020-05-20 00:44:34","2020-05-20 00:44:34","","S52","","","22","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsams.2019.08.240; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002914897","adult; conference abstract; female; human; male; soccer; basketball; controlled study; season; team sport; competition; athlete; young adult; gender; sleep time; wrist; sleep latency; sleep quality; actigraph","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of this study was to quantify sleep behaviours and alertness of professional rugby union players during training and a game. Thirty-six rugby union players from a Super Rugby team wore a wrist-activity device (Readiband™) to measure sleep for 3 days before, 3 days after and on the night of an evening game. Players were separated into those selected to play the game (n = 23) and those who were not (n = 13). Alertness was assessed for all training and game times using bio-mathematical modelling. Alertness measures ≤90% were considered to reflect impaired reaction time. Those selected to play in the game progressively increased sleep duration over the nights prior to the game (by 92 min p ≤ 0.05) by delaying wake time. Players went to bed later after the game (02:20 ± 114 min vs 22:57 ± 60 min; p ≤ 0.001) which resulted in decreased sleep duration on game night compared to pre-game nights (296 ± 179 min vs 459 ± 78 min; p ≤ 0.05). Four players did not achieve any sleep on game night. Sleep duration appeared to be truncated by early morning training sessions (before 08:00) on the second and third mornings after the game. Alertness was >90% for all training and game times for all players. In conclusion, in the days leading into a Super Rugby game, players delay morning time at wake and consequently increase sleep duration with post-game sleep reduced in some.

However, objective studies describing the sleep patterns in the lead up to and following competition are currently limited.Methods: Nine elite male Rugby League (RL) athletes performed 3 nights of sleep monitoring on six separate occasions during the RL season. The 3 nights included the following; 1) night before the game (G-1), 2) night of the game (G), and; 3) next night after the game (G+1). Sleep monitoring was performed using wrist-actigraphy.Results: There were significant differences (p < 0.05) between nights for total sleep time during the match periods (mean h:mm; 8:38, 4:53 and 6:42 for G-1, G and G+1, respectively). This was associated with a very large reduction of total sleep time on G in comparison to both G-1 (d = − 2.36) and G+1 (d = − 1.31). Sleep efficiency was also lower on the night of a game when compared to G-1 (d = − 1.58) and G+1 (d = − 1.20).Conclusion: Following RL matches, sleep onset is later, TST and SE are reduced, and sleep patterns the following night are also affected.

Nine international male rugby sevens players participated in this study. Actigraphic and subjective sleep assessment were performed on a daily basis to measure sleep parameters. Training load was measured during the entire pre-season period, and sleep data from the highest and lowest training load week were used in the analysis through magnitude-based inferences. During the highest training load, likely to possibly small, moderate decreases in time in bed (effect sizes; ±90% confidence limits: -0.42; ±0.44 for session rating of perceived exertion [sRPE], -0.69; ±0.71 for total distance covered [TDC]) and total sleep time (-0.20; ±0.37 for sRPE, -0.23; ±0.35 for TDC) were found. Possibly small (-0.21; ±0.35 for high-speed distance, -0.52; ±0.73 for acceleration/deceleration [A/D]) and likely moderate (-074; ±0.67 for TDC) decreases were observed in subjective sleep quality. Possibly small to very likely moderate changes in sleep schedule were observed. Sleep quantity and subjective quality seem to be deteriorated during higher loads of training. This study highlights the necessity to monitor and improve sleep among elite rugby sevens players, especially for the intense period of training.","2019","2020-05-20 00:44:39","2020-05-20 00:44:39","","1878-1886","","7","33","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1519/JSC.0000000000002839; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628516496","adult; human; male; football; pathophysiology; acceleration; season; physiology; fatigue; athletic performance; actimetry; sleep; time factor; sleep deprivation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study aims to find out how to improve the supervision over heading performance during learning process in youth footballers using an accelerometer. The research sample consisted of 63 footballers from age groups U11 - U17. Each person executed headings of a ball dropped from 0.5 m, 1 m, and 1.5 m. A triaxial accelerometer fixed to the back of the head was used in the measurements. For individual groups of participants, an approximate linear increase in peak head acceleration was observed for an increase in ball drop height (R2 = ± .99). Furthermore, strong correlations in the maximum head acceleration parameter amax were found between the attempts from all three heights. A linear decrease in peak head accelerations were observed with increasing age of the participants. The core importance lies in between relations of measured variables that show changes during acquisition of skills in heading in young footballers. Regular control accelerometer measurements can help determine the level of acquired skill and serve as an appropriate tool for preventing overloads or injuries of individuals.

We aimed to determine the incidence of injuries in French elite groups aged 13 and 14. Materiel and methods: We studied a cohort of 161 French elite soccer players aged 13 and 14 in a French Regional Academy. Injuries have been documented following the FIFA Medical Assessment and Research Centre guideline (F-MARC) during 5 seasons. Players were divided into 2 groups based on age: U14 (from 13 to < 14-year-old) and U15 (from 14 to < 15-year-old). The number, nature, location, and severity of all injuries were recorded during competition or training sessions. The incidence rate was reported per 1000 h of soccer exposure per player. Results: A total of 43 injuries have been recorded, which represents an incidence of 9.9 injuries per 1000 player-hours, with 31.4 and 7.3 injuries for competitions and training sessions, respectively. The average number of days that players were unavailable to train or play was 10.5 ± 4 days. More injuries were reported after school holiday breaks. Muscle strains were the most frequent injuries (3.4 per 1000 h per player). Osteochondroses were the most frequent injuries leading to non-availability for more than 28 days. Conclusion: School holiday breaks seem to have a great influence on the incidence of injuries. Osteochondroses were serious issues for the U14 and U15 soccer players and were responsible for long-term non-availabilities.","2019","2020-05-20 00:44:45","2020-05-20 00:44:45","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English French","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scispo.2019.10.005; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2004444889","human; article; soccer player; injury; clinical article; controlled study; incidence; season; competition; cohort analysis; practice guideline; medical assessment; muscle strain; osteochondrosis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The combination of these factors increases the risk of sports injuries. Aim of the study was to evaluate the effec-tivness of soccer match induced fatigue on landing biomechanical parameters and neuromuscular performance. Materials and methods: Eighteen young professional male soccer players were included the study. Fatigue level was assessed with the Borg Rate of Perceived Exertion and Pain Scale (BRPEPS). Neuromuscular function measured using a force platform during drop jump test. The Landing Error Scoring System (LESS) was used for infucient of landing biomechanics. The night before the offical match when players were not tired was selected for the pre-match test. The post-match test was conducted in two hours following the end of the match. Results: The difference of pre and post match the BRPEPS was statistically significant (p0.05). There were no statistically significant differences between pre-match and post-match neuromuscular performance values. However, pre-match and post-match LESS scores were statistically significant different(p0.05). Conclusion: It was concluded thatfatigue that occurs in a soccer match disrupts landing biomechanics. Impairment of landing biomechanics doesn’t releated with neuromuscular function, but reduction of postural control, proprioceptive acuity and neromuscular control may affect landing biomechanics.","2019","2020-05-20 00:45:00","2020-05-20 00:45:00","","391-397","","1","35","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.19193/0393-6384_2019_1_64; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L626114235","adult; human; male; article; soccer; soccer player; sport injury; hamstring muscle; biomechanics; clinical article; scoring system; young adult; cross-sectional study; neuromuscular function; ankle injury; ligament injury; muscle weakness; knee medial collateral ligament; pain assessment; shoulder dislocation; hip injury; muscle strain; low back pain; lateral malleolar fracture; Borg Rate of Perceived Exertion and Pain Scale; functional status assessment; landing biomechanics; Landing Error Scoring System; pubalgia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This case study attempted to bridge this gap by examining 4 referees' transition to the Israeli Premier League. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected as the referees advanced through their transitions. Data collection was done as part of a consultation process, designed to facilitate an effective transition adaptation. The analysis of data was guided by the framework of the scheme of change for sport psychology practice. The results indicated that the transition presented various on- (e.g., modifications of refereeing style) and off-field demands (e.g., social assimilation). The referees perceived the transition as a significant and positive career change event, yet 3 of them felt low to moderate perceived control over the new situation, as it was dependent on external factors. The referees coped with the transition through decision making, consulting with others, and applying problem-focused coping. They perceived the transition outcome as positive, maintaining balanced identities. The consultation process is discussed with several examples for the application of processes of change, with the objective of reaching a decision to change. The conclusions emphasize a balanced dual career, the rigor of the case study, and the role of the consultant.

Drawing on interview and questionnaire data with doctors and physiotherapists working in English professional football clubs, it explores the degree to which ethical compliance has improved since the publication of, and publicity surrounding, an earlier study of medical practice in professional football conducted by Waddington and Roderick. Thus, it provides an updated empirical examination of the management of medical ethics in sport. The data illustrate how the physical and social environmental constraints of sports medicine practice impinge upon the protection of athlete-patient confidentiality, how ethical codes and conflicting obligations converge to shape clinician behaviour in relation to lifestyle and injury issues, and the ethically problematic contractual constraints under which clinicians and athletes operate. It demonstrates that medical ethical practice continues to be very variable and draws on Freidson's work on medical 'work settings' to argue that there is a need to augment existing confidentiality policies with more structurally oriented approaches to ensure both professional autonomy and medical ethical compliance in sport.

A total of 19 soccer players from the university representative team participated in the study, developed during the competitive season. The players were classified in three categories based on their position on the field: defenses, midfielders, and forwards. Anthropometric somatotypes were determined using 10 variables according to the Heath & Carter method, and they were compared with those of athletes from the Pontifical University of Valparaíso (PUCV), who are champions in their country. The overall category of the players evaluated was mesomorphic endomorph with a 4.3-3.6-2.0 somatotype, with a difference bigger than 1 unit in the somatotype distance (SAD) with the PUCV reference team. The evaluated players have a similar somatotype according to their position, where SAD does not show bigger difference than 1. Defenses and midfielders presented mesomorphic-endomorph, whereas forwards mesomorph-endomorph somatotype. In the evaluated group, there were no significant differences by position on the field, which is unexpected considering the different requirements of the game per position. The relative adiposity component proved to be dominant in the players from our sample compared to the reference team, which could be a factor that influences sport performance. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR El objetivo del presente trabajo fue caracterizar el somatotipo en una muestra de futbolistas universitarias de una institución del norte de México, de acuerdo a su posición en el terreno de juego y compararlo contra el somatotipo de un equipo homólogo latinoamericano. Participaron 19 jugadoras de futbol soccer pertenecientes al equipo representativo de una Universidad del norte de México en la temporada competitiva. Las jugadoras fueron clasificadas por su posición en el campo, en tres categorías: defensas, medias y delanteras. Se determinó el somatotipo a partir de 10 variables antropométricas de acuerdo al método Heath & Carter y se comparó con un referente de jugadoras universitarias campeonas en su país pertenecientes a la Pontificia Universidad de Valparaíso (PUCV). La categoría general de las jugadoras universitarias fue endomorfo – mesomorfico con un somatotipo 4.3-3.6-2.0, y con una distancia somatotipica (SAD) entre grupos mayor a una unidad del referente homologo. Las jugadoras evaluadas presentaron un somatotipo similar por posición de juego con un SAD menor a 1, las defensas y medias fueron endomorfo-mesomorfico, mientras que las delanteras endomorfo-mesomorfo. En el grupo evaluado no existieron diferencias significativas por posición de juego, por lo que se hubiera esperado diferencias por las exigencias dentro del terreno de juego. El componente de adiposidad relativa resultó dominante en la muestra evaluada respecto al referente utilizado en el presente estudio, lo que podría ser un factor que influya en el rendimiento deportivo.

Like other gambling games, some psychological profiles either propel or sustain the behavior. We tested some neuropsychological profiles and personality traits that distinguish the regular online football gamblers from non-gamblers. Using a between group design, we tested 140 (60: online football gamblers; 80: non-gamblers) university undergraduate students between the ages of 18-26 years on specific neuropsychological domains (i.e., attention, inhibition and executive function) and personality traits. The neuropsychological tasks used were the Series Addition Task (a modified version of Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task), Stroop-Word Color Test and Trail Making Test (TMT), Parts A and B. The personality traits were assessed using the Big Five Personality Inventory. The findings showed significant differences between the online football gamblers and non-gamblers, reflecting greater agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism and openness to experience for the football gamblers. However, on the attention tasks, the non-gamblers made significantly fewer errors on forward addition and backward subtraction tasks, but did take more time to complete the backward counting task as compared to gamblers. On the other hand, online football gamblers took significantly less time to complete the Stroop congruence task and made significantly fewer errors on Stroop incongruence task. Similarly, the online football gamblers took less time to complete the TMT B and made fewer errors on TMT A. University undergraduate regular online football gamblers, as compared to non-gamblers, demonstrate stronger personality traits of ambition and gregariousness, and perform better on tasks of executive function, though they had more difficulty on tasks of divided and sustained attention.","2019","2020-05-20 00:45:39","2020-05-20 00:45:39","","171-180","","1","35","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L627490470; http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10899-018-9812-9","adult; female; human; male; football; adolescent; young adult; psychology; gambling; executive function; student; neuropsychological test; Nigeria; addiction; personality disorder; psychological rating scale","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Little is known about how player engagement with player welfare provision impact on mental health. Over two consecutive years, professional rugby football league (RFL) players were invited to complete an anonymous online survey assessing psychological stress, athletic identity, and attitudes to player welfare provision. Findings indicate that nearly half of respondents experienced symptoms of anxiety and depression. Multivariate analyses suggest that higher psychological stress and athletic identity and less knowledge and less positive attitudes to RFL mental health support is associated with worse mental health, whereas older age is associated with better mental health. The study has identified some key variables to focus on in developing player care and support management, and also suggest directions for future research guiding player welfare support, especially regarding increasing positive attitudes to mental health supports.

Meanwhile, soy milk (SM) was recommended as an alternative to CM for athletes who are vegetarian or lactose intolerant, since its carbohydrate (CHO) and protein (P) content are similar to those of CM. Thus, it might offer similar recovery benefits as CM. This study compared the effect of SM and CM consumption on blood lactate (BL) level, beep test score, and VO2max of football athletes. Methods: The research subjects comprised of twenty male football athletes who were provided with the beverages (SM or CM) daily over a period of four weeks. The beverages were consumed at isovolumic amount (600 mL) and matched color. The profile of SM sample was as follows: 450 kcal, 50.4 g CHO, 19.2 g P, while CM had 480 kcal, 66 g CHO, 15 g P. The experiment was conducted with single-blind randomized design, which was conducted after evening exercises. The beep test was conducted and evaluated before and after each treatment. As for BL level assessment, it was conducted before and after beep test. Data were analyzed using Independent T-test/Mann-Whitney and Paired T-test/Wilcoxon. Results: The level of BL was reduced after treatment eventhough no significantly decreased (pSM = 0.111 PCM = 0.061). Moreover, there was no significant differences between groups (ΔBLSM: -2.18 ± 3.90 ΔBLCM: -2.90 ± 4.29; p = 0.699).

The author explored spectators' emotional reactions manifested on social media. By using Twitter search application programming interface, 328,000 real-time tweets posted by fans of the Panthers and the Broncos during the Super Bowl 50 game were collected. The lexicon-based text mining approach (a big data analysis in social media analytics) was employed to classify tweets into five different emotions. The findings indicated that spectators expressed positive emotions when their team scored; conversely, they expressed negative emotions when the opposite team scored. Interestingly, spectators became habituated with each subsequent score from either of their preferred teams, which resulted in fewer expressions of emotions. However, when a team scored soon after the opposite team scored, fans expressed a surge of positive or negative emotions, accordingly. The results supported both the theories of affective disposition and opponent-process. Spectators' simultaneous experience of positive and negative emotions may contribute to fans' satisfaction, continued patronage, and mental health.

Little is known about participation patterns related to sport specialization. Purpose: To investigate soccer participation levels and sport specialization characteristics among youth soccer athletes. Study Design: Cross-sectional study. Methods: Adolescent athletes aged between 12 and 18 years completed an online survey addressing participant demographics, sports and soccer participation history, and level of specialization. Descriptive analyses characterized participation, while chi-square and Kruskal-Wallis tests assessed the influence of specialization, sex, and grade on survey variables. Results: Overall, 83.7% of 746 respondents participated in an organized soccer league outside of school, and 37% played in multiple leagues concurrently. Nearly three-quarters of respondents trained in soccer more than 8 months of the year, with those who participated in club soccer being more likely to trainmore than 8months of the year. More respondents were classified as high specialization (37.5%), followed by moderate (35.6%) and low (28.6%) specialization. No differences between sexes were noted for level of specialization or quitting other sports to specialize in soccer, but male athletes were more likely to train more than 8 months per year compared with female athletes. Respondents in older grades (9th-10th and 11th-12th grades) were more likely to be highly specialized and quit other sports to focus on soccer. No differences between grade levels were found among respondents training more than 8 months per year. Conclusion: The study findings suggest that many youth soccer athletes participated in multiple teams or leagues at the same time and trained more than 8 months of the year. Characteristics including participation on a club team, level of specialization, and male sex were associated with a greater likelihood of exceeding the 8-month training recommendation.","2019","2020-05-20 00:46:04","2020-05-20 00:46:04","","1-7","","3","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","","","","https://gateway.library.qut.edu.au/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=c8h&AN=135853429&site=ehost-live&scope=site","Soccer; Human; Descriptive Statistics; Questionnaires; Adolescence; Cross Sectional Studies; Athletes, Female; Athletes, Male; Chi Square Test; Sex Factors; Athletic Performance -- In Adolescence; Educational Status; Kruskal-Wallis Test","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The sample was composed of all shots on goal executed during twelve matches of different competition phases of the Fa7PC Paralympic Games in London 2012. The results show a high number of shots, especially in the last minutes of the match. Best-ranked teams are the most throwers and front players with more functional capacity (CP8) have the biggest offensive weight, despite not being more effective than other players. Right foot and instep are the most used areas to shot on goal, which more frequently have low trajectories, develop with the close opposition and from the field central areas. The launch with the highest probability of success is executed from Zone 2, 3 or 6, with the inside of the foot, a low height and without defensive opposition or only in front of the goalkeeper.

D.","Sport Specialization and Coordination Differences in Multisport Adolescent Female Basketball, Soccer, and Volleyball Athletes","Journal of athletic training","","1938-162X","10.4085/1062-6050-407-18","","CONTEXT: Early sport specialization, or the participation in 1 sport year-round to the exclusion of all others, is a growing concern in youth athletics because of its possible association with musculoskeletal injury. The underlying injury risk may be the result of coordination differences that sport-specialized athletes have been speculated to exhibit relative to multisport athletes; however, little evidence exists to support or refute this notion. OBJECTIVE: To examine relative hip- and knee-joint angular-motion variability among adolescent sport-specialized and multisport female adolescent athletes to determine how sport specialization may affect coordination. DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: Research laboratory. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: A total of 366 sport-specialized and 366 multisport adolescent female basketball, soccer, and volleyball players. INTERVENTION(S): Drop-vertical-jump (DVJ) assessment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Average coupling-angle variability (CAV) for hip flexion and knee flexion, knee flexion and ankle flexion, hip flexion and knee abduction, knee flexion and knee abduction, knee flexion and knee internal rotation, and knee abduction and knee internal rotation. RESULTS: The sport-specialized group exhibited increased coupling variability in dominant-limb hip flexion and knee flexion (P = .015), knee flexion and knee abduction (P = .014), and knee flexion and knee internal rotation (P = .048) while landing during the DVJ, although they had small effect sizes (η2 = 0.010, 0.010, and 0.007, respectively). No differences were present between groups for any of the other CAV measures of the dominant limb, and no differences were found for any CAV measures of the nondominant limb (all P values > .05). CONCLUSIONS: Sport specialization was associated with increased variability of critical hip- and knee-joint couplings responsible for effective landing during the DVJ. Altered coordination strategies that involve the hip and knee joints may underlie unstable landings, inefficient force-absorption strategies, or greater contact forces that can place the lower extremities at risk for injury (or a combination of these).","2019","2020-05-20 00:46:17","2020-05-20 00:46:17","","1105-1114","","10","54","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.4085/1062-6050-407-18; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629646363","female; human; article; soccer; hip; basketball; controlled study; major clinical study; adolescent; athlete; cohort analysis; outcome assessment; motor performance; athletics; volleyball; effect size; abduction; ankle; knee function; rotation; musculoskeletal injury; cumulative trauma disorder; youth sport; specialization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of this study was to examine training load and specialization as independent predictors of in-season injury in youth female soccer players. Methods: Seventy-two adolescent female soccer players had VO2max, sport participation and injury history measured prior to the season. Participants reported daily training load and any injury resulting in time loss. The proportion of injured players during the study period was compared between groups and Poisson mixed effects models were used to predict the number of individual injuries during the study. Results: A significant difference was identified between specialized (n = 42) and non-specialized (n = 30) athletes with respect to age (15.7 ± 1.3 vs 14.9 ± 1.6 years, respectively, P = 0.02), but not with respect to prior injury, VO2max or in-season training load (P . 0.05 for all). No difference was seen in the proportion of individuals from each group that experienced an injury during the study period (42% vs 38%, P = 0.96). After adjusting for age and training load, specialization group did not predict the number of individual injuries [OR = 1.07 (0.11-11.4), P = 0.96]. Conclusions: After adjusting for age and training load, sport specialization is not associated with an increased risk of in-season injury. Significance: This data differs from previous research that has included a broad range of athletic populations, suggesting that the relationship between sport specialization and injury may vary between sports, gender and/or competition level.","2019","2020-05-20 00:46:20","2020-05-20 00:46:20","","159-160","","2","29","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/JSM.0000000000000726; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629860155","conference abstract; female; human; male; soccer player; injury; aerobic capacity; controlled study; incidence; major clinical study; season; competition; adolescent; gender; juvenile; specialization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Limited data exist outlining its epidemiology, pathophysiology, and outcomes. We have presented a case of an epidural hematoma (EDH) that occurred during a high school soccer game. Case Description: A 16-year-old boy had experienced a head-to-ball collision and head-to-head collision with another player. He denied loss of consciousness, endorsed retrograde amnesia, and complained of a minor headache. On the sidelines, he subsequently passed brief orientation and physical exertion tests. However, on returning to play, he experienced blurry vision, along with headache and nausea/vomiting. At the local hospital, he was found to have a 2.6-cm right frontal EDH. After transfer to our institution, increasing somnolence was noted, prompting emergent evacuation of the EDH. His postoperative course was unremarkable, and he was discharged on postoperative day 2. At the 2-week and 3-month follow-up visits, he did not express any complaints or residual deficits and was cleared for full sporting activity. Conclusions: The present case highlights one of the few SRSBIs that have occurred in soccer. Because of their rarity and severity, a concerted effort should be made to report these cases of SRSBIs regarding the mechanism, postcollision symptoms, and long-term outcomes.","2019","2020-05-20 00:46:23","2020-05-20 00:46:23","","20-23","","","127","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wneu.2019.03.198; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2001844482","human; male; article; soccer; sport injury; case report; clinical article; adolescent; follow up; high school; Glasgow coma scale; headache; emergency surgery; brain injury; x-ray computed tomography; nausea and vomiting; somnolence; blurred vision; epidural hematoma; retrograde amnesia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: Data from the 2009/10 to 2013/14 academic years were obtained from the NCAA Injury Surveillance Program (ISP). Rates of hip/groin injuries, mechanism of injury, time lost from competition, and surgical treatment were calculated. Differences between sex-comparable sports were quantified using rate ratios and injury proportion ratios. A sport-specific biomechanical classification system, which included cutting, impingement, overhead/asymmetric, endurance, and flexibility sports, was applied for subgroup analysis. Results: In total, 1,984 hip injuries were reported in 25 NCAA sports, including 9 male and female sports, 3 male-only sports, and 4 female-only sports between the years 2009/10 and 2013/14, resulting in an overall hip injury rate of 53.1/100,000 athletic exposures (AEs). In sex-comparable sports, (basketball, cross-country, lacrosse, ice hockey, indoor track, outdoor track, soccer, swimming, and tennis), men were more commonly affected than women (59.53 vs 42.27 per 100,000 AEs respectively; rate ratio, 1.41; 95% confidence interval, 1.28-1.55). Subgroup analysis demonstrated that the highest rate of hip injuries per 100,000 AEs occurred in impingement sports (96.9). Endurance sports had the highest proportion of injured athletes with time lost >14 days (9.5%). For impingement-type sports, the most common mechanism of injury was no apparent contact (48.2%). The rate of athletes undergoing surgery per 100,000 AEs was highest in impingement-type sports (2.0). Conclusions: We have identified that impingement-type sports are most frequently associated with hip injuries. Additionally, this study demonstrates that hip injuries sustained in athletes who played impingement-type sports had a significantly higher rate of surgical intervention than other sport classifications.

A review of 11 countries' training programs was conducted, in which specific instances of training recommendations were examined to identify similarities and differences among nations. Results of our review suggest that not all of the programs emphasized children having fun, enjoying the game of football, or engaging in free play. For example, the program from England strongly emphasized outcome related abilities more than enjoyment or play related features of training. In contrast, the Italian, Canadian, and Australian documents discussed that allowing youth to play freely engaged children, ensured they were having fun, and encouraged a fascination with football. Programs recommending developmental games or free play often suggested the use of purposeful gameplay that resembled traditional competition or match-specific situations. Examining development recommendations across nations provides important insight into how youth sport development efforts are shaped around the world, especially as youth sport coaches seek to enhance youth engagement, while simultaneously helping youth improve their skills.

"A6RRP6IK","journalArticle","2019","Zakhem, Abe; Mascio, Michael","Sporting Integrity, Coherence, and Being True to the Spirit of a Game","Sport, Ethics & Philosophy","","17511321","","","The term 'sporting integrity' is widely used in the normative assessment of sports. The term, however, suffers from a lack of conceptual precision. Alfred Archer's 'coherence-view' of sporting integrity goes a long way to help clarify what 'sporting integrity' actually means and the specific institutional and individual obligations that it generates. Archer argues that 'sporting integrity' essentially means that the constraints athletes face 'cohere', in the sense of applying consistent inefficiencies between athletic competitors. For example, those who use performance enhancing drugs (PEDs) are less constrained than those who do not use PEDs, and thus PED use undermines sporting integrity. This paper presents the argument that over and above competitive coherence, sporting integrity means living up to the 'spirit' or 'ethos' of a game. The implications of this view are that a sport could have 'coherent' competitive constraints and still lack sporting integrity; additionally, a sport could have 'incoherent' competitive constraints and still demonstrate sporting integrity. These implications are drawn out relative to the three specific cases that Archer uses to illustrate his coherence view; namely, PED use in professional cycling, 'tanking' in Olympic badminton, and the prospect of allowing the Rangers Football Club entrance into the Scottish Premier League without playing through and first winning/qualifying in the lesser leagues.

Setting: U.S. Soccer Development Academy. Participants: Male youth soccer players (N = 2123).Assessment of Risk Factors:Sport specialization, weekly training volume, training ratio, and age.Main Outcome Measures:Previous sports-related injury, injury type (traumatic vs overuse), injury severity, and injury location. Results: Of 2099 participants (average age 13.2 ± 1.8 years), 61.7% were specialized in soccer (played soccer >8 mo/yr and no other sports) and 38.3% were nonspecialized (played soccer >8 mo/yr and also played other organized sports). Specialized athletes were older than nonspecialized athletes (13.7 ± 1.9 vs 12.5 ± 1.4, P < 0.0001). Thirty-three percent (690/2099) of athletes reported at least one previous sports-related injury for a total of 765 traumatic injuries and 25 overuse injuries. Distribution of injury type was similar for specialized and nonspecialized athletes. Among athletes with overuse injuries, nonspecialized athletes were more likely to report upper-extremity and trunk overuse injuries than specialized athletes. After accounting for age and weekly training volume, specialized athletes had decreased odds of reporting any previous injury compared with nonspecialized athletes [odds ratio (OR), 0.78; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.64-0.95], and similar odds of reporting a previous lower-extremity (LE) overuse injury as nonspecialized athletes (OR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.56-1.1). However, specialized athletes missed more practices due to injury than nonspecialized players [median = 3, interquartile range (IQR) 2-4 vs median = 2, IQR 2-4, P = 0.0003]. Conclusions: In this national sample of elite, male youth soccer players, after accounting for age and weekly training volume, specialized athletes had decreased odds of reporting any previous injury and similar odds of reporting a previous LE overuse injury as nonspecialized athletes. These data suggest the need for further research to determine whether injury risk related to sports specialization depends on sex, chosen sport, and skill/competitive level.","2019","2020-05-20 00:46:55","2020-05-20 00:46:55","","368-373","","5","29","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/JSM.0000000000000643; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L631051485","human; male; article; elite athlete; football; soccer; soccer player; sport injury; basketball; priority journal; tennis; controlled study; major clinical study; training; adolescent; cohort analysis; outcome assessment; retrospective study; age; swimming; trunk; United States; leg injury; track and field; baseball; lacrosse (sport); sports and sport related phenomena; injury severity; arm injury; sports specialization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study proposes to discuss the hypothesis that these reflex responses can be used to estimate motor neuron excitability and spinal synaptic transmission. Methods: Four groups of 14 athletes each (sprinters, middle-distance athletes, footballers and swimmers) have accepted at the beginning of the sporting season to measure the power and explosiveness of Bosco's carpet jump at the level of the soleus. by dumbbells and H and M reflexes by electromyography. After 10 months of training, the same variables were measured in both groups of athletes. Results: The comparison of Anova averages showed that the intergroup differences were all statistically significant (P < 0.05) for the maximum amplitude of the H reflex and that the means of this variable decreased significantly (P < 0.05) in the sprinters and increased significantly (P < 0.05) in middle-distance athletes. In addition, the bilateral correlations between physical and electromyographic parameters were all significant (P < 0.01) except for Mmax. However, comparisons between girls and boys did not reveal any significant results. Conclusion: These results suggest the existence of synaptic adaptation at the spinal level to explain the direction of the H-reflex evolution induced by the type of physical activity practiced (aerobic or anaerobic).","2019","2020-05-20 00:46:58","2020-05-20 00:46:58","","16-23","","1","34","","","","","","","","","","English French","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scispo.2018.06.005; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2001112224","female; football player; human; male; article; controlled study; season; analysis of variance; child; swimming; electromyography; girl; Hoffmann reflex; motoneuron; nerve cell excitability; soleus muscle; synaptic transmission","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These factors have often been studied in isolation with minimal consideration for the interactions between them, or the overall system in which they occur. The aim of this research was to model the actors, controls, and feedback mechanisms influencing the management of concussion in community rugby union using the Systems-Theoretic Accident Model and Processes (STAMP) method. Findings show that there are currently many inadequate controls, that are directly and indirectly impacting effective concussion management. The practical implications of these findings are discussed (e.g. improved guideline education, mandatory medical presence, rule amendments). Additionally, the model provides a sound framework similar team sports can use to inform research into injury management and prevention (e.g. rugby league, hockey, AFL). Practitioner Summary: Research shows that concussion management in regional sport is inconsistent due to contextual limitations. Systems-Theoretic Accident Model and Processes was applied to identify the systemic factors currently influencing concussion management practices in community sport. Findings show inadequate controls precipitate concussion management gaps. Practical implications of the findings are discussed.","2019","2020-05-20 00:47:01","2020-05-20 00:47:01","","1485-1494","","11","62","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00140139.2019.1654134; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629049896","human; theoretical study; article; rugby; controlled study; team sport; concussion; hockey; physician; practice guideline; endogenous compound; education; accident; sound; protein kinase p60; feedback system; precipitation; systems theory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2019-Power development is critical for enhancing rugby performance because there is a close relationship between power and sport-specific skills. The aim of this study was to examine the force-velocity profiling generated by adolescent rugby players in the squat and bench press exercises and to compare sex-related differences. Subjects were 46 men (age: 14.48 ± 1.31 years; body height: 1.65 ± 0.09 m; and body mass: 58.07 ± 13.01 kg) and 41 women (age: 14.93 ± 2.76 years; body height: 1.63 ± 0.12 m; and body mass: 59.23 ± 12.66 kg) who were recruited from a national amateur rugby league team. Maximal strength, power, and velocity were assessed on the squat and bench press exercises using a Smith Machine and a linear power transducer with intensities ranging from 40 to 80% 1 repetition maximum (1RM) on the squat and 50-80% 1RM on the bench press. 1 repetition maximum squat and bench press performance were 104.26 ± 30.83 and 46.97 ± 13.59 kg, respectively, for men and 115.17 ± 41.42 and 45.85 ± 16.71 kg, respectively, for women. The maximum squat power results for men and women were 521.91 ± 298.75 and 591.26 ± 352.69 N, respectively, and the maximum bench press power results for men and women were 190.26 ± 150.54 and 326.16 ± 195.57 N, respectively. Significant sex-related differences (p < 0.001) were found on the squat exercise for maximum (40%), mean (40-50%), and time to maximum velocities (40-80%) as well as time to maximum power (80%). On the bench press exercise, significant sex-related differences (p < 0.001) were found for power and time to maximum velocity (40%-60%-70%-80%). These results may aid in the design of strength and conditioning programs for adolescent rugby players by targeting training prescriptions toward enhancing strength or velocity.","2019","2020-05-20 00:47:04","2020-05-20 00:47:04","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1519/JSC.0000000000003336; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629228715","female; human; human experiment; male; article; rugby; clinical article; exercise; controlled study; adolescent; velocity; body height; prescription; protein fingerprinting; transducer","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, although they are routinely invited to take part in matches at national level, it is not yet clearly established whether referees who work in less prominent regions and soccer championships present the same levels of physical, technical and psychological preparation as referees from more important areas, such as the soccer teams of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Within this context, no studies have evaluated the physical conditioning and health parameters of Brazilian Soccer Confederation (CBF) referees who work in Espírito Santo. Objective: To assess the health and physical fitness levels of CBF soccer referees from Espírito Santo. Methods: A cross-sectional study with 16 participants, 6 referees, and 10 assistant referees. The protocol lasted 12 weeks and consisted of the following analyses: general characteristics, body composition, flexibility, and biochemical and cardiorespiratory profiles. Results: The referees all fell under the age range (26 to 41 years) required by CBF and had good body composition and flexibility results. The cardiorespiratory assessment (rest and effort) of the referees indicated satisfactory physical fitness and consequently, low risk for cardiovascular diseases based on resting heart rate (HR) (64 ± 13 bpm), HR reserve (126 ± 18 bpm) and VO2max (45.3 ± 5.7 ml·kg-1·min-1), results similar to those seen in elite international referees. Regarding the biochemical assessment, the parameters analyzed were within the normal range. Conclusion: Despite the fact that referees from the state of Espírito Santo work in a region of lesser national significance and relevance in the soccer domain, they present satisfactory levels of physical fitness and health parameters to act with safety and precision in national competitions. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR Introducción: Estudios apuntan que el desempeño técnico/táctico de árbitros de fútbol de campo puede ser impactado por aptitud física y estado de salud. Sin embargo, aunque sean rutinariamente convocados para partidos en el ámbito nacional, aún no está bien establecido si los árbitros que actúan en regiones y campeonatos de fútbol menos expresivos presentan los mismos niveles de preparación física, técnica y psicológica que los árbitros de centros de mayor relevancia, como el fútbol de São Paulo y del Rio de Janeiro. En este contexto, no hay estudios que evaluaron el condicionamiento físico y los parámetros de salud de árbitros de La Confederación Brasileña de Fútbol (CBF) que actúan en el Estado del Espírito Santo. Objetivo: Analizar la salud y los niveles de aptitud física de árbitros de fútbol del Espírito Santo que forman parte del cuadro de la CBF. Métodos: Estudio transversal con 16 participantes, siendo 6 árbitros principales y 10 asistentes. El protocolo perduró por 12 semanas y se compuso de los siguientes análisis: características generales, composición corporal, flexibilidad y perfiles bioquímico y cardiorrespiratorio. Resultados: El grupo de árbitros tenía edad dentro del límite máximo (26 a 41 años) exigido por el cuadro de la CBF y buenos resultados de composición corporal y flexibilidad. La evaluación cardiorrespiratoria (reposo y esfuerzo) de los árbitros denotó aptitud física satisfactoria y, consecuentemente, bajo riesgo de enfermedades cardiovasculares a partir de la frecuencia cardíaca (FC) de reposo (64 ± 13 bpm), FC de reserva (126 ± 18 bpm) VO2máx (45,3 ± 5,7 ml·kg-1·min-1), resultados similares a los observados en árbitros de elite mundial.

High school-aged American football players (n=7,214) who had participated in athletic performance combines between March 2015 and January 2016 were included in this analysis. Data included combine date and location, school state of origin, football position, class, height, weight, 10-, 20-, and 40-yd dash times, pro-agility, L-cone drill, vertical jump, broad jump, and power push-up. Participants were separated into high- (state population>10,000,000; HIGH; n=2,804), mid- (state population=5,000,000-9,999,999; MID; n=2,911), or low-population (state population<5,000,000; LOW; n=1,499) state of origin. Data were allometrically scaled to account for differences in body mass across high school grade levels and American football positions. All statistical analyses were performed on the allometrically scaled data. LOW athletes performed better than HIGH athletes in the 20-yd dash (p≤0.01). LOW athletes performed better than HIGH and MID in the 40-yd dash, proagility, broad jump, and power push-up (p<0.01). LOW and HIGH athletes performed better than MID in the Lcone and vertical jump (p<0.01). When considering population size, athletes originating from LOW states may demonstrate higher levels of athletic performance in football combine events hypothetically due to more opportunities for sports participation and playing time, leading to greater athletic development. Youth and high school coaches in MID and HIGH states might consider providing more opportunities for playing and individualized coaching to encourage long-term athletic development.

Video recordings of all (n = 8 matches) rugby world cup finals were used for the purpose of this study. Games were analysed using the video analysis software (Sports code V8.9, Sportstec, Australia) and supplementary data were collected from the official reports published by the International Rugby Board and from webpages of Rugby World Cups. Magnitude of differences between the winners and losers was assessed mechanistically. Only 5 tries in total were scored in the last 8 rugby world cup finals. The main two modes of scoring points were penalty kicks and drop goals. Winning teams attempted more penalty kicks, yet seemed to miss more. The number of drop goals was similar between winning and losing teams. These findings highlight the significance of having an on form place-kicker and from a defensive perspective, conceding fewer penalties in kickable positions. Winners of the Rugby World Cup final won more scrums and lost few line-outs, emphasising the importance of winning the set-pieces. Further establishment of these variables and their influence on performance may be used to evaluate team performances and plan more effective tactical approaches to competition ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR","2019","2020-05-20 00:47:16","2020-05-20 00:47:16","","247-256","","1","66","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","sph","","","","","https://gateway.library.qut.edu.au/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=135775901&site=ehost-live&scope=site","INTERNATIONAL Rugby Board; rugby union; *COACHES (Athletics); *RUGBY Union football; *SPORTS events; *RUGBY football teams; *WORLD Cup (Rugby football); game related statistics; performance team profiles","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, most previous research has focused on local sport fans and have neglected to examine these important out-of-market fans. To address this gap, the authors utilized qualitative methods, including interviews and general observations to explore the benefits out-of-market Pittsburgh Steelers fans received from participating in a fan club. It was found that participation in this group improved fans' overall well-being, enhanced their fandom, and allowed them to promote and discuss the club with other Steelers fans. These findings are among the first to indicate out-of-market fans may receive benefits similar to those of local fans. The results have theoretical implications as they extend this emerging line of research and practical implication as sport teams should cater to their out-of-market fans.

Twenty male rugby players (21.4 ± 2.1 y) completed two trials of a 2 × 23 min rugby movement simulation protocol during which the order of events was performed in a stochastic order, with 7–10 days between trials. Movement characteristics, heart rate (HR), RPE, maximum voluntary contraction (MVC), voluntary activation (VA%) of the quadriceps, Stroop test and subjective task load rating (NASA-TLX) were measured. The most reliable measures of external load was relative distance (typical error [TE] and CV% = 1.5–1.6 m min−1 and 1.4–1.5%, respectively), with all other movement characteristics possessing a CV% <5%. The most reliable measure of internal load, neuromuscular function and perceptual measures were for %HRmax (TE and CV% = 1.4–1.7% and 1.4–2.1%, respectively), MVC before (TE and CV% = 10.8–14.8 N·m and 3.8–4.6%, respectively), and average RPE (TE and CV% = 0.5–0.8 AU and 3.6–5.5%, respectively). The Stroop test, NASA-TLX and blood lactate produced the least reliable measures (CV% >5%). Future studies can confidently examine changes in several perceptual, neuromuscular, physiological and movement measures related to rugby activity using stochastic movements.

Sports is a prime example of this, and one that lends itself well to investigation because strategic rule-breaking is often measurable. Professional soccer is a highly competitive team sport with economic rewards for winning given to teams and players. It has a set of rules to ensure fair play, but the enforcement is incomplete, and hence can lead to strategic behavior. Using newly available data, we examine strategic time-wasting, a behavior that help teams win games, or tie games against superior opponents, but is contrary to the objective of game play as entertainment for the spectators. We demonstrate that strategic time-wasting is widespread and is done through delayed restart of the game after goalie capture of the ball, goal kick, throw-in, free kick, corner kick, and substitution. The strategic time-wasting has substantial magnitude, and models of the value per minute predict time-wasting well. Because this time-wasting is a result of incentives created by not stopping the game clock, we predict that a change to rules with stopped game clock when the play is stopped would make game play more time efficient.","2019","2020-05-20 00:47:29","2020-05-20 00:47:29","","","","12","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0224150; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2004319452","human; article; soccer","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Guided by phenomenological research orientation, this study aimed to identify sources of stress and coping strategies using semi-structured interviews with a sample of 12 male Fijian professional rugby players. Findings of the template analysis indicate that organizational stressors and environmental issues were dominant but differed in nature between the training camp and competition settings. Players experienced more uncontrollable situations than controllable ones in both settings and thus made greater use of emotion-focused coping strategies as a means to reduce stress. Disengagement and 'working off the energy' were the most frequently cited coping strategies. 'Silently the Fijian way' was identified by the players as a culturally specific form of coping. The findings of this study provide a foundation for future research into stress and coping in the context of professional rugby in Fiji and other Pacific Islands.

Knowing the formation and location of MTrPs is a great help to prevent their development and inactivate existing MTrPs. This study aimed to obtain new evidence that myofascial trigger spots (MTrSs), which are similar to human MTrPs, are found in dysfunctional motor endplates by observing the morphological characteristics of muscles and changes in biochemical substances. A total of 32 male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups: two control groups (i.e., C1 and C2) and two model groups (i.e., M1 and M2). C1 and M1 were used for acetylcholine (ACh) content measurement, while C2 and M2 were utilized for acetylcholinesterase (AChE) staining. In the model groups, blunt striking injury was induced and eccentric exercise was applied to the left gastrocnemius for 8 weeks. After 1 month, spontaneous electrical activity(SEA), AChE optical density (OD), muscle fiber diameter, and ACh content were measured. The results showed that extensive abnormal endplate noise (aEPN), including positive neurons, fibrillation potentials, fasciculation potential, and high amplitude (endplate spikes [EPS]), is present at MTrSs in M1. Quantitative electromyography results showed that the amplitudes of aEPN and frequency of EPS in M1 were significantly higher than those of C1. The ACh content of MTrSs in M1 was significantly higher than that in C1. The AChE OD value of M2 was significantly lower than that of C2. In addition, the diameter of the muscle fibers in the AChE-stained area was longer in M2 than in C2. In conclusion, MTrSs formed at the motor endplate with a larger diameter of muscle fibers. Excessive ACh release and decreased AChE activity at MTrSs stimulated muscle action potential and muscle contraction.","2019","2020-05-20 00:47:38","2020-05-20 00:47:38","","","","","711","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neulet.2019.134417; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002711406","article; priority journal; muscle contraction; statistics; nonhuman; gastrocnemius muscle; electromyography; nerve cell; animal experiment; animal model; skeletal muscle; muscle cell; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; electromyogram; enzyme activity; protein content; trigger point; acetylcholinesterase; action potential; animal behavior; animal cell; decapitation; fasciculation; histology; morphological trait; motor end plate; muscle action potential; muscle twitch; myofascial pain; myofascial trigger point; neuromuscular junction disorder; pentobarbital; rat; skeletal muscle cell; Sprague Dawley rat; staining","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, a pedagogical experiment was conducted, in which the independent variable was represented by a sport climbing program, introduced in the weekly training cycle for the experimental group, over the course of 14 weeks.

Methods: Yo-Yo IR1 performances of 32 players were assessed before and after 28.5 ± 6.8 days of pre-season training. Relationships between sub-maxHR and maximal-effort Yo-Yo performance, and changes in maximal-effort performance and sub-maxHR were compared. Results: Maximal-effort Yo-Yo IR1 performance and sub-maxHR correlated negatively (r = −0.73, CI −0.85 to −0.55, very large). Coefficient of variation (CV) of sub-maxHR was 2.4% (CI 2.0−3.3%), worthwhile changes of small (0.7 [CI 0.5−1.0%]), moderate (2.1 [CI 1.6−3.0%]) and large (4.3 [CI 3.3−6.1%]) were identified. Training-induced changes in sub-maxHR and Yo-Yo IR1 performance displayed a negative correlation (r = −0.57, CI −0.74 to −0.33, large). Conclusions: sub-maxHR has a very large negative relationship with maximal-effort Yo-Yo IR1 performance. Training-induced changes in sub-maxHR demonstrated a large negative relationship with changes in Yo-Yo IR1 performance. The CV and worthwhile changes can determine meaningful variations in sub-maxHR in professional rugby league players.

Subjective and objective responses to two rugby sevens world series competitions. J Strength Cond Res 33(4): 1043-1055, 2019-The purpose was to examine the utility of subjective and objective measures of player preparedness, interpreted at both group level and individual level, during 2 consecutive competitions of the World Rugby Sevens Series (WRSS). Subjective (sleep, energy, and muscle soreness ratings) and objective (heart rate [HR] at rest [HRREST] and in response to submaximal exercise [HREX]) measures were obtained from 16 male rugby 7s players from 1 team for 3 consecutive days (D1-3) at home (HOME) and on arrival at 4 tournament (T1-4) locations (T1-New Zealand; T2-USA; T3-Hong Kong; and T4-Tokyo) across 2 WRSS competitions (2 tournaments per competition) separated by 1 month. At a group level, energy ratings were significantly lower in T2 and T4 compared with HOME, and on D1 T2 compared with D1 T1 (p ≤ 0.05). Greatest variability in subjective ratings was observed during T1 and T3 at an individual level, particularly for sleep quality. Although at a group level HRREST and HREX significantly decreased in T1-4 compared with HOME (p ≤ 0.05), there was only a ∼50% agreement between the direction of change in HR indices at an individual level. Results from this study suggest that relocation between tournaments within WRSS competitions disrupts player preparedness measures to the largest degree. Hence, this period could be targeted by practitioners with appropriate recovery and/or sleep-promoting interventions or modulation of match-/training-load. Moreover, subjective rather than objective measures seem to be of greater use to inform player preparedness decision making, particularly at an individual level compared with a group level.","2019","2020-05-20 00:47:54","2020-05-20 00:47:54","","1043-1055","","4","33","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1519/JSC.0000000000002276; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L627043059","adult; human; male; football; exercise; heart rate; young adult; physiology; psychology; fatigue; exercise test; rest; myalgia; sleep; travel; jet lag","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Subjective wellness, acute: chronic workloads and injury risk in college football. J Strength Cond Res 33(12): 3367-3373, 2019-Acute:chronic workload ratios (ACWRs) are associated with injury risk across team sports. In this study, one season of workload and wellness data from 42 collegiate football players were retrospectively analyzed. Daily 7:21 day exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) ACWRs were calculated, and z-score fluctuations (""normal,"" ""better,"" and ""worse"") in sleep, soreness, energy, and overall wellness were assessed relative to the previous day ACWRs and considered as an interactive effect on the risk of noncontact injury within 0-3 days. Fifty-five noncontact injuries were observed, and injury risks were very likely higher when ACWRs were 2 SDs above (relative risk [RR]: 3.05, 90% confidence interval [CI]: 1.14-8.16) and below (RR: 2.49, 90% CI: 1.11-5.58) the mean. A high ACWR was trivially associated (p < 0.05) with ""worse"" wellness (r = -0.06, CI: -0.10 to -0.02), muscle soreness (r = -0.07, CI: -0.11 to -0.03), and energy (r = -0.05, CI: -0.09 to -0.01). Feelings of ""better"" overall wellness and muscle soreness with collectively high EWMA ACWRs displayed likely higher injury risks compared with ""normal"" (RR: 1.52, 90% CI: 0.91 to 2.54; RR: 1.64, 90% CI: 1.10-2.47) and likely or very likely (RR: 2.36, 90% CI: 0.83 to 674; RR: 2.78, 90% CI: 1.21-6.38) compared with ""worse"" wellness and soreness, respectively. High EWMA ACWRs increased injury risk and negatively impacted wellness. However, athletes reporting ""better"" wellness, driven by ""better"" muscle soreness presented with the highest injury risk when high EWMA ACWRs were observed. This suggests that practitioners are responsive to, and/or athletes are able to self-modulate workload activities.","2019","2020-05-20 00:47:56","2020-05-20 00:47:56","","3367-3373","","12","33","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1519/JSC.0000000000003000; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629953847","human; male; football; sport injury; injury; workload; young adult; retrospective study; fatigue; risk factor; university; myalgia; sleep; health status","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, little is known about the magnitude, duration, and nature by which subsequent injury risk is increased. Purpose: To quantify and describe the risk of injury in a 12-week period after RTP from an index injury in Australian football players. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: Injury data were collected from 79 players over 5 years at 1 Australian Football League club. Injuries were classified with the Orchard Sports Injury Classification System and by side of the body. Furthermore, injury severity was classified as time loss (resulting in ≥1 matches being missed) or non–time loss (no matches missed). Subsequent injury was categorized with the SIC-2.0 model and applied to the data set via an automated script. The probability of a time loss subsequent injury was calculated for in-season index injuries for each week of a 12-week period after RTP via a mixed effect logistic regression model. Results: Subsequent injury risk was found to be highest in the week of RTP for both time loss injuries (9.4%) and non–time loss injuries (6.9%). Risk decreased with each week survived after RTP; however, it did not return to baseline risk of participation (3.6%). Conclusion: These findings demonstrate that athletes returning to play are at an increased risk of injury for a number of weeks, thus indicating the requirement for tertiary prevention strategies to ensure that they survive this period.

Consequently, the number of top division games that temporally overlap with lower division games has increased significantly during recent years. By using attendance data of around 6,000 games in Germany's fourth division, this article is the first to empirically test whether such overlaps have any adverse demand effects for lower division games. Fixed effects panel regressions reveal that overlapping games indeed reduce the demand for lower division games, suggesting some negative spillovers of commercialization processes in football.

Aims: As whole-body electrostimulation (WB-EMS) training provides a time efficient stimulation potentially capable in exerting skeletal muscle adaptations we aimed to test this approach over 7 weeks in trained male soccer players during a competitive season. Hypothesis: We hypothesized that a superimposed WB-EMS will increase maximal strength and type I and type II myofiber hypertrophy. Methods: Twenty-eight male field soccer players were assigned in either a WB-EMS group (EG, n = 10), a training group (TG, n = 10), or a control group (CG, n = 8). The regular soccer training consists of two to four sessions and one match per week. In concurrent, the EG performed 3 × 10 squat jumps superimposed with WB-EMS twice per week, TG performed 3 × 10 squat jumps without EMS twice per week, and the CG only performed the regular soccer training. Muscle biopsies were collected and strength tests were performed under resting conditions before (Baseline) and after the intervention period (Posttest). Muscle biopsies were analyzed via western blotting and immunohistochemistry for skeletal muscle adaptive responses. To determine the effect of the training interventions a 2 × 3 (time∗ group) mixed ANOVA with repeated measures was conducted. Results: Maximal strength in leg press (p = 0.009) and leg curl (p = 0.026) was significantly increased in EG along with a small but significant increase in type II myofiber diameter (p = 0.023). All of these adaptations were not observed in TG and CG. Conclusion: WB-EMS can serve as a time efficient training method to augment strength capacities and type II fiber myofiber growth in soccer players when combined with specific resistance training. This combination may therefore be a promising training modification compared to traditional strength training for performance enhancement.","2019","2020-05-20 00:48:16","2020-05-20 00:48:16","","","","SEP","10","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2019.01187; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629509208","adult; human; human experiment; male; article; soccer player; controlled study; analysis of variance; resistance training; muscle strength; normal human; anthropometry; muscle cell; descriptive research; intervention study; electrostimulation; immunohistochemistry; mTOR signaling; muscle biopsy; superimposed whole body electrostimulation; type II fiber myofiber growth; Western blotting","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Notably prior literature indicates an unexplained disparity in time lost to injury for syndesmotic pathologies: Wright et al. (2004) reported a mean return-to-play time of 45 days for 14 examined NHL players, whereas Osbahr et al. (2013) reported a mean return-to-play time of 15 days for 36 examined NFL players. Specifically we posit that patterns of injury, verified by expert MRI evaluation, account for the greater time losses reported among NHL athletes, when compared to NFL athletes. Methods: We reviewed the injury databases of the Pittsburgh Penguins and Pittsburgh Steelers in order to identify athletes who incurred syndesmotic injuries (without co-existing pathology) within the last 10 years. To be eligible for the study, subjects must have received diagnostic MRI imaging within 7 days of injury and no prior history of ipsilateral syndesmotic injury. We then extracted the following data: return-to-practice time (days), age, height, weight, position within sport, date of injury, side of injury, proportion of season remaining, mechanism of injury, and MRI studies. The MRI studies evaluated injuries to the AITFL, PITFL, interosseous membrane, and interosseous ligament, as well as edema height and syndesmotic widening. We generated descriptive statistics of the outcome variables and predictors, including frequencies and proportions for categorical variables and measures of central tendency and dispersion for continuous variables. We assessed univariable measures of association of the predictors with each sport, using the appropriate non-parametric tests for small sample sizes (Mood's median test and Fisher's exact test for continuous and categorical predictors, respectively). We then tested differences in returnto- play by sport using survival analysis methods using Kaplan-Meier Estimators and later Cox Proportional Hazards (CPH) Regression Models, allowing us to model time-to-return as a function of multiple continuous and discrete predictors. Results: The initial investigation revealed nine professional hockey and thirty-three professional football players that suffered injuries over the course of the ten-year study horizon. The median return-to-play times were 34 days (mean=35.2, range=1-79) and 11 days (mean=14.8, range=1-68) for hockey and football athletes, respectively. Non-parametric univariable analysis indicated preferential involvement of the PITFL (p<.05) and minimal syndesmotic width widening (p<.05) among NHL athletes. Sport-specific survival curves indicated statistically significant differences in return-to-play time between the second and fourth weeks of recovery, further supported by the statistical significance of sport (p<.05) as a predictor of return-to-play time in the regression analyses. Conclusion: Our study, unique in its direct access to injury databases of two professional teams from different sports, confirms a known disparity in recovery times among professional athletes. Specifically the results suggest that the preferential involvement of the PITFL combined with a lesser degree of syndesmotic widening in NHL athletes may account for the greater time losses, when compared to NFL athletes.","2019","2020-05-20 00:48:49","2020-05-20 00:48:49","","","","7","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2325967119S00427; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629239151","adult; conference abstract; football player; human; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; controlled study; season; mood; professional athlete; nonhuman; nonparametric test; injury severity; statistical significance; Kaplan Meier method; sample size; edema; ligament; ankle injury; hockey player; outcome variable; median test; penguin","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: A systems approach was taken to assess what different stakeholders within rugby systems perceive their roles to be regarding concussion identification and treatment. Through an online survey, 118 members of the amateur (community) rugby union system were asked about their role-specific concussion management responsibilities and strategies. Respondents included players, parents, medics, coaches, club managers, administrators, and volunteers. Results: The majority of respondents indicated that they were able to identify the symptoms of rugby-related concussion, however, only medics stated their responsibility to use formal concussion assessments (e.g., SCAT2). A smaller number of the respondents indicated that they were involved in treating concussion within their current role/s (majority of which were medics). Conclusions: This study illustrated that the current challenges in the identification and treatment of rugby-related concussion in community sport may be due to role/responsibility confusion and possible overreliance on field-side medics.

While there is pressing need to gain greater understanding of NDD risks from contact sport participation, these must be read in context of wider lifelong health outcomes. Football's InfluencE on Lifelong health and Dementia risk (FIELD) is a retrospective cohort study accessing comprehensive, electronic medical and death records of NHS Scotland. All Scottish professional association footballers (soccer players) born between 01/01/1900 and 31/12/1976 (n = 9,670) were identified from the National Football Museum and professional football club archives. Players were each matched to 3 population controls and records interrogated for a range of outcomes. Pilot observations on a sample cohort, born between 1900 and 1930 (n = 504), demonstrates life expectancy in footballers from this era as 76.2 (-10.6) years, compared with a predicted life expectancy from population modelling of 64.4 (- 1.0) years; representing an average increase in actual versus predicted life expectancy of 11.8 (- 10.5) years (p < 0.001; paired t-test). Interrogation of the data is now being pursued to address the primary aims of FIELD. These data demonstrate that participation in contact sport (soccer) at elite level is associated with increased life expectancy. As such, while studies focus on NDD risk in former athletes, these risks must be balanced against lifelong health outcomes from physical activity to generate appropriately informed, balanced risk assessments.","2019","2020-05-20 00:49:00","2020-05-20 00:49:00","","A100","","13","36","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2019.29100.abstracts; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628868109","conference abstract; football player; human; public health; soccer player; physical activity; controlled study; major clinical study; cohort analysis; risk assessment; retrospective study; contact sport; chronic traumatic encephalopathy; nerve degeneration; death; life expectancy; information center; population dynamics; Scotland","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The data were gathered using player tracking systems (1 Hz) in a standardized 11 vs. 11 soccer game. The KPIs were measured using dynamical positioning variables like Effective Playing Space, Player Length per Width ratio, Team Separateness, Space Control Gain, and Pressure Passing Efficiency. Within the experimental positional data analysis paradigm, neither of the team formations showed differences in Effective Playing Space, Team Separateness, or Space Control Gain. However, as a theory-based approach predicted, a 3-5-2 formation for the Player Length per Width ratio and Pressure Passing Efficiency exceeded the 4-2-3-1 formation. Practice task designs which manipulate team formations therefore significantly influence the emergent behavioral dynamics and need to be considered when planning and monitoring performance. Accordingly, an experimental positional data analysis paradigm is a useful approach to enable the development and validation of theory-oriented models in the area of performance analysis in sports games.","2019","2020-05-20 00:49:04","2020-05-20 00:49:04","","","","1","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0210191; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L626145928","human; theoretical study; article; soccer; controlled study; monitoring; validation process; data analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study is the first of its kind to evaluate the efficacy of the Talent Development Environment Questionnaire (TDEQ) as a tool to help coaches and support staff gain feedback, structure interventions, and evaluate impact over a 12-month period of an international elite TDE. Sixteen full time professional male rugby union players, the Chief Rugby Operations Officer, General Manager of Rugby Performance, and the Head of the Elite Rugby Program participated in the research. The TDEQ baseline results identified 17 weaknesses and nine strengths. Subsequently, an evidence based intervention designed by a staff and player working group was implemented. After the 12-month intervention, there were five weaknesses and 18 strengths with seven targeted and five non-targeted TDEQ items showing statistically significant improvements. Implications for practioners and policy makers on the use of the TDEQ as a mechanism for evidence based impact on evaluation, intervention design, and monitoring in elite TDEs are discussed.

The successful identification of potential future elite athletes at an early age would help to provide high-quality coaching and training environments in which to optimize their development. However, a large variety of different skills and qualities are needed to succeed in elite sports, making talent identification generally a complex and multifaceted problem. Due to the rarity of elite athletes, datasets are inherently imbalanced, making classical statistical inference difficult. Therefore, we approach talent identification as an anomaly detection problem. We trained a nonlinear one-class support vector machine (one-class SVM) on a dataset (N=951) collected from 14-year-old junior soccer players to detect potential future elite players. The mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) over the tested hyperparameter combinations was 0.763 (std 0.007). The most accurate model was obtained when physical tests, measuring, for example, technical skills, speed, and agility, were used. According to our results, the proposed approach could be useful to support decision-makers in the process of talent identification.

In this study, which is quantitative research type, relational scanning model was used from General scanning models. The research group was composed of 296 football fans, including 206 men and 90 women based in Kayseri province. The group formation was carried out by an easily accessible state sampling method from non-selective sampling methods. Survey was used as a data collection tool in the research. The questionnaire forms were delivered by the researcher to the individuals by face-to-face interview method. In addition to the 'Personal Information Form' for demographic characteristics of individuals, the measurement tool includes ""Sport Fan Identification Scale"" to measure the level of supporter identification of individuals, ""Life Satisfaction Scale"" to measure the level of life satisfaction of individuals, and ""Leisure Time Satisfaction Scale"" to measure the level of free time satisfaction of individuals. Descriptive and inferential statistics were made using the SPSS program for the data obtained in the study. According to the results of the analysis of the data obtained; the variables of membership in the fan group, education level, gender, going to away matches, frequency of watching the matches on the spot affect the level of identification of the fans. Positive correlations were found between the level of identification with teams of fans, the level of leisure time satisfaction, and life satisfaction. However, it was also determined that the level of supporter identification and leisure time satisfaction had a significant predictor effect on cohabitation satisfaction. These results show that the sense of adoration and the amount of satisfaction experienced in leisure times interact with the concept of life satisfaction, which concerns the entire life of the individual.

METHODS: In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design, 10 male professional soccer players from the reserve team of an English Premier League Club (age 19 ± 1 y, height 1.8 ± 0.6 m, body mass 77.3 ± 6.4 kg) consumed 2 × 30-mL servings of TCJ or an isocaloric cherry-flavored control drink (CON) before and after a 90-min match, and 12 and 36 h after the match. Muscle function (countermovement jump-height [CMJ], reactive strength index [RSI]), subjective well-being, and subjective muscle soreness (MS) were measured before and 12, 36, and 60 h after each match. RESULTS: CMJ height was similarly reduced in the days after the match after TCJ and CON supplementation, with the greatest loss occurring at 12 h postmatch (-5.9% ± 3.1% vs -5.4% ± 2.9% of baseline values, respectively; P = .966, ηp2 = .010). Decrements in RSI were also greatest at 12 h postmatch (TCJ -9.4% ± 8.4% vs CON -13.9% ± 4.8% of baseline values), but no group differences were observed at any time point (P = .097, ηp2 = .205). MS increased 12-60 h postmatch in both groups, peaking at 12 h postmatch (TCJ 122 ± 27 mm vs CON 119 ± 22 mm), but no group differences were observed (P = .808, ηp2 = .024). No interaction effects were observed for subjective well-being (P = .874, ηp2 = .025). CONCLUSIONS: Tart cherry juice did not hasten recovery after a soccer match in professional players. These findings bring into question the use of TCJ as a recovery aid in professional soccer players.","2019","2020-05-20 00:49:23","2020-05-20 00:49:23","","1-21","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1123/ijspp.2019-0221; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628325830","adult; human; male; article; soccer player; controlled study; team sport; young adult; height; muscle function; double blind procedure; muscle injury; crossover procedure; wellbeing; placebo; inflammation; cherry juice; polyphenol; visually impaired person","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Team dynamics, running, and skill-related performances of Brazilian U11 to professional soccer players during official matches. J Strength Cond Res 33(8): 2202-2216, 2019-Analyses of movements during soccer competition have been used previously to help develop conditioning programs. However, this has not been extensively studied in youth populations. Therefore, the purposes of this study were to examine (1) dynamics of collective tactical movements, (2) running, and (3) skill-related performances during soccer matches disputed by children to senior players. A total of 120 Brazilian players in the age groups U11, U13, U15, U17, U20, and professional (PRO) were monitored during official competition matches (N = 12). Using semiautomatic video-based tracking (30 Hz), match running variables including total distance traveled, average speed, maximum sprint speed, and high-intensity activities were evaluated. Tactical metrics were computed as team surface area, spread, and median frequency. Through notational analysis, technical skills such as involvements with the ball, passes, ball touches, duels, and goal attempts were also recorded. One-way analysis of variance and magnitude-based inferences were used to detect differences between ages. Although the average speed, team surface area, and spread tended to present stabilized increases from the U15 (e.g., U15 > U13 > U11), maximal sprinting speed (PRO > U17 > U15, U13, U11) and percentage at very high-intensity activities (U20 > PRO, U17 > U15 > U13 > U11) demonstrated continuous gains. Median frequencies were higher in the younger groups (U13, U15, U17 > U20, PRO), although the percentage of successful passes was higher in the older groups (PRO > U17, U15 > U13, U11). We concluded that Brazilian U11 to PRO players present different performance profiles for running, collective movement dynamics, and technical skills, and that the rate of development regarding these components varies. Coaches should be aware of these differences to select and adapt training content for each age group.","2019","2020-05-20 00:49:41","2020-05-20 00:49:41","","2202-2216","","8","33","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1519/JSC.0000000000002577; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628894420","adult; human; male; soccer; adolescent; young adult; Brazil; physiology; running; child; age; athletic performance; videorecording; movement (physiology)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Number of tries scored was the most significant (p <.0001) predictor of all five team success characteristics. Univariate analysis also identified stolen line-outs, tackles completed percentage, line breaks, tackle breaks, turnovers won, and total mauls as significant predictors of team success. Multiple regression analysis of performance indicators for team success suggested that team success is multifactorial, and selected performance indicators constitute independent aspects for winning the game. Different sets of performance indicators selected for points scored versus points conceded suggested performance indicators that are significantly associated with offensive and defensive capabilities, respectively. The most important indicators of defensive performance are line-outs stolen and percentage of tackles completed, while line breaks are the most important indicator of offensive performance. Improving offensive capability must be focused on achieving line and tackle breaks. Conversely, to improve defensive performance, the focus must be on stealing opposition line-outs and effective tackling.

Eighty three technical and tactical performance variables were measured in 13 teams during 26 league and championship games throughout 2014–2015. Univariate analysis of full-games revealed that winners achieved a significantly higher total score, number of scores, shots, points, points from play and goals, resulting in superior shot efficiency, average attack per score, and scores per 10 possessions. Winners gained significantly more turnovers and completed significantly less unsuccessful hand passes. Winners also performed significantly less kick outs, resulting in fewer successful kick outs and successful dead ball kick passes overall. A principal component analysis, conducted on 18 variables produced 4 components, which explained 81.9% of the variance. Both logistic regression (8.00, χ2(1) = 16.00, p < 0.001) and discriminant analysis (Ʌ = 0.53, χ2(1) = 13.77, p < 0.001) revealed that one component, defensive counterattacking, significantly contributed to outcome and differentiated winners from losers with a cross-validation accuracy of 87.5%. Coaches can use this information to organise their defensive system to generate opposition turnovers and also incorporate sufficient flexibility to facilitate effective transitions to exploit their own offensive counterattacking opportunities.

Data were collected from the Chinese Super League. Technical and physical match-performances were analysed using independent / paired t-tests for the following groups: starters (n = 4,794) vs. substitutes (n = 1,208); whole-match players (n = 3,505) vs. substitutes (n = 1,208); within-player comparisons: starters (n = 258) vs. substitutes (n = 258). Significant differences were identified between substitutes and starters/whole-match players for central defenders (number of shots, total distance), central midfielders (high-intensity and total distance, number of high-intensity runs and sprints), wide-midfielders (high-intensity distance, number of high-intensity runs and sprints) and forwards (number of forward passes). Significant differences were identified during within-player comparisons for fullbacks (shot success, ground challenges success), central midfielders (number of passes, shots, aerial challenges and ground challenges), wide midfielders (number of high-intensity runs, sprint % of distance) and forwards (sprint % of distance, number of shots).

Chi-square and univariate general linear methods were used for the data analysis. Statistical difference is observed in the number of goals scored between the two halves (X²=8.699, p<0.005). A comparable percentage of scoring in most of the periods with the exceptions of the periods in overtime, the period from the 16th to 30th min, the additional time of the first and second half and the period from the 76th to 90th min of the game was determined (p<0.01). The teams that scored first won 71.4% matches, lost 9.5% and had a tie 19% of the matches (X²=42.000, p<0.001). Most of the goals were scored following a corner kick (24), penalty (22) and free kick scored non-directly (16), which were significantly different from free kick scored directly (6) and throw in (2) (X²=26.857, p<0.001). 19 goals were scored from cross, 19 from a long-range shot (8 of them with the ""inner foot""), 18 from a forward pass and 12 from cutback. Statistical differences between the first four groups and all of the others are determined (X²=27.818, p<0.01). Significant differences were found between the goals that ""began"" from the offensive third, the middle and the defensive third (X²=73.645, p<0.001). 58.9% of the goals are scored following positional play, which is significantly different compared to the counterattack (29.5%) and direct play (11.6%) (X²=32.611, p<0.001). Over 59 goals were scored from ""the inner part of the foot"" or ""place"", and 31 from header, which were significantly different from the other types of shots (X²=89.254, p<0.001).

A set of 20 technical and tactical performance indicators namely; shot back-third, shot mid-third, shot front-third, pass back-third, pass mid-third, pass front-third, shot in box, shot outbox, chances created, interception, turnover, goals scored 1st period, goals scored 2nd period, goals scored 3rd period, goals scored extra time, tackling, fouls committed, complete save, incomplete save and passing error were observed during the beach soccer Asian Football Confederation tournament 2017 held in Malaysia. A total of 23 matches from 12 teams were notated using StatWatch application in real-time. Discriminant analysis (DA) of standard, backward as well stepwise modes were used to develop a model for the winning (WT) and losing team (LT) whilst Mann-Whitney U test was utilized to ascertain the differences between the WT and LT with respect to the performance indicators evaluated. The standard backward, forward and stepwise discriminates the WT and the LT with an excellent accuracy of 95.65%, 91.30% and 89.13%, respectively. The standard DA model discriminated the teams from seven performance indicators whilst both the backward and forward stepwise identified two performance indicators. The Mann-Whitney U test analysis indicated that the WT is statistically significant from the LT based on the performance indicators determined from the standard mode model of the DA. It was demonstrated that seven performance indicators namely; shot front-third, pass front-third, chances created, goals scores at the 1st period, goals scored at the 2nd period, goals scored at 3rd period were directly linked to a successful performance whilst the incomplete save by the keeper attribute towards the poor performance of the team. The present finding could serve useful to the coaches as well as performance analysts as a measure of profiling successful performance and enables team improvement with respect to the associated performance indicators.","2019","2020-05-20 00:50:07","2020-05-20 00:50:07","","","","6","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0219138; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002368533","article; football; soccer; competition; rank sum test; Malaysia; turnover rate; seashore; protein fingerprinting; discriminant analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Top-level male football players (n = 202) that completed the full 90-min game were considered. Match-analysis data were collected using OPTA Sportsdata (). Kruskal–Wallis H non-parametric test revealed that external midfielders (EM) scored more goals than fullbacks (FB) (p = 0.042), and that FB had less attempts (to score a goal) than central midfielders (CM), EM and forwards (FW), whereas central defenders (CD) had less attempts than FW (p < 0.05). CM performed more passes than CD, EM and FW, while FW performed less passes than CD, FB and CM. CD and CM performed more successful passes than FB and FW (p < 0.05), and CM also had more passes than EM (p < 0.05). Moreover, FW had more aerial duels (50–50 contests) than CM, FB and EM (p < 0.05). Similar numbers of aerial duels occurred for CD and FW. Ground duels occurred less (p < 0.05) frequently for CD compared to FB, CM, EM and FW. In conclusion, differences in technical events were observed between the various playing positions during competitive elite football matches, making it valuable considering the technical demands of players during group training as well as individualised training.

This growth was marked by the inclusion of the sport in the Olympic Games in 2016. The most frequently occurring contact events in Sevens are the tackle and ruck. Performing specific techniques during these contact events can reduce the risk of injury and increase the likelihood of success. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to identify the technical determinants associated with tackle and ruck performance outcomes in Sevens. A total of 4799 tackles and 1405 rucks from the 2014/2015 HSBC Sevens World Series were coded for contact, post-contact, ruck, match contextual variables and outcomes. Relative risk ratio (RR), the ratio of the probability of an outcome occurring when a variable was observed, was determined using multinomial logistic regression. A moderate ball-carrier leg drive reduced the probability of losing possession by 25% (RR 0.75, 95% CI, 0.58-0.97, p < .05). Conversely, ball-carriers had a 53% higher likelihood of losing possession when the tackler executed a moderate leg drive (RR 1.53, 95% CI, 1.09-2.14, p ≤ .05). Maintaining possession at the ruck was more likely to occur when committing one attacker compared to two (RR 0.31, 95% CI, 0.19-0.49, p < .001). Active ball-carrier placement also increased the likelihood of maintaining possession at the ruck (RR 14.67, 95% CI, 9.55-22.56, p < .001). Sevens coaches and trainers can now positively design evidence-based technical training programmes and emphasise specific tackle techniques in training using data from Sevens video analysis. Also, given that this is the first study to relate tackle technical determinants to an outcome (i.e. the first 'how' study) in Sevens, this work provides the foundation for similar Sevens video analysis studies in the future.","2019","2020-05-20 00:50:13","2020-05-20 00:50:13","","1-12","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17461391.2019.1675764; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629733185","human; article; rugby; injury; controlled study; training; leg; risk factor; videorecording; probability; skill","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, without an exhaustive analysis of reality, the view can lead to the extraction of erroneous conclusions, and what seems to be a team with a marked offensive profile is a mere illusion, resulting to be a team that develops a perfectly balanced game. In this paper, an analysis of technical-tactical performance of players who occupied both wings in an elite team was made, taking as reference the Spanish national soccer team as the model of international game to imitate in the last decade. The development of this paper was located within the observational methodology, using the polar coordinates technique for the analysis of the obtained data. The results showed how, despite identifying offensive profiles within technical-tactical performance of players that occupied the outer wings or lanes of the playing field, their tactical means and orientations diverged from each other. The results showed a more offensive profile and with higher technical complexity of players that occupied the left wing, while players that held the right wing showed a more defensive and recuperative profile, indicating a less vertical and complex style of play at a technical level with the forward as an offensive reference.

Methods: Publicly available records were used to identify MLS players who underwent Achilles tendon repair with a minimum of 1 year follow-up. Demographic and performance data were collected for each player. Matched controls were identified. RTS was defined as playing in one or more MLS games after surgery. Comparisons between case and control groups and preoperative and postoperative time points were made using paired sample Student's t-tests. Results: Twenty-two players (mean age 28.4±4.0 years; mean 3.0±2.2 years follow-up) and 23 Achilles tendon repairs (one bilateral repair) were analysed. Seventeen players (18 Achilles tendon repairs; 77.3%) were able to RTS in the MLS at mean 306.6±199.2 days. Players who RTS after repair had shorter careers than matched controls (2.5±2.2 vs 4.5±3.0 seasons, respectively; p=0.021). Additionally, players who RTS after repair played in fewer games per season than matched controls (13.4±8.4 vs 23.2±6.5, respectively; p<0.001). There was no significant decrease in performance postsurgery compared with presurgery. Conclusion: There is a 77.3% RTS rate in the MLS following Achilles tendon repair.

The aim of this research was to determine the peak movement demands of professional and semi-professional rugby league competition. Wearable microtechnology devices tracked the physical activity profiles of players during 26 professional (n = 351 files) and 22 semi-professional (n = 267 files) matches. Following each match, data were exported in raw form to extract the peak 1-to 10-min periods for speed, average acceleration, and accelerometer load of each player, using a rolling average method. To determine the difference between playing levels (professional vs. semi-professional) and position (forwards vs. backs), linear mixed models were used. The intercept and the slope were calculated based on the power law relationship to provide the peak, and rate of decay, of each dependent variable. Cohen’s effect size (ES) statistic was used to determine the magnitude of differences between positions and playing level. There was little difference between playing standards, with only small differences in running speed, with a greater intercept and slope for the professional forwards compared with semi-professional forwards (intercept ES: 0.37; 90%CL: 0.19 to 0.55; slope ES: 0.35; 0.15 to 0.55). For positional comparisons (forwards vs. backs), there was no difference in running speeds at the professional level, but there was substantially greater running speed for backs compared to forwards in semi-professional competition, with small to moderate differences (ES range: 0.60–0.39). Both professional and semi-professional forwards showed small to moderately higher accelerometer load compared to backs, which increased with period duration (ES range: 0.22–0.79). Similarly, acceleration demands were greater for forwards compared to backs across both playing standards, with moderate to large differences (ES range: 0.52–0.96). Overall, the results of this study show that there is a small difference in the peak running speed for forwards in professional competition, but otherwise there are no meaningful differences in movement demands of professional and semi-professional rugby league match-play. Forwards display greater acceleration and accelerometer load across a number of rolling average durations compared to backs.","2019","2020-05-20 00:52:31","2020-05-20 00:52:31","","","","OCT","10","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2019.01285; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629823755","human; article; rugby; acceleration; major clinical study; team sport; accelerometer; competition; running; effect size; dependent variable; microtechnology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It therefore follows that we need initiatives that enhance levels of social capital, positive social identities and social inclusion within the community, not just within mental health services. These initiatives must bring people together in ways that allow them to feel that they have ownership of any new social infrastructures and use evidence-based frameworks to evaluate them. One context that has been given some consideration is the use of community sport. This paper therefore contributes to the steadily growing literature in this area by exploring the specifics of a community mental health football project, through the utilisation of the personal and social recovery frameworks that have been established within the ‘mainstream’ mental health evidence base. This relativist study utilised seventeen semi-structured interviews (with participants and staff) and, as a deliberate departure from existing research, chose to adopt a deductive, theoretical approach to the analysis that located the data within the personal recovery and social recovery literature. Both participants and staff were considerably positive about the sessions, and data suggested an adherence to the empirically based CHIME personal recovery framework. In terms of alignment with the social recovery concepts, the data was particularly robust in supporting active citizenship processes, which can increase levels of social capital and enhance social identities. Future work is required to further explore the contextual impact of poverty and employment, and the role that sport can potentially play.","2019","2020-05-20 00:52:38","2020-05-20 00:52:38","","","","","17","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mhpa.2019.100292; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002026663","adult; female; human; human experiment; male; theoretical study; article; football; remission; semi structured interview; social status; staff; poverty; citizenship; community mental health; social capital","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Women's Football Committee in the Polish Football Association has developed a long-term strategic plan to popularize the discipline across the country and enhance girls' participation. On one hand, it is postulated to increase the number of female footballers, and on the other hand, it is crucial to decrease the number of girls quitting football prematurely. OBJECTIVE: To find the reasons for sports career termination among female football players. DESIGN: Cross-sectional with retrospective information about reasons of career termination. SETTING: Online questionnaire was filled out by online access. PARTICIPANTS: Ninety-three former female footballers. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Factors leading to career termination. METHODS: Participants completed the online questionnaire. The analysis was performed referring to 2 groups: ""injury group""-in which the injury was the main reason for quitting football, and ""other group""-in which the female player stopped playing football due to all other factors. RESULTS: Thirty percent of former Polish female football players terminated their career due to a long-term treatment for an injury. Over 27% (27.7%) females had ended their careers because they were not able to reconcile sports with work/studying. Over 10% (10.8%) of former football players reported that becoming a wife and/or mother was the reason for career termination. Losing motivation and interest in the sport was reported by 9.2% (n = 6) of present study participants who decided to terminate the career due to noninjury reasons. CONCLUSIONS: The results clearly show that more effort is needed to support female football players, especially after an injury, so that they do not quit the sport voluntarily.","2019","2020-05-20 00:52:45","2020-05-20 00:52:45","","109-114","","2","28","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1123/jsr.2017-0190; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L626102878","adult; female; human; soccer; sport injury; injuries; adolescent; athlete; young adult; decision making; questionnaire; retrospective study; cross-sectional study; middle aged; Poland","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of a short-term, three-week intensive neuromuscular training programme on the postural stability of professional soccer players and to establish whether lower-limb dominance affects one-leg stability. Material and methods. The experimental group consisted of 16 professional male soccer players, and the control group included 20 professional soccer players who did not undergo any additional training. The experimental group was provided with three-stage progressive training twice a day over a three-week period during the preparatory period and then trained twice per week in-season for a period of 5 months. The experimental subjects were evaluated with the use of a stabilographic platform before the programme, 3 weeks into the programme, and finally after 5 months from its commencement. Total centre of pressure (COP) sway path was measured during one leg stance for the dominant and non-dominant leg with eyes open and closed. Results. After three weeks of training, the experimental group showed a significantly shorter COP path for the measurements taken with both open (p < 0.001; η2 = 0.28) and closed eyes (p < 0.05; η2 = 0.09) compared to the initial results. It was found that the training effects were sustained five months into the training programme for the tests with eyes open (p < 0.001) and eyes closed (p < 0.05). The control group, however, showed no such improvement during that time. No differences were found between the limbs in either of the groups. Conclusions. Neuromuscular training can be effective for postural control improvement in professional male soccer players within a short period of time. Leg dominance does not affect one-leg stability.

Methods: NFL injury reports and injury reserve data were collected for every NFL player, on all 32 NFL teams, for each week during the regular season, for the 2012–2013, 2013–2014, 2014–2015, 2015–2016, and 2016–2017 NFL seasons. Injuries were defined as any reported injury, not previously documented in an injury report prior to said injury. Calculated injury rates per 1000 athletic exposures for Sunday and Monday night games versus Thursday night games was used to generate relative risk of injury using 95% confidence intervals. Results: The all-cause injury rate during NFL Sunday and Monday Night Football games was found to be 7,598 per 1000 athletic exposures, while the all-cause injury rate during Thursday Night Football games was found to be 6,072 per 1,000 athletic exposures. The relative risk of injury during Thursday Night Football games was calculated to be 0.97 compared to Sunday and Monday night games. Therefore, the rate of injury during Thursday Night Football games was significantly less than the rate of injury during Sunday and Monday night games, despite the lack of additional recovery time. Conclusion: This study suggests that eliminating Thursday Night Football is unlikely to improve the statistical injury rate among NFL players.","2019","2020-05-20 00:52:50","2020-05-20 00:52:50","","350-352","","3","47","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00913847.2019.1587565; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L626734538","football player; human; article; football; sport injury; head injury; knee injury; risk factor; information processing; shoulder injury; ankle injury; hip injury; data analysis; all cause injury; toe injury","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Young people are particularly at risk of sports injury because of high levels of exposure at a time of major physiological change. Soccer players are susceptible to a variety of injuries due to contact, aggressive tackle, and high-speed collisions. Aims: The aim of this study was to determine the pattern of presentation, treatment, and outcome of tibial fractures following participation in recreational football activity; with the hope that knowledge gained from this study will help in preventing or reducing its occurrence. Patients and Methods: This is a retrospective study of all cases of tibial fractures following participation in recreational football presenting to the Orthopedic Unit of Federal Medical Center and Surgery Department of Sir Yahaya Memorial Hospital all in Birnin Kebbi, Kebbi State, north western Nigeria; from January 2012 to December 2017. Data were extracted from the accident and emergency register, operation register, and patients' case folders on biodata, diagnosis, mechanism of injury, associated injuries, type of surgical procedure, site of surgery, date of surgery, and postoperative complications. Data collected were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences for Windows version 22. Results were presented with descriptive statistics. Results: In total, 37 patients were included in the study. All of them were males. The age range is from 14 to 33 years with mean age of 23.6. 17 (45.9%) of the patients are in the 21- to 30-year age group. The right tibia was affected in 34 (91.9%) patients. None of the patients used shin guard. The mechanism of injury in all the cases was direct contact. About 31 (83.8%) of the fractures were closed. Seven (18.9%) of these patients were discharged against medical advice. Nineteen (51.3%) patients were managed nonoperatively with plaster of Paris casts. Ten (27.1%) of these patients had internal fixation with locked intramedullary nail. Conclusion: Tibial fractures following football occur mostly in males especially adolescents and youths. The right tibia was commonly affected and most of the injuries are closed. The most common mechanism of injury was direct contact.","2019","2020-05-20 00:52:54","2020-05-20 00:52:54","","492-495","","4","22","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.4103/njcp.njcp_148_18; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L627362274","adult; female; human; male; football; soccer; tibia fracture; injury; incidence; injuries; adolescent; young adult; retrospective study; recreation; osteosynthesis; postoperative complication; treatment outcome; Nigeria; calcium sulfate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The SLJ, THT, 5-m, and 20-m speed, and Y-BT scores showed high relative and absolute reliability. The usefulness analysis showed that the SLJ, THT, 5-m and 20-m speed, and Y-BT tests could detect small changes in performance (SEM < SWC for all tests). Phase 2 showed that leg power, speed, and postural control are affected by time of day. A significantly better (p< 0.05) leg power, speed, and postural control were observed at the end of the afternoon than at morning hours.

To measure peak velocity in soccer, let the players sprint. J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2019-Expressing externals loads relative to a player's individual capacities has potential to enhance understanding of dose-response. Peak velocity is an important metric for the individualization process and is usually measured during a sprint test. Recently, however, peak velocity was reported to be faster during soccer matches when compared with a 40-m sprint test. With the aim of developing the practice of individualized training prescription and match evaluation, we examined whether the aforementioned finding replicates in a group of elite youth soccer players across a broader range of soccer activities. To do this, we compared the peak velocities of 12 full-time male youth soccer players (age 16.3 ± 0.8 years) recorded during a 40-m sprint test with peak velocity recorded during their routine activities (matches, sprints, and skill-based conditioning drills: small-sided games [SSG], medium-sided games [MSG], large-sided games [LSG]). All activities were monitored with 10-Hz global positioning systems (Catapult Optimeye S5, version 7.32) with the highest speed attained during each activity retained as the instantaneous peak velocity. Interpretation of clear between-activity differences in peak velocity was based on nonoverlap of the 95% confidence intervals for the mean difference between activities with sprint testing. Peak velocity was clearly faster for the sprint test (8.76 ± 0.39 m·s) when compared with matches (7.94 ± 0.49 m·s), LSG (6.94 ± 0.65 m·s), MSG (6.40 ± 0.75 m·s), and SSG (5.25 ± 0.92 m·s), but not sprints (8.50 ± 0.36 m·s).

Previous cross-sectional research has shown that some dimensions of burnout and distress fluctuate within a coaching season, while others are largely unaffected. What is unclear is whether the negative health consequences persist over time and how they are expressed at different points of a year. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to clarify the long-term pattern of burnout and mental health symptoms across several coaching seasons. Methods: Coaches were measured during two AFL seasons at quarterly intervals (February, May, August, November), by completing an online survey comprising the 22–item Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) and 21–item Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS). Of the 156 coaches who completed the survey, 50 coaches responded to each of the eight administration points. Factorial ANOVA and trend analysis were conducted to examine longitudinal patterns of burnout and psychological distress. Results: Repeated-measures ANOVA, showed non-significant interactions between time (4) and season (2) for MBI scales: emotional exhaustion (EE); depersonalization (DP); personal accomplishment (PA), and DASS (depression, anxiety, stress) subscales, p >.05, partial ?2 effect sizes were<.09 for all analyses. A main effect of time was found for EE (p =.001), depression (p =.006) and stress (p =.005); partial ?2 were.30,.23 and.24 respectively. A main effect of season was observed only for PA, p =.02, partial ?2 =.10. Polynomial analyses indicated significant quadratic trends for EE, DP and Stress, p <.05. Curve inspection showed an increase in burnout and stress levels from February to August, followed by a decrease at November. Discussion: Taken together, these results suggest a reoccurring pattern across seasons; notably, EE, depression and stress showed concomitant increases towards August - when contract renewals are negotiated - followed by a notable drop in November when coaching pressures reduce. This trend is inline with other research which has also highlighted variable symptom expression and suggests that coaches are resilient to some dimensions of burnout and mental health, but susceptible to others. These findings help pinpoint critical periods during a coaching season and identify the symptoms most likely to affect staff so that mental health programs can be developed accordingly.","2019","2020-05-20 00:53:21","2020-05-20 00:53:21","","S52","","","22","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsams.2019.08.241; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002914894","conference abstract; human; football; controlled study; season; analysis of variance; cross-sectional study; longitudinal study; effect size; anxiety; mental disease; mental stress; depersonalization; Depression Anxiety Stress Scale; emotional stress; professional burnout","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The sample consisted of 10 futsal players from a professional team aged 23.70 ± 5.85 years, 72.33 ± 6.01 kg and 174.40 ± 0.05 cm. Players were monitored for a period of 4 training weeks, corresponding to the beginning of the competitive period. During this period, physical training sought to improve lower limb power. At the beginning and end of the training period, the following tests were performed: Squat jump (SJ), Countermovement jump (CMJ), 15-meter speed (Vel_15m) and Futsal Intermittent Endurance Test (FIET). The training load was monitored by the Session Perceived Exertion method. Weeks 1 and 3 presented higher training load than weeks 2 and 4 (p <0.01). In the post-training period, shorter running time in the Vel_15m test (p = 0.04), greater height in SJ (p <0.01) and CMJ (p <0.01) tests, and higher maximal speed in FIET (p = 0.04) were observed. It could be concluded that directing training at the beginning of the competitive season to improve power increases the lower limb power of futsal players, with consequent improvement of speed and the ability to perform intermittent actions at high intensities. O objetivo do estudo foi analisar o efeito de um período de treinamento direcionado ao desenvolvimento de potência de membros inferiores no desempenho físico de jogadores de futsal. A amostra foi composta por 10 jogadores de futsal de uma equipe profissional com 23,70 ± 5,85 anos, 72,33 ± 6,01 kg e 174,40 ± 0,05 cm. Os jogadores foram monitorados por um período de 4 semanas de treinamento, correspondente ao início do período competitivo. Neste período, o treinamento físico buscou aperfeiçoar a potência de membros inferiores. No início e ao término do período, foram realizados os testes: Squat jump (SJ), Countermovemt jump (CMJ), velocidade de 15 metros (Vel&lowbar;15m) e Futsal Intermitente Endurance Test (FIET). A carga de treinamento foi monitorada pelo método da percepção subjetiva de esforço da sessão. As semanas 1 e 3 apresentaram maior CTST que as semanas 2 e 4 (p < 0,01). No momento pós treinamento, observou-se menor tempo de corrida no teste de Vel&lowbar;15m (p = 0,04), maior altura nos testes SJ (p < 0,01) e CMJ (p < 0,01), e maior velocidade no FIET (p = 0,04). Pode-se concluir que direcionar o treinamento no início da temporada competitiva para melhora da potência proporciona incremento na potência de membros inferiores de jogadores de futsal, com consequente melhora da velocidade e na capacidade de realizar ações intermitentes em alta intensidade.","2019","2020-05-20 00:53:24","2020-05-20 00:53:24","","1-10","","","21","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","","","","https://gateway.library.qut.edu.au/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=c8h&AN=141528649&site=ehost-live&scope=site","Adult; Soccer; Athletes, Professional; Human; Athletic Performance; Adolescence; Training Effect (Physiology); Professional Sports; Athletic Training; Time Factors; Sporting Events; Physical Performance; Muscle Strength -- Evaluation; Aptitude Tests; Athletic Ability -- Evaluation; Exertion -- Evaluation; Jumping -- Evaluation; Lower Extremity -- Physiology; Physical Endurance -- Evaluation; Running -- Evaluation; Squatting -- Evaluation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Session-rating of perceived exertion (s-RPE), internal training load (ITL) and monotony were recorded across 40 training sessions. Mixed-effects modeling was used for data analysis. The athletes performed 33.0 ± 6.9 out of 40 planned training sessions. Most common reasons for absence from training included sickness or minor injuries. Overall, these training sessions summed 2928.7 ± 627.6 minutes. Athletes performed significantly more training sessions at low and moderate intensity zones than at high-intensity zone (p <0.0001). The current data indicate that elite young soccer players perform their training sessions predominantly at the low-intensity zone. Training monitoring is an important aspect of the sport training process evolution. In fact, previous evidence has already shown that an appropriate intensity distribution prevents maladaptation from sports training and may optimize athletic performance. Therefore, coaches should implement strategies to monitor training loads during pre-season and competitive periods. O presente estudo descreveu a carga de treinamento e a distribuição de intensidade de 30 jogadores de elite de futebol sub 20 (17,9 ± 0,6 anos, 180,3 ± 5,7 cm, 73,7 ± 8,8 kg) de um clube de elite do estado de São Paulo. Durante 40 sessões de treinamento, a percepção subjetiva de esforço, bem como a carga interna de treinamento e a monotonia foram registradas. Os dados foram analisados por modelagem linear mista. Os atletas realizaram 33,0 ± 6,9 das 40 sessões de treinamento planejadas. As razões mais comuns para a ausência nas sessões de treinamento incluíram doenças ou lesões leves. De forma geral, essas sessões somaram 2928,7 ± 627,6 minutos. Os atletas realizaram significativamente mais sessões de treinamento em zonas de baixa e moderada intensidade comparado com a zona de alta intensidade (p <0,0001). Os dados do presente estudo indicam que os jovens jogadores de elite realizam suas sessões de treinamento predominantemente na zona de baixa intensidade. O monitoramento do treinamento colabora para a evolução do processo de treinamento esportivo. De fato, evidências anteriores já mostraram que a distribuição de intensidade apropriada impede a mal adaptação ao treinamento esportivo e pode otimizar o desempenho atlético. Portanto, treinadores devem implementar estratégias para monitorar as cargas de treinamento durante os períodos de pré-temporada e de competição.","2019","2020-05-20 00:53:32","2020-05-20 00:53:32","","1-11","","","21","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","","","","https://gateway.library.qut.edu.au/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=c8h&AN=141528630&site=ehost-live&scope=site","Soccer; Human; Athletes, Elite; Athletic Performance; Athletic Injuries; Coaches, Athletic; Data Analysis, Statistical -- Methods; Young Adult; Athletic Training; Sporting Events; Data Analysis; Exercise Intensity -- Evaluation; Exertion -- Evaluation; Workload","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Regarding muscle soreness, almost certain large decreases were found during congested weeks on MD-3 (−21.2%, [−30.0;−11.3]) and MD-1 (−17.3%, [−26.6;−6.9]). Similar evidence was found for fatigue level, as almost certain large decreases were observed during congested weeks on MD-3 (−23.5%, [−32.9;−12.7]) and MD-1 (−16.6%, [−24.8;−7.4]). Within-week changes during normal weeks revealed almost certain large increases in internal load on MD-2 (93.4%, [78.6;109.3]) and MD-3 (106.7%, [88.2;127.0]) in comparison with MD-1. Also, during congested weeks, almost certain large increases of internal load were observed on MD-2 (77.2%, [53.4;104.7]) and MD-3 (65.7%, [42.8;92.3]) in comparison with MD-1. The major findings of this study revealed meaningful increases of IL, muscle soreness, and fatigue in normal weeks in comparison to congested ones. Within-week changes were also observed, with the greatest loads being observed on MD-3 during normal weeks and on MD-2 during congested weeks.","2019","2020-05-20 00:53:38","2020-05-20 00:53:38","","123-129","","","201","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2019.01.001; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2001446357","adult; human; male; article; football; observational study; priority journal; controlled study; prospective study; season; training; athlete; questionnaire; fatigue; stress; comparative study; myalgia; wellbeing; sleep; training load; elite futsal player; muscle soreness","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

K-Track system allows to analyze work time, total workload developed during a session or match, average strength produced, lateral imbalance (left and right), number of vertical jumps, vertical jump accelerations (intensity), number of dives to the right (volume), right dive accelerations (intensity), number of dives to the left (volume) and left dive accelerations (intensity).This parameters it's completely different from other players and it's necessary to have correct information from GK performance. In conclusion how much and how to train the goalkeeper to improve fitness and performance in high-level professional team. Method: Three (n=3) professional goalkeepers were analyzed (age 20.3±1.5 body weight 80.9±7.6 kg; height 188±2.9cm; fat mass 9.4±2.9 %), during 20 workout and 4 official match in season 2019-2020 with K-Track (K-TRACK/IMU K-SPORT UNI.STATS, Montecchio, ITA). Conclusion: This case study has allowed us to highlight which training load is correct for this role during a training week to improve physical performance. In fact, not have specific studies that have analyzed specific parameters for GK, because it is necessary a K-Track device to collect correct information. If we know correct training load, it is possible to improve or reduce exercises intensity and volume. In addition, it is clear that physical and technical-tactical goalkeeper profile is completely different from other players in football.

Professional football players (n = 28) from a first division Brazilian club had RPE collected after training sessions during 10 weeks of the regular season. Athletes were divided in groups according to their playing positions (GK, n = 3; CB, n = 4; FB, n = 5; CMF n = 5; AMF, n = 4; WMF n = 4; and FWD; n = 4).Descriptive analysis of the sample was followed by the application of the Welch's F-Test with Games-Howell post-hoc for RPE analysis of variance across positions. All playing positions reported ""moderate"" as mean- and mode-RPE (GK=3,19±0,64; CB=3,85±1,29; FB=3,87±1,39; CMF=3,99±1,28; AMF=3,78±1,25; WMF=3,59±1,18; FWD = 3,70±1,08), open field positions perceived effort in all intensity zones, while GK perceived sessions within a narrower range of intensities. GK reported significant lower RPE than any other playing position (FGOL, FWD = 18,61; p<0,0001), and CMF reported higher RPE than all others open-field positions, although the difference is only significant with respect to WMF (p<0,05). In conclusion, RPE is influenced by playing position and the physical activity profile performed. GK' lower RPE may be caused by the participation in open-field activities with the group of players as these activities are known to be less demanding than the position-specific training. Therefore, collecting GK' RPE also after the position specific training block can contribute with goalkeepers' coaches in their training planning and load monitoring. Additionally, differences in RPE of CMF and WMF shed a light on the influence of running activity on perceived exertion and its relationship with tactical roles.

The aim of this study was to analyse morphological and motor changes in young elite female football players during preparatory phase of a yearly training cycle. We assumed that preparatory phase in football training causes a decrease in body fat mass, increase in body weight, particularly in muscle mass of lower limbs, as well as an improvement in motor skills, endurance and speed. Methods. The study included elite female football players from KKP MAX-Sprint Bydgoszcz team. Their basic morphological parameters, including body composition and physical performance expressed by outcomes of flexibility, static and explosive strength, speed and endurance EUROFIT battery tests, were documented at two time points: beginning and end of preparatory phase of a yearly training cycle. Data. The Shapiro-Wilk test (assessment of the distribution of variables), Student t-test (assessment of the significance of the dependent variables' differences) and Mollison's index (assessment of the scope of changes of the variables tested) were used. The threshold of statistical significance for all tests was set at 0.05. Results. Morphological changes were manifested mainly by an increase body weight (D = 0.78 kg, p = 0.012) including protein content (D = 0.15 kg, p = 0.005) and in body fluid volume (D = 0.33, p = 0.032) and fat-free mass, particularly in lower limbs (for the right leg D = 0.12 l, p = 0.003; for the left leg D = 0.10 l, p = 0.006). Motor changes were manifested by an improved speed agility (D = 2.79 s, p = 0.000), flexibility (D = 6.25 cm, p = 0.000), explosive strength (D = 8.67 cm, p = 0.001) and static strength (D = 3.00 kG, p = 0.016). Conclusions. A significant increase in muscle mass and speed suggests that football training exerts specific, desirable effects on morphological and motor characteristics in female players. Preparatory phase in football training does not result in unfavourable changes in morphological and motor characteristics in female players.

As a consequence, youth players may still be engaged in other activities and sports throughout the year as they transition to rugby specialisation. Limited research exists quantifying rugby union training and matches as well as engagement in other activities and sports. Therefore, the aim of this study was to quantify and compare rugby union training, matches and other activities of elite youth U15 and U16 rugby union players at different stages of the season. Four-hundred and ninety-two youth (Under-15 and 16-year-old) rugby union players self-reported the frequency, intensity and duration of their participation in rugby union matches, rugby union training, gym, physical education and other sports during three different stages – September to December (Sept–Dec), January to April (Jan–Apr), May to August (May–Aug) – of the year. When all activities were combined, the frequency and volume of rugby matches and training was the greatest during the Sept–Dec stage. The frequency and volume of participating in other sports increased in the May–Aug stage of the season. Gym training frequency, intensity, and duration were stable across the year for both U15 and U16 players. Coaches and practitioners working with elite youth rugby union players should be aware that players are still participating in other activities outside of rugby training and competition. Coaches and practitioners should put structures in place to plan and monitor players' activities in order to optimise the positive outcomes of specialisation (e.g., expertise) while reducing the potential negative outcomes (e.g., injury, burnout).

Twenty-seven professional soccer players (24.9 3.5 years old) were monitored daily using a 10-Hz global positioning system with a 100-Hz accelerometer. Total distance (TD), running distance (RD), high-speed running (HSR), sprinting distance (SD), player load (PL), number of high accelerations (ACC), and number of high decelerations (DEC) were recorded during training sessions and matches. An individual training/match ratio (TMr) was calculated for each external load measure. Weeks with five training sessions (5dW) presented meaningfully greater TMr than weeks with four (4dW) or three (3dW) training sessions. Additionally, TDratio (TDr) was significantly greater in 5dW than in 3dW (mean differences dif: 1.23 arbitray units A.U.) and 4dW (dif: 0.80 A.U.); HSRr was significantly greater in 5dW than in 3dW (dif: 0.90 A.U.) and 4dW (dif: 0.68 A.U.); and SDr was significantly greater in 5dW than in 3dW (dif: 0.77 A.U.) and 4dW (dif: 0.90 A.U.). Correlations between the weekly training loads and the match demands of the same week were small for PL (r = 0.250 [0.13;0.36]), ACC (r = 0.292 [0.17;0.40]) and DEC (r = 0.236 [0.11;0.35]). This study reveals that ratios of above 1 were observed for specific measures (e.g., HSR, SD).

Multilevel SEM was used to examine the relationship between coaches’ transformational leadership style, a task-involving climate, and leadership effectiveness outcome criteria (i.e., players’ extra effort, coach effectiveness, and satisfaction with their coach), separately estimating between and within effects. A representative sample of 625 Spanish male soccer players ranging from 16 to 18 years old and nested in 50 teams completed a questionnaire package tapping the variables of interest. Results confirmed that at the team level, team perceptions of transformational leadership positively predicted teams’ perceptions of task climate, which in turn positively predicted the three outcome criteria. At the individual level, players’ perceptions of transformational leadership positively predicted teams’ perceptions of task climate, which in turn positively predicted teams’ extra effort and coach effectiveness. Mediation effects appeared at the team level for all the outcome criteria, and at the individual only for extra effort. Transformational leadership is recommended to enhance task climate, in order to increase players’ extra effort, their perceptions of the effectiveness of their coach, and their satisfaction with his/her leadership style.","2019","2020-05-20 00:54:14","2020-05-20 00:54:14","","","","19","16","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph16193649; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002708547","adult; female; human; human experiment; male; article; soccer player; adolescent; questionnaire; perception; leadership; satisfaction; climate; Spaniard","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

He was previously healthy, physically fit and did not take any medications. Observed mechanism of injury involved high energy cervical hyperextension while attempting to make a tackle, ultimately being driven backwards, striking his head posteriorly upon contact with the ground. The patient denied loss of consciousness, but reported a transient inability to move both his upper and lower extremities for approximately 10 seconds. By the time the training staff and team physician arrived, gross motor symptoms had resolved and he was able to walk off the field under his own power. He was taken to the Emergency Department immediately by EMS. Physical Exam: In the ED, his vital signs were within normal limits. He still did not have neck pain and was able to fully range his neck. His Spurling's test was negative in the ED. He continued to have the painful paresthesias, but they were slightly improved. Deltoid motor strength was 4/5 bilaterally and the remaining motor exam was 5/5 in all remaining dermatomes. Differential Diagnosis: Transient Neuropraxia Spinal hemorrhage Disc Prolapse Acute transverse myelitis Neoplasm or space occupying lesion Test Results: A non-contrast cervical CT was performed and was read as slight cervical curve reversal without identification of fracture or other acute process. He continued to have post traumatic paresthesias, so a cervical MRI was performed. The MRI showed a congenital spinal stenosis with an 8.8 mm AP diameter without other acute process. Final Diagnosis: He was diagnosed with cervical cord neuro-praxia (CCN) as a result of spinal canal stenosis. Discussion: Literature regarding return the optimal treatment of patients with CCN is of low quality. Based on current expert opinion, patients with CCN and the absence of radiographic stenosis, may return to participation as a strong recommendation. Patients with an episode of CCN and the presence of significant cervical stenosis, whether by Torg ratio or MSCSAC, should not return to participation in sports with potential for high energy hyper extension or hyperflexion injuries due to increased risk of significant spinal cord injury. Outcome: The patient followed up with a neurosurgeon as well as a sports medicine physician, who both recommended retirement from all contact sports. His paresthesias were gone after 2 days and he was symptom free at follow up. Follow-up: Patients with an episode of CCN and the presence of significant cervical stenosis, whether by Torg ratio or MSCSAC, should not return to participation in sports with potential for high energy hyper extension or hyperflexion injuries due to increased risk of significant spinal cord injury.","2019","2020-05-20 00:54:18","2020-05-20 00:54:18","","e37","","2","29","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/JSM.0000000000000728; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629860479","sports medicine; adult; conference abstract; female; football player; human; male; lower limb; case report; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; unconsciousness; clinical article; spinal cord injury; young adult; follow up; high school; outcome assessment; fracture; physical examination; hypesthesia; paresthesia; bleeding; differential diagnosis; emergency ward; neck pain; weakness; contact sport; congenital disorder; quadriplegia; deltoid muscle; retirement; vital sign; intervertebral disk hernia; cervical spinal cord; dermatome; myelitis; neoplasm; neurosurgeon; vertebral canal stenosis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this study was to analyse all elements of transitions to attack in elite football. The influence of turnover zone, turnover type and 'on the ball' player actions upon scoring goals and creating scoring opportunities (S.O.'s) were examined. A total of 3,077 transitions from all 29 games of the 2014-15 Champion's League knockout stages were coded. Multidimensional qualitative data using 11 ordered categorical variables were obtained to characterise each transition. Data were analysed using chi-square analysis. Winning turnovers in offensive areas increased the chance of scoring a goal and creating a S.O. (p < .001). Nearly half of all turnovers in the offensive zone, 49.45% (n=45) resulted in a S.O., and 7.69% (n=7) lead to goals. The tackle was the most productive way to turnover the ball (p < .05). Teams created significantly more S.O.s and scored more goals when the first and second actions after the turnover were forward (p < .05); successful dribbles, runs with the ball and long passes were the optimal player actions. Further analysis revealed that successful teams (top 4) created more S.O.'s from the defensive, defensive midfield and offensive midfield but not the offensive zone (p < .01). Finally teams created more S.O.s from turnovers in the offensive half, but not the defensive half, when losing or drawing the tie (p < .05). It was concluded that teams should press high to win turnovers and create S.O.'s, supporting the findings of Reep and Benjamin (1968). It was further concluded that the immediate player actions after winning the turnover are critical to the outcome of the transition.

This study investigated Twitter translation practice in this highly commercial industry, drawing from questionnaire and interview data from the perspective of translation providers, figures in the soccer industry, and migrant player and club tweets. The findings reveal tensions between global and local identities as soccer players, soccer clubs, and governing organizations manage identity performance and economic potential across language barriers on social media.

Initially he suffered an anterior blow injury to his proximal tibial resulting in a hyperextension injury and was unable to finish the game. Pain was sharp and worsening, waxing and waning, 7/10 pain. No radiation or paresthesia. He denies any prior knee injury or pain. No significant alleviating factors noted. Athletic trainer recommended clinic follow up due to extension deficit and effusion at time of injury; however, patient and family did not present despite multiple attempts of contact. Patient presented 4 days later backat football practice with inability to extend knee as well as progressive effusion and soft tissue edema with an antalgic gait and was re-referred to clinic. Physical Exam: Left Knee: soft tissue swelling and effusion noted. Range of Motion: active and passive 15 degrees with extension, 100 degrees with flexion. Pain to palpation over the distal femur. Depression palpated and visualized along the distal femur. Significant guarding limiting exam. Strength is 51 with dorsiflexion and plantarflexion as well as 41 with knee extension and flexion due to pain. Sensation is intact to light touch throughout the lower extremity. 21 dorsalis pedis pulse and posterior tibial pulse. No cyanosis or mottling of the foot. No gross laxity with anterior-posterior drawer at 90 degrees seated or with varus or valgus stress at 30 degrees. Rest of knee maneuvers deferred due to pain. Differential Diagnosis: Bucket handle meniscus tear Patellar fracture Quadriceps tendon rupture Tibial plateau fracture Physis injury Test Results: X-ray of knee: left distal femoral Salter-Harris type II fracture with posterior displacement of distal femoral physis. Final Diagnosis: Posteriorly displaced Salter Harris type II fracture of the distal femoral physis. Discussion: Presentation of traumatic distal femoral pain has a varied differential. When combined with an athlete with open physis the differential also must include injury to these structures. Although rare, our case is an illustration of sequalae from a forced traumatic hyperextension injury to the knee. Evident effusion with extension deficit reinforced the importance of radiographic evaluation. Given the findings of fracture as well as displacement, reduction was required for our patient. Reduced physis injuries also carry a recommendation of fixation. Outcome: He was placed in a locked TROM at angle for comfort and made non-weight bearing. He was referred to the ER and underwent subsequent closed reduction of displaced Salter Harris II distal femur fracture. Two smooth percutaneous Steinmann pins were placed in cross fashion for fixation. He was placed in a long leg cast and made non-weightbearing for 6 weeks. Follow-up: Slow progression of weight bearing status based on post-surgical response. He will need continued monitoring with emphasis at the 6 month mark for leg length discrepancy. Return to play with non-displaced fracture can be around 12 to 14 weeks. However, with displaced fracture with interven-tional fixation return to play is indeterminant.","2019","2020-05-20 00:54:39","2020-05-20 00:54:39","","e21","","2","29","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/JSM.0000000000000728; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629860209","conference abstract; football player; human; male; case report; clinical article; follow up; child; school child; range of motion; knee meniscus rupture; clinical assessment; soft tissue; paresthesia; sensation; touch; stress; knee pain; foot; differential diagnosis; gait; X ray; weight bearing; athletic trainer; edema; palpation; leg length inequality; comfort; middle school; patella fracture; quadriceps tendon rupture; cyanosis; long leg cast; distal femur; closed reduction (procedure); tibial plateau fracture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Equipment and methods: A retrospective study of the 2016/2017 and 2017/2018 seasons was conducted including 17 League 1 and 2 League clubs. All of the male players participating in the first team matches were included. The injuries > 3 days of sporting shutdown have been taken into account. All trauma has been accounted for by the ASKAMON medical tracking software database used by each club's medical staffs. We only had the final and overall data of the reported injuries. For hourly volumes, training hours were collected declaratively by all the clubs included. The hours of games were collected thanks to the databases of the Professional Football League (LFP) and the databases available on the Internet. Results: At the LFP level, 831 injuries were recorded for 262,052 hours of activities. There were 11.2 times more risk of injury in competition than training (17.2/1000 h vs. 1.53/1000 h). The main location was at the thigh level (n = 308) with an injury on 2 of muscular origin mainly to the hamstrings and stage 3 to the classification of Durey and Rodineau. A player was risking an average of 0.9 muscle injury > 3 days of sporting downtime over a season. Severe injuries (28 days off) were for one injury in 3 (n = 255). Discussion: This is the second study in France, with the aim of determining the incidence and characteristics of the injuries of the adult football players. We couldn't perform analyses of variances due to the lack of data from club trauma by club. It was only an average. Furthermore, our results only considered injuries > 3 days. However, we could observe similarities with data from other European and international championships. Conclusion: The competition leads to more trauma and injuries with risk of severity more increased compared to the training. The main nature of the injury remains muscular with a preferred location at thigh level and especially at the hamstrings. The use of a common medical software for all clubs is an important step forward for the monitoring of the professional football in France. The rigorous use of this software, with technical adaptations to be made, will eventually get a real medical identity of the French professional football player. The traumatic risk in professional football is high. The objective was to determine the risk and the nature of the occurrence of trauma injuries as well as the incidence of trauma in competition and training.","2019","2020-05-20 00:54:42","2020-05-20 00:54:42","","75-85","","2","36","","","","","","","","","","English French","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jts.2019.03.002; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2001827128","football player; human; article; soccer player; sport injury; hamstring muscle; risk assessment; retrospective study; medical staff; Internet; muscle injury; injury severity; France","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The inclusion of Australian soccer teams into the Asian Champions league has seen additional stress placed on soccer players' training and competition schedules. For management staff, the complexity of organizing training and travel schedules during domestic competition and the Asian Champions league is challenging. DESIGN: Case study. PARTICIPANTS: Seven male professional soccer players (mean ± SD: age 25.2 ± 3.2 years, height 182.8 ± 5.2 cm, body mass 84.6 ± 7.4 kg). MEASUREMENTS: This study examined the sleep and fatigue levels of Australian soccer players during an intensive home and away travel schedule during the Asian Champions league. Seven male professional soccer players' (mean ± SD: age 25.2 ± 3.2 years, height 182.8 ± 5.2 cm, body mass 84.6 ± 7.4 kg) sleep/wake behavior was assessed using sleep diaries and wrist activity monitors for 19 days, including 9 days before, 5 days during, and 4 days after a home and away group stage match of the Asian Champions league. Analyses examined differences in sleep/wake behavior and fatigue levels between day type (training day, rest day, pregame, and postgame) and between sleep location (Adelaide, during flight, and Hiroshima). RESULTS: Sleep/wake behavior and fatigue levels were poorest the night immediately after games compared to the night before games, training days, and rest days. Soccer players' sleep/wake behaviors were disrupted during flights such that they obtained 3.6 hours less sleep during flights compared to sleep in Adelaide (7.0 ± 1.6 hours) and Hiroshima (7.0 ± 2.1 hours). CONCLUSION: The sleep/wake behaviors of professional soccer players are compromised when they are required to travel and compete in multiple matches within a short period of time.","2019","2020-05-20 00:54:45","2020-05-20 00:54:45","","141-147","","2","5","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sleh.2018.10.013; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L627111965","adult; human; male; soccer; statistics and numerical data; athlete; young adult; psychology; fatigue; competitive behavior; Australia; sleep; time factor; travel; international cooperation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

HYPOTHESIS:: Soccer-related fractures will have decreased over the past 7 years. STUDY DESIGN:: Descriptive epidemiology study.Level 3. METHODS:: The National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) database was queried to identify soccer-related injuries from 2010 through 2016. The sum of the weighted values provided in the NEISS database was used to determine injury frequency and allowed us to estimate the incidence and annual trends of soccer-related fractures. The estimated annual number of hospital admissions resulting from each fracture location was calculated. Statistical analyses were performed, and a linear regression was used to analyze the annual injury trends, reported as the correlation coefficient. RESULTS:: Over the 6-year period, there were an estimated 1,590,365 soccer-related injuries. The estimated annual frequency of soccer-related injuries slightly increased from 225,910 in 2010 to 226,150 in 2016 ( P = 0.477). The most common injuries were sprains/strains (32.4%), followed by fractures (20.4%). Fractures at the wrist were the most common (18%), while upper leg fractures were the most common soccer-related fractures to be admitted to the hospital (51.6%). The annual trends of the most common soccer-related fractures demonstrated increases in shoulder ( r = 0.740; R2 = 0.547; P = 0.057) and wrist ( r = 0.308; R2 = 0.095; P = 0.502) fractures. There were no significant changes in the trends of soccer-related fractures of the lower arm ( r = 0.009; R2 = 7.3 × 10-5; P = 0.986), finger ( r = 0.679; R2 = 0.460; P = 0.094), lower leg ( r = 0.153; R2 = 0.024; P = 0.743), ankle ( r = 0.650; R2 = 0.422; P = 0.114), toe ( r = 0.417; R2 = 0.174; P = 0.353), or foot ( r = 0.485; R2 = 0.235; P = 0.270). CONCLUSION:: Despite the reported growing number of soccer players in the United States, the overall number of soccer-related injuries has remained relatively stable. Overall, 60% of reported fractures occurred in the upper extremity, with the wrist being the most common site, while lower extremity fractures were the most likely to lead to hospital admission. CLINICAL RELEVANCE:: This study offers an overview of the most common types of fractures that affect soccer players and may prove beneficial in creating preventative strategies against season-ending injuries.","2019","2020-05-20 00:54:52","2020-05-20 00:54:52","","27-31","","1","11","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1941738118798629; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L626455216","adult; female; human; male; lower limb; soccer; upper limb; injury; incidence; injuries; adolescent; young adult; child; fracture; risk factor; United States; middle aged; aged; very elderly; preschool child; hospital emergency service","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Little is known regarding the comparative characteristics of recurrent versus first-time anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries sustained during athletic events and how they are influenced by sex, sports participation level, and game-time features. Purpose: To evaluate the characteristics (sex, sports level, and game timing [ie, early vs late in the game]) of recurrent ACL injury in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and high school athletes compared with first-time ACL injury. Study Design: Descriptive epidemiology study. Methods: Athletic trainers reported ACL injury occurrences and characteristics for collegiate athletes during the 2009-2010 through 2016-2017 academic years and for high school athletes during the 2011-2012 through 2013-2014 academic years. Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs for recurrent versus first-time ACL injury. The number of ACL injuries, proportions, and ORs were calculated by sex, competition level, and time in game played. Results were also classified according to injury mechanism: noncontact, overuse, or surface contact. Results: A total of 705 ACL injuries were reported, including 644 first-time injures and 61 recurrent injuries. When restricting to noncontact ACL injuries, 416 were reported (373 first-time injuries and 43 recurrent injuries). The odds of a recurrent versus new ACL injury in NCAA student-athletes were 4.6 times that of high school student-athletes (95% CI, 1.41-15.24; P =.01). When restricting to noncontact ACL injuries, the odds of a recurrent versus new ACL injury during postseason and preseason were 4.5 and 2.8 times that during the regular season, respectively. Athletes in limited-contact and noncontact sports had greater odds of a recurrent versus new ACL injury compared with athletes playing football and other contact and collision sports. There was no significant difference in the odds of a recurrent ACL injury by sex or time in game. Conclusion: Based on the current study, the odds of recurrent ACL injuries are associated with the level of competition but not associated with sex or timing of game play. Determinants of reinjury after primary ACL reconstruction will help advance care for young injured athletes who continue to participate in competitive sports.","2019","2020-05-20 00:54:55","2020-05-20 00:54:55","","","","11","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2325967119883867; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2003752466","female; human; male; article; football; priority journal; major clinical study; sport; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; anterior cruciate ligament injury; risk factor; odds ratio; collision sport; athletic trainer; sensitivity analysis; electronic medical record system","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Accurately describing injury trends in high school sports is necessary to identify student-athletes at the greatest risk of injury and where potential injury reduction interventions should be focused. With increased reported high school concussion injuries and associated state legislative requirements, increased incidence rates are needed. The purpose of this study was to provide updated high-school football concussion incidence rates. Methods: Data Source and Study Period This study used data from the Rank One Health Injury Surveillance Database (ROH ISD). Data for the current study were analyzed across 6 calendar years (2012 through 2017) from 1,999 high schools. Data from the current study examined high school football concussion data in males ages 14 to 18. The ROH ISD consists of a convenience sample of participating schools from 2012 to 2017. Exposure and injury data represent a convenience sample of US high schools. For the current study, only data provided across all 1,999 high schools were included. All 1,999 high schools included in the current study logged practice and game participation events for each individual athlete participating in football at the respective high school and athletic exposures (AEs) are an accurate representation of rostered athletes participating in either practices or games by age and calendar year. The ROH ISD was deemed Category 4 IRB exempt. Statistical Analysis Injury counts, practice exposures, game exposures, and distributions by event type (practice or game), age, and injury mechanism were examined. Injury rates per 1,000 AEs and injury rate ratios (IRRs) were calculated by event type. Injury proportion ratios (IPRs) were used to examine differences by calendar year. Risk ratios (RRs) were calculated to compare event type by calendar year. All 95% confidence intervals (CIs) not containing 1.0 were considered statistically significant. Results: 997,308 male student-athletes participated in high school football. ATs recorded a total of 14,103 concussions in high school football from a total of 235,134 total injuries across all high school sports. High school football concussions accounted for 6% of all injuries in high school sports from 2012-2017. More concussions occurred in games (51.8%) than practices (48.2%). Decreases were found in annual injury rates for practices in high school football student-athletes from 2012 to 2016 with an increase in 2017. Decreases were found in annual injury rates for games from 2012 to 2016 with an increase in 2017. IPR decreased by year from 2012 to 2016 (with an increase in 2017. IRR and RR comparisons for games versus practices were significant from 2012 to 2017 (Table 1). Conclusion: This study marks the largest epidemiological high school football concussion incidence investigation to date. The findings from this study provide updated high school football concussion incidence rates and provide further evidence of differences in injury rates when comparing practices and games. The higher rates of concussions occurring in games relative to practices emphasize prior trends of injury risk relative to the level of competition. Overall, results highlight a decline in injury rates over time and lower rates of injury compared to prior high school football epidemiological concussion studies.

Data were obtained through YouTube videos and analysed by means of Longomatch software. The variables analysed included the number of goals scored per half (45‐min period), per 15‐min period, and per 30‐min period of extra time, goal scoring zones, goals scored by substitutes, types of goals scored, and goals scored according to the playing position. With regard to 15‐min period analysis, most goals were scored between the 76th and 90th minutes (24.7%) of the game in all five World Cup competitions. Chi‐square analyses showed no significant (p > 0.05) differences in the frequency of goal scoring patterns per 45‐min and 15‐min periods in the five World Cup tournaments. Most goals were scored from inside the goal (23.8%) and penalty (14.6%) areas. The greatest number of goals was scored by strikers (54.2%), followed by midfielders (33.3%) and defenders (2.3%). These findings provide practical implications for improving goal‐scoring performance in soccer.

Nonetheless, it is safe to assume genes play a critical role in clinical natural history. Without specific genetic determinants, clinicians must look to family history for useful information on clinically relevant inheritable traits. Identical twins offer a unique opportunity to bring these issues to light. Case Presentation: Identical twin 14-year-old boys playing tackle football for the same high school team in the same position (linebacker) presented to a sports neurology clinic for evaluation on day 2 of symptom onset. Both describe sustaining multiple hits during the game against bigger opponents without one specific standout impact. By the end of the game, they both developed headaches with light and sound sensitivity, nausea and feeling off balance. Both felt their headaches worsened with an increase in intracranial pressure (i.e. coughing, bending over or yelling). Thorough neurologic family history revealed an older brother with two prior concussions without prolonged recovery. Both neurologic examinations were completely normal other than symptom production with vestibular ocular motor testing. The twins' clinical management included taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication starting on day 2 and beginning light activity on day 3. Both were asymptomatic after day 4 and were re-evaluated in clinic on day 6 with completely normal neurological examinations. The stepwise return-to-play process was completed with their school athletic trainer. They were cleared to participate in sports without restrictions on day 7.

Twenty soccer players, 25-35 years aged, were subject to a screening to verify their posture with the SIAS measurement, carried out with the subject supine, calculating the distance between the anterior superior iliac spine and tibial malleolus. Measurements showed also differences of few millimeters between the two lower limbs despite the natural compensatory mechanism of adaptation of the postural system has determined that the quadriceps muscle hypertrophy limb longer, because of the higher load, and the resulting hypotonia limb shorter. The staff chose to use the unconventional Pilates method to propose just one sample of 10 athletes because it can be practiced both outdoors and inside the gym. Research was conducted with an observational, detection with manual and computerized method with the speed test and diversified technical tests. The athletes were divided into two groups. The first group, Control Group (CG) and the second group, Research Group (RG) participated in all the training provided by the technical staff. Only the second group, consisting of 10 athletes, was given 18 additional sessions of Pilates workout that helped improve postural control, occurred with the speed test performed with and without the ball on a slalom course of 20 meters, and the strengthening muscle, occurred with the increase in the percentage of accuracy of shots on goal. Results. The final results verified at the end vintage racing, have denoted a performance improvement with particular reference to the percentage of accuracy of shots on goal, estimated at about 2.5-3%.

The analysis of teamwork could provide the opportunity to identify tactical characteristics of team performance that are associated with winning. Ball possession data from each match in the 2009–2016 Australian Football League (AFL) seasons were analysed using SNA. Seven network measures (edge count, edge density, transitivity, average path length, degree centrality, betweenness centrality and eigenvector centrality) were derived. Significant differences (p < 0.05) were identified in the characteristics of teamwork (i.e. network measures) for each AFL team in the 2016 season. Further, the median value of all network measures was different between each AFL season (2009–2016). There were differences between teams that won and lost matches for all network measures and moderate relationships with score margin. Finally, there were weak correlations between all network measures and final ladder position. These results suggest that effective passing within a team is important and that a team should maximise the number of trios in their passing network. This work provides novel insights regarding optimal teamwork strategies in AF.

To investigate the effects of repetitive subconcussive head impacts we studied boxers following customary training (sparring) using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), decomposition electromyographic (EMG) and tests of memory. Methods: Twenty amateur boxers performed three 3-min sparring bouts. Parameters of brain function and motor control were assessed prior to sparring and again immediately, 1 h and 24 h post-sparring. Twenty control participants were assessed following mock-sparring. Results: One hour after sparring boxers showed increased corticomotor inhibition, altered motor unit recruitment strategies, and decreased memory performance relative to controls, with values returning to baseline by the 24 h follow up. Conclusion: Repetitive subconcussive head impacts associated with sparring resulted in acute and transient brain changes similar to those previously reported in soccer heading, providing convergent evidence that sport-related head impacts produce a GABAergic response. These acute changes in brain health are reminiscent of effects seen following brain injury, and suggest a potential mechanism underlying the damaging long-term effects of routine repetitive head impacts in sport.","2019","2020-05-20 00:55:34","2020-05-20 00:55:34","","","","","13","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00294; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629462850","adult; human; article; sport injury; controlled study; young adult; cognition; head injury; motor performance; boxing; nervous system parameters; electromyography; brain function; occupational exposure; maximal voluntary contraction; transcranial magnetic stimulation; body position; motor control; neurophysiological recruitment; cortical excitability; corticomotor inhibition; GABAergic system; memory test; repetitive subconcussive head impact","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

He sustained a head injury during a football game when he was tackled and hit the back of his head onto the ground. He was wearing a helmet at the time. There was no witnessed loss of consciousness. He felt dizzy and confused and quickly developed a headache following the injury. He was placed in a C-collar due to neck pain. Upon evaluation in the emergency department immediately after the injury, cervical spine radiographs were obtained and reportedly normal, so the C-collar was removed. No head imaging was performed. He was diagnosed with a concussion and discharged home. In the emergency department, his parents noted new onset drooping of his left upper eyelid. Upon presentation to our clinic 2 weeks later, he had continued headache, photophobia and left eyelid drooping. Physical Exam: The patient was awake, alert and oriented with normal cognition and regular speech. Cranial nerves II through XII were intact other than notable left-sided ptosis. He was unable to fully open the left eye. Extraocular movements were intact. Motor and sensory testing was normal in all 4 extremities. Tandem gait was intact. Romberg was negative, but he demonstrated a fine bilateral hand tremor. Rapid hand alternating movements were normal. He was tremulous with finger-to-nose testing, worse on the left. There was symptom provocation with horizontal and vertical saccades in 10 seconds. Convergence and accommodation could not be adequately tested due to the left-sided ptosis. Differential Diagnosis: Cranial nerve 3 palsy Cranial nerve 7 palsy Intracranial mass Orbital fracture Horner syndrome Test Results: The patient was evaluated by an ophthalmologist who documented a flat-appearing superior tarsus, with the left brow set lower than the right and difficulty elevating the left forehead. The provider suspected a cranial nerve 7 palsy leading to abnormal elevation of the left forehead with possible lid ptosis. An MRI of the brain without contrast was obtained, which showed largely obscured paranasal sinuses and orbits but no intracranial abnormalities. Final Diagnosis: Unilateral ptosis likely secondary to incomplete cranial nerve 7 palsy in the setting of concussion. Discussion: Cranial nerve 7 innervates the frontalis muscle, which works to lift the eyebrows. Cranial nerve 7 palsy can lead to eyelid ptosis secondary to eyebrow ptosis. It can occur after traumatic head injury, but it is most often associated with temporal bone fracture; the nerve is particularly vulnerable as it courses through the temporal bone. There was no concern for skull fracture in our patient. In the setting of acute-onset ptosis with the concern for a cranial nerve palsy, brain imaging should be obtained to rule out an intracranial mass. To our knowledge, this is the first documented case of unilateral ptosis and suspected incomplete cranial nerve 7 palsy following concussion. Outcome: Upon follow up in our clinic 2 weeks later, the patient's ptosis was resolving. If we did not see improvement of his ptosis within a month of injury, the next step would be to obtain an electromyography (EMG) of cranial nerve 7. At 20 to 30 days after onset, EMG would demonstrate the intensityof denervation ofthe nerve and could be usedto track the progress of axonal regeneration over time. Follow-up: The patient was symptom-free and the ptosis was completely resolved at follow up 1 month after the injury. He progressed through the return-to-play protocol in time for the start of basketball season. The family and patient decided he would no longer participate in football.","2019","2020-05-20 00:55:44","2020-05-20 00:55:44","","e9","","2","29","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/JSM.0000000000000728; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629860501","sports medicine; conference abstract; football player; human; male; case report; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; unconsciousness; basketball; clinical article; season; adolescent; concussion; helmet; follow up; outcome assessment; body weight; physical examination; cranial nerve; electromyography; diagnosis; differential diagnosis; gait; emergency ward; headache; neck pain; denervation; photophobia; cervical spine injury; finger; forehead; Horner syndrome; saccadic eye movement; paralysis; speech; nose; cervical spine radiography; cranial nerve paralysis; eyebrow ptosis; hand tremor; nerve fiber regeneration; ophthalmologist; orbit fracture; paranasal sinus; provocation; ptosis (eyelid); temporal bone; wakefulness","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A total of 36 young football players aged 11-12 years participated in this experiment. Of them, 18 were engaged in an experimental differentiated method, which is based on using the same exercise and methods for developing the ability to unite movements but with different load components; for players with a strong nervous system (9 children), the load was intensive, but for players with a weak nervous system (9 children) - the load was volumetric. The other 18 athletes made up the control group. After 8 months of the experiment, we observed positive changes in terms of the ability to unite movements in young football players. In the control group, these changes were not significant (P>0.05). In the experimental group studied according to a special method, the indicators changed considerably. The performance of football players with a strong nervous system improved from 6.4±0.2 s to 5.7±0.1 s (P<0.05), and for football players with a weak nervous system from 6.2±0.2 s to 5.6±0.2 s (P<0.05). The study proved the effectiveness of the use of the typological properties of the nervous system as a differentiated method for developing the ability to unite movements in young football players.

Even worse, some coaches encourage athletes to conceal symptoms. If athletes and coaches knew that performance after a concussion drops significantly which may hurt the team, athletes may be more prone to report concussion symptoms. Methods: This is a case series of 3 NCAA Division I football players who did not report their concussions until a later time. The play in which the concussion occurred was identified via video review then the players' performance grades, as scored by their position coaches, were recorded both before and after the concussion. Grades from other games were obtained for further comparison. Results: Three injuries were identified and reviewed. The player in the first case had a pre-injury performance score of 76/100 with a post-injury score of 47/100. This was an absolute drop of 29 points for a relative decrease in his in-game performance by 38%. His grades for other games that year averaged 75/100 with a range of 63 to 82. The player in the second case had a pre-injury score of 100/100 with a post-injury score of 60/100. This was an absolute drop of 40 points or a 40% relative decrease in his in-game performance. His grades for other games rarely dropped below 90. The player in the third case had a pre-injury score of 67/100 and post-injury score of 43/100 for an absolute drop of 24 points or a 36% relative decrease in his in-game performance. In his one other game with significant playing time that year, he scored a 77/100. Conclusions: In this case series, we report 3 college football players who suffered concussions but did not immediately disclose their symptoms. As expected, each had a marked decrease in their performance grades after their concussion with a relative decrease of 36%, 38% and 40%, respectively, from their pre-injury grades. Significance: If the performance effect of a concussion can be quantified, athletes and coaches may change their mindset that a concussion can be ""played through."" This case series should serve as a first step in quantifying concussion effects on performance.","2019","2020-05-20 00:56:02","2020-05-20 00:56:02","","132","","2","29","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/JSM.0000000000000724; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629860430","conference abstract; football player; human; male; case report; clinical article; concussion; case study; videorecording; quantitative analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It was the neck?","Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine","","1536-3724","10.1097/JSM.0000000000000728","","History: A 22-year-old male college football player presented to the ED with neck pain after taking a hit to the left shoulder and chest at a football game 2 weeks before presentation. At the game, he presented to the athletic trainer and physician with hemoptysis. No neck pain was reported. Plain films were negative for rib fracture or pulmonary contusion. Approximately 1 week later, he woke up with mild pain in the base of his skull that radiated to his left ear. Pain progressed over the next several days, which prevented him from returning to practice. There was pain with neck flexion and a catching sensation when extending back to neutral. Symptoms were worse in the morning and aggravatedby coughing or sneezing. He denied weakness, numbness, tingling, headache, dizziness or tinnitus. When his symptoms failed to resolve after = days-2 weeks after the initial injury - he presented to ED. Physical Exam: General: Alert and oriented with no acute distress. MSK: Decreased range of motion of cervical spine with flexion, extension, lateral rotation and side bend. Neuro: Cranial Nerves II-XII intact. Sensation to light touch intact in bilateral upper and lower extremities. 5/5 strength in bilateral deltoids, biceps, triceps. 5/5 strength with bilateral wrist flexion, wrist extension and gripping. 5/5 strength with bilateral hip flexion, knee extension, ankle dorsiflexion and plantar flexion. 21 reflexes in bilateral biceps and brachior-adialis. 11 reflexes in bilateral patellar tendons. Coordination intact with finger-to-nose testing. Differential Diagnosis: Cervical disc herniation Cervical spinal cord compression Atlantoaxial ligamentous injury Cervical vertebral body fracture Cervical facet displacement Test Results: CT C-Spine: Subluxation of C1 in relation to C2, atlantodental interval (ADI) 4.5 mm (wide), anterior positioning of posterior C1 arch narrows canal at C1. High density material in L. ventral epidural space posterior to C2 vertebral body. MRI C-Spine: Injury to the R. alar, transverse and posterior interspinous ligaments at C1-C2. Large L. paracentral disc herniation at C2-C3 with associated cord impingement and flattening. DynamicXR C-Spine: ADI 4mm in flexion, 2 mm in extension. Final Diagnosis: (1) Ligamentous injury involving right alar ligament, transverse ligament and posterior interspinous ligament at C1-C2. (2) Left disc extrusion at C2-C3. Discussion: The craniocervical junction (CCJ) is stabilized by several ligaments, the strongest ofwhich include the transverse and alar ligaments. Injury to these ligaments can result in CCJ instability. The athlete also sustained a C2-C3 disc extrusion, causing cord impingement. Herniation at this level is rare, especially in young patients. High c-spine instability and herniation can result in paralysis and cardiorespiratory compromise, so prompt diagnosis is key. CT and dynamic XR can assess for C1-C2 stability. MRI can evaluate for spinal cord pathology. Immediate c-spine immobilization is imperative. The degree of stability and cord injury determine whether management is surgical or conservative. Outcome: The patient was admitted to observation for neurosurgical evaluation after initial CT and MRI were concerning for possible atlantoaxial instability. However, flexion and extension plain films ruled out gross instability. Therefore, he was treated non-operatively and placed in a cervical collar, which was to be worn at all times. Follow-up: The patient returned for follow-up neurosurgical evaluation 2 weeks after being placed in the collar. He reported complete resolution of neck pain and continued to deny any neurologic symptoms. The follow up plain films showed loss of normal lordosis; however, no further C1-C2 subluxation was noted on neutral lateral x-ray. Conservative management with cervical collar was continued on discharge.","2019","2020-05-20 00:56:05","2020-05-20 00:56:05","","e31-e32","","2","29","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/JSM.0000000000000728; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629860380","adult; conference abstract; female; football player; human; male; rib fracture; case report; hip; knee; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; biceps brachii muscle; clinical article; thorax; young adult; follow up; patellar ligament; outcome assessment; ankle; range of motion; rotation; physician; physical examination; remission; dizziness; wrist; cranial nerve; hypesthesia; sensation; touch; diagnosis; differential diagnosis; X ray; headache; neck pain; weakness; conservative treatment; athletic trainer; cervical disk hernia; compression; ligament injury; lordosis; deltoid muscle; subluxation; finger; cervical collar; triceps brachii muscle; paralysis; distress syndrome; vertebra body; nose; cervical spinal cord; coughing; epidural space; hemoptysis; immobilization; lung contusion; skull; sneezing; spinal cord disease; tinnitus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The fact that this training method resembles a football match is attractive for players and coaches alike. The latter often search for the shortest path to high performance in the game, and small-sided games enable them to achieve this during the preparation period, when the desired intensity can be achieved through play, or during the competitive season when the intention is to restore physical fitness and determine tactical principles in the game. In small-sided games the space is limited and the number of players lower, along with other limitations and rules. The most important task of the coach is to come closer to the set objectives as much as possible with proper game organisation. They must also recognise when this type of training is not suitable. The contribution presents the influences on the conditioning, technical and tactical preparations of football players. Moreover, it identifies the effects of individual limitations and the advantages of small-sided games compared to matches or other training methods.

The aim of the study was to characterise the incidence and duration of upper respiratory illness in school boy (three tiers), amateur, and professional rugby players to assess the typical illness rates across different levels. Participants were asked to complete a questionnaire twice a week for the duration of the active playing season investigating level of activity, well-being, and respiratory-related symptoms. Upper respiratory illness incidence per 1000 non-sick days (± SD) for the three tiers of school boy (Under 14 s, n = 9; 2nd XV, n = 15; 1st XV, n = 24), amateur (n = 18), and professional (n = 24) teams was 11.1 ± 9.7, 11.0 ± 17.8, 22.4 ± 30.9, 12.2 ± 21.8, and 12.4 ± 16.8, respectively. In addition, the duration of illness was 62.3 ± 116.1, 59.6 ± 183.2, 552.1 ± 1138.8, 64.3 ± 173.9, and 32.6 ± 59.7 days per 1000 non-sick days, respectively. This is the first study reporting the respiratory illness rates in different levels of rugby. Overall, the highest incidence observed was in the top echelon of school boy rugby, and this study provides a platform for further robust observational and interventional investigation at this level and others.

"EAJJ39BN","journalArticle","2019","Velema, Thijs A.","Upward and downward job mobility and player market values in contemporary European professional football","Sport Management Review (Elsevier Science)","","14413523","","","Highlights • Player market values in professional football are thought to reflect prior performance and human capital. • However, controlling for prior performance and human capital, job moves shape market values. • Upward moves shift player market values up, downward moves push market values down. • Each additional upward job move has a cumulative positive effect on market values. • The negative effect of downward moves reduces when players are more important for their new team. Abstract One question facing professional football (soccer) players in today's highly mobile football labor market is how to move between teams and develop boundaryless careers that positively signal their qualities, skills, and value to the market. The author departs from previous researchers, who have conceptualized market values as a function of performance and human capital factors at one point in time. Instead, the author argues that market observers face imperfect information when estimating the value of players, which they overcome by using job mobility as a signal for the qualities, skills, and playing potential of footballers. Analyzing a unique longitudinal dataset of 1670 professional player careers with fixed effects panel regressions, results indicate that upward mobility is a positive signal shifting observers' estimations of player market values up and downward mobility is a negative signal pushing market values down. Each extra move up leads to an additional increase in market values and the negative impact of downward mobility decreases when players take up more important roles in their new team. The impact of mobility on player market values is thus contingent on broader career patterns and the context in which job mobility takes place.

Working on neuromuscular activity, offers the possibility of intervention on postural control. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the possibility of interacting with the human body system through the spinal reflex pathway, starting from the stimulation of cutaneous receptors. METHODS: Twenty soccer players were recruited: all were male aged 25.5±10.6 years. Patients were divided using a single-blind criterion into two groups, each containing ten subjects. The experimental group was treated with 2 pre-set programs 4 times a week with an adaptive neuro-stimulation (ANS) able to interact with cutaneous receptors through an ENF Physio® device with a range of electrical frequency of about 15-350 Hz; the placebo-controlled group received the treatment with the device switched off. Patients performed a myometric evaluation with the MyotonPRO® system and a postural one with the Rarog software at T0 before the treatment and at T1 after the four-week treatment. RESULTS: After our intervention, we identified an improvement in muscular tone, in particular in the hamstring muscles (17.69%, right P<0.01 / left P<0.05) and a rebalancing of the principal bone points in the postural system (shoulder 71%, P<0.05, hips 65.6%, P=0.056, sagittal AP and frontal LL center of gravity, respectively 40%, P<0.05 and 52.7%, P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, we could hypothesize the usefulness of an ANS to act on these parameters.

Quantification of centre of pressure (COP) movement is the most common focus of instrumented assessment. Frequency-domain COP analyses have focused primarily on summary measures or pre-defined frequency bands but continuous analysis may provide novel and complementary insight into pathological control mechanisms. Our aims were (i) to compare post-SRC COP trajectory changes identified using clinician scores (Modified Balance Error Scoring System (M-BESS)), time-domain COP variables and continuous frequency spectral comparison; and (ii) to characterise frequency spectra changes. Male rugby players aged 15–19 years (n = 135) completed a pre-season baseline assessment comprising vision-obscured double-leg, single-leg and tandem stances on a force platform. Participants diagnosed with SRC during the season (n = 15) underwent repeat testing (median 4 days post-SRC; IQR 2.5–6.5). Baseline and post-SRC COP trajectories were compared using common time-domain COP variables, M-BESS scores and continuous frequency spectra. Post-SRC changes were identified using all three approaches. Spectral analysis revealed the largest effect size (Cliff's delta 0.39) and was the only method to identify differences in all three stances and in double-leg stance. All post-SRC increases in spectral content were in the anteroposterior direction; all decreases were in the mediolateral direction. Changes were localised to higher frequencies (1.7–8 Hz) except for double-leg stance anteroposterior direction, for which increases were observed throughout the analysed range. Our findings suggest that this method of spectral comparison may provide a more responsive and meaningful measure of postural stability changes after SRC than other commonly-used variables.","2019","2020-05-20 00:56:33","2020-05-20 00:56:33","","","","","97","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiomech.2019.109400; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2003454128","adult; human; article; rugby; controlled study; major clinical study; season; scoring system; adolescent; concussion; leg; effect size; intermethod comparison; vision; standing; Fourier transform; spectroscopy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite the importance given to performance skills no specific nutritional guideline is provided to support the performance required. This study was aimed to investigate soccer field and assistant referees knowledge and consumption of dietary supplements. Seventy-one European referees participated to this survey by filling a short and quick anonymous questionnaire designed to collect information about their refereeing category, educational level, frequency of supplement consumption, type of supplement consumed. Moreover, a sub-group of 20 participants wore a training watch to record energy expenditure, distance, and heart rate during training sessions and matches. Our data show that referees frequently consume supplements especially those refereeing in lower categories, moreover they often follow a friend's suggestion when deciding to take a supplement instead of trusting a professional prescription. According to our survey, national and international soccer federations should care more about their referee nutritional education.

An “early unloading” (minute 0) and “late unloading” (minute 28) T2-sequence was included in the set of images. Quantitative T2-analysis was performed in the femorotibial joint cartilage in 4 slices with each 10 regions of interest (ROIs). Statistical evaluation, using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, was primarily performed to compare the T2 values of the “early unloading” and “late unloading.” Results: When comparing “early unloading” with “late unloading,” our findings showed a significant increase of T2-relaxation times in the weightbearing femoral cartilage of the medial (P < 0.001) and lateral (P < 0.001) compartment of the knee and in the tibial cartilage of the medial compartment (P < 0.001). Conclusion: In this study, alterations of the cartilage were found with a maximum in the medial condyle where the biomechanical load of the knee joint is highest, as well as where most of the chronic cartilage lesions occur. To avoid chronic damage, special focus should be laid on this region.","2019","2020-05-20 00:56:49","2020-05-20 00:56:49","","288-298","","3","10","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1947603518756986; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L620740980","adult; human; male; article; soccer player; knee; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; major clinical study; prospective study; adolescent; body mass; resistance training; human tissue; quantitative analysis; femoral condyle; image analysis; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; exploratory behavior; stifle; articular cartilage; 3-T Magnetom-Verio; cartilage degeneration; confirmatory factor analysis; humeral condyle; relaxation time","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using small-sided games in field hockey: Can they be used to reach match intensity? J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2019-Small-sided games (SSGs) are commonly used in field hockey to replicate or overload physical and tactical competition demands; however, little evidence is available regarding if specific SSG formats achieve this. This research investigated how speed and acceleration differed between 5-minute SSG formats (2v2, 3v3, and 4v4) and also compared with competition. Elite male field hockey athletes (n = 10) participated in the SSGs with standard rules, on pitches of 30 × 20, 35 × 25, and 40 × 30 m, respectively (∼150 m per athlete excluding goal keepers). Global Positioning System devices measured speed (m·min) and acceleration (m·s). Differences between mean speed and acceleration during SSGs and 5-minute maximal mean values from competition (calculated using moving averages) were quantified using linear mixed models and described using standardized effect sizes (ES) and 90% confidence intervals. Between SSG formats, there were nonsubstantial differences for mean speed and acceleration (ES range -0.4 to 0.8). Compared with competition, mean speed was substantially lower for all SSG formats (ES range -1.4 to -1.8), whereas mean acceleration was higher (ES range 3.9-4.8). The SSG formats examined had a lower mean speed and higher mean acceleration than the maximal mean observed in competition. Therefore, these SSGs are an effective training drill for the development and overload of acceleration. However, manipulating SSG constraints to expose athletes to the maximal mean competition speed is required.","2019","2020-05-20 00:56:52","2020-05-20 00:56:52","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1519/JSC.0000000000003445; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L630061665","adult; human; article; acceleration; clinical article; competition; athlete; hockey; effect size; global positioning system; pitch; quantitative analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using the rating of perceived exertion and heart rate to quantify training intensity in female soccer players: validity and utility. J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2019-The aims of this study were as follows: (a) to analyze associations between session rating of perceived exertion (sRPE) and training impulse (TRIMP); (b) to verify whether significantly different ranges of percentage of heart rate peak (%HRpeak) would be reached in each discrete RPE category; and (c) to investigate the amount of time spent >90% of HRpeak and associated intraplayer and interplayer variability during soccer technical training sessions with similar contents and duration. This was a single-group observational study that measured the internal training load during 6 weeks of the competitive period in 17 high-level female soccer players. All training sessions started around 9 PM. and lasted on average 94 ± 5 minutes. During each training session, RPE, sRPE, TRIMP, HRex (%HRpeak), and time spent at >90% of HRpeak were assessed. A very large correlation was found between sRPE and TRIMP (r = 0.78; 95% confidence interval: [0.74-0.82]). Significant differences were observed between %HRpeak associated with each RPE value (i.e., RPE = 2 arbitrary unit [68%; 65-69% of %HRpeak]; RPE 3 [72%; 69-75%]; RPE 4 [79%; 76-82%]; RPE 5 [84; 81-87%]; χ = 73.34; df = 3; P < 0.001). Intraplayer and interplayer coefficients of variation for the time spent >90% of HRpeak (∼8% of training time, ∼7 minutes per session) during training sessions were 73 and 92%, respectively. In conclusion, it was confirmed that sRPE and TRIMP displayed good convergent validity, and different %HRpeak were observed for each discrete RPE. However, because of the high variability in the time >90% of HRpeak, careful monitoring of individual exercises should be performed to ensure the desired training stimulus for each player.","2019","2020-05-20 00:56:53","2020-05-20 00:56:53","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1519/JSC.0000000000003407; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629537920","adult; female; human; article; soccer player; exercise; heart rate; observational study; controlled study; convergent validity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methodology: Over a 1-year period in the 2016/17 rugby season, blood samples were collected from 15 players pre- and post season, with additional samples collected after confirmed concussion (n = 7). Blood samples were taken from a control group of rowers (n = 15) preand post-training to act as controls. Results: In rugby players with confirmed concussion, there was no significant difference in S100B concentration across the season (Z = 0.944 p = 0.345) or between preseason and immediately postconcussion. However, a significant increase was observed between samples taken post- concussion and end of season (Z=-2.201 p = 0.028). No difference was detected between pre- and postseason in players with diagnosed concussions when compared with those without. For BDNF, no significant differences were observed across season or following concussion. Circulating S100B concentration was comparable between sports at baseline or pretraining, while circulating BDNF was significantly increased in rugby players when compared with rowers at the same timepoint (v2(2) = 11.895, p < 0.001). Of 7 confirmed concussions only 2 were above the mTBI diagnostic threshold of >0.1 μg/L S100B. Conclusion: Following a concussion, circulating S100B concentration was elevated in comparison to end of season values in rugby players, but diagnostic thresholds for mTBI were not reached in the majority of concussive events. Whilst there was no significant difference between circulating S100B in rugby players and rowers at baseline/preseason, circulating BDNF was shown to be significantly higher in rugby players, which may be due to the effect of exercise.","2019","2020-05-20 00:56:55","2020-05-20 00:56:55","","A30","","13","36","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/neu.2019.29100.abstracts; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628868212","conference abstract; human; rugby; clinical article; exercise intensity; controlled study; season; concussion; human tissue; traumatic brain injury; protein S100B; biological marker; endogenous compound; diagnosis; brain derived neurotrophic factor","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A total of 207 observations of 38 official matches from Liga 1, 2, 3™ (2nd Spanish Division, season 2017/18) were included in the study (88 defenders, 84 midfielders, and 35 attackers of the same team). Total distance (TD, m) distance in zone 4 (DZ4) at a speed of 14-21 km/h, distance in zone 5 (DZ5) at a speed of 21-24 km/h (DZ5), distance in zone 6 (DZ6) at a speed of ≥24 km/h, maximum speed (km/h), and number of sprints (actions above 24 km/h) were registered with the Apex® GPS system (STATSports™, Newry, N. Ireland) and Mediacoach® semi-automatic tracking system (LaLiga™, Madrid, Spain). The level of agreement between variables estimated by the two systems was analyzed. Bias was also calculated by deducting the GPS estimated value from the video estimated value, and then dividing the difference score by the GPS estimated value. All variables showed high ICC values (>0.75) and very large correlations (r > 0.70). However the video-based performance analysis system overestimated the results obtained in the different speed zones (DZ5: +16.59 ± 62.29 m; LOA95%: -105.49 to 138.68; DZ6: +93.26 ± 67.76 m; LOA95%: -39.55 to 226.07), the number of sprints (+2.27 ± 2.94; LOA95%: -3.49 to 8.02), and the maximum speed (+0.32 ± 1.25 km/h; LOA95%: -2.13 to 2.77). The maximum bias was found in DZ6 (47%). This demonstrates that Mediacoach® is as accurate as a GPS system to obtain objective data in real time, adapted to physical and movement demands of elite football, especially for total distance and distances traveled at medium speeds.","2019","2020-05-20 00:57:00","2020-05-20 00:57:00","","","","19","19","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629405453; http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s19194113","football player; human; article; season; motion; velocity; videorecording; Spain; Ireland","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design: Cross-sectional. Methods: Twenty male WR athletes with impaired arm strength and thirty able-bodied (AB) participants (15 male, 15 female) performed four isometric strength tests. Each test required three 5-s efforts and examined maximal isometric force for flexion and extension around the shoulder and elbow joint. Test validity was established by comparing differences (Cohen's effect sizes [d]) in strength between WR athletes and AB participants. Differences were also explored between male and female AB participants. Twenty AB participants returned for a second visit to establish the test-retest reliability of the test battery. Results: Significantly lower force values were observed for all isometric strength measures in WR athletes compared to AB participants (p ≤ 0.0005; d ≥ 2.14). Female AB participants also produced significantly less force than male AB participants for all joint actions (p ≤ 0.0005; d ≥ 1.93). No significant differences were identified between trials for any measure of strength, with acceptable levels of test-retest reliability reported (ICCs ≥ 0.97, SEM ≤ 19.3 N and CV ≤ 8.4%). Conclusions: The current results demonstrated the validity of a battery of isometric strength tests, suggesting they can be used to reliably infer strength impairment in WR athletes, which is a pre-requisite when working towards evidence-based classification in Paralympic sport.","2019","2020-05-20 00:57:04","2020-05-20 00:57:04","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsams.2019.12.022; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2004391700","adult; female; human; human experiment; male; article; rugby; clinical article; controlled study; athlete; validity; effect size; shoulder; elbow; test retest reliability; wheelchair","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate a new, functional on-field program for the rehabilitation and readaptation of soccer players after a hamstring strain injury through a panel of experts; and determine the usefulness of the program through its application in professional soccer players. DESIGN: A 13-item program was developed, which was validated by a panel of experts and later applied to professional soccer players. SETTING: Soccer training ground. PARTICIPANTS: Fifteen strength and conditioning and rehabilitation fitness coaches with a professional experience of 15.40 (1.57) years in elite clubs and national teams in Europe validated the program. The program was later applied to 19 professional soccer players of the Spanish First Division (La Liga). INTERVENTIONS: Once a player sustained a clinically diagnosed injury, the player would first be subject to mobilization and strengthening exercises in the gym after undergoing treatment by percutaneous needle electrolysis. The player would then complete an on-field readaptation program consisting of 13 drills arranged in a progressive manner in terms of complexity. The drills integrated various aspects of repeated sprint abilities, retraining and reeducation of biomechanical patterns, and neuromuscular control of the core and lower limbs. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Aiken's V for each item of the program and number of days taken by the players to return to play. RESULTS: The experts evaluated all items of the program very highly, as seen from Aiken's V values between 0.78 and 0.98 (0.63-0.99) for all drills, while the return to play was in 22.42 (2.32) days. CONCLUSION: This program has the potential to help a player suffering from a hamstring strain injury to adapt to real-match conditions in the readaptation phase through the application of sports-specific drills that were very similar to the different injury mechanisms.","2019","2020-05-20 00:57:06","2020-05-20 00:57:06","","","","6","28","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1123/jsr.2018-0203; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629200634","adult; human; soccer; sport injury; hamstring muscle; injury; prospective study; young adult; longitudinal study; leg injury; program evaluation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

High training loads are required in order to develop these characteristics and help bridge the gap between elite junior and elite senior (AFL) competitions. It is important to quantify player training loads and wellness (response to these loads) in order to reduce the risk of potential adverse effects. Methods: Players from nine of the twelve under-18 state league clubs (n = 562, age: 17.7 ± 0.3, range 16-18 years; height: 188.4 ± 7.1, range 176.7–202.7 cm) were invited to use an online monitoring tool to report their training and match loads as well as wellness at 3 time points across the week. Monotony was calculated as daily mean/standard deviation, and strain as load x monotony. Wellness was reported according to a five item scale rated from 1 to 5 at 3 time-points across the week. A Generalised Estimating Equation (GEE) model was carried out to assess for associations between load variables and wellness. Of specific interest was the association between within week load measures (monotony and strain) and individual player wellness factors. Results: The mean (SD) for monotony across the week was 2.13 (1.22), and 4257.8 (3154.7) for strain. Overall player wellness was the lowest 1-day and 6-days post match, mostly due to poor sleep quality, soreness and fatigue the day after competition. Player mood improved consistently over the three time points (1-day, 3-days, 6-days post-match) across the week. Player monotony was associated with changes in mood (b = 0.11, 95 % CI–0.18 to–0.05) and player soreness (b = –0.06, 95 % CI–0.11 to–0.01) across the week. Specifically, monotony was associated with player mood the day immediately post-match (b = –0.07, 95 % CI–0.13 to–0.01). Discussion: It is important to be able to quantify weekly training and match loads and to be able to identify how they are coping and responding with these loads. This study identifies key associations between load across the week (monotony) and wellness variables (player mood and soreness). By quantifying loads and the associations with wellness, coaches can further optimise the physical preparation of their elite junior players, ultimately to help improve performance and reduce the risk of adverse events.","2019","2020-05-20 00:57:16","2020-05-20 00:57:16","","S64","","","22","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsams.2019.08.266; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002914880","adult; conference abstract; human; football; controlled study; major clinical study; season; competition; adolescent; risk assessment; fatigue; mood; skill; quantitative analysis; sleep quality; online monitoring","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Autocorrelation function, correlation analysis and generalised linear model were used to examine the relationships between the variation of match variables and teams' match performance. Results showed that the qualified teams demonstrated a more stable match performance on the variables related to goal scoring, attacking and passing, while the non-qualified teams displayed a more stable match performance on the variables related to defending. The coefficients of variation (CV) of all the variables related to goal scoring and the variables related to attacking and passing showed negative relationships with the teams' match performance, while the CVs of the variables related to defending showed positive relationships with the teams' match performance. Findings of this study can provide useful information about the fluctuation of match variables, contributing to the development of specific training interventions to enhance teams' performance in key indicators.

Twenty-three professional male soccer players (24.632.84 years old; 180.946.49 cm; 77.196.46 kg; 52.995.01 VO2max) participated in the study. Total distance, running distance, sprinting distance, number of sprints, and acceleration sum were quantified per minute to compare the different games. Running distance in full match was greater than in 5vs5+GK (d = 2.303, moderate effect), 6vs6+GK (d = 1.719, moderate effect) and 9vs9+GK (d = 1.084, minimum effect) sided games. Greater values for sprinting distance were found in the full match compared to 5vs5+GK (d = 3.673, strong effect), 6vs6+GK (d = 2.606, moderate effect) and 9vs9+GK (d = 1.903, moderate effect) sided games. However, the load was greater in the 5vs5+GK game compared to the 6vs6+GK (d = 1.323, moderate effect) and 9vs9+GK (d = 1.030, minimum effect) games and the full match (d = 1.478, moderate effect). This study revealed that medium-sided games are not appropriate for simulating the sprinting conditions of official full matches. However, medium-sided games are more intense than full matches in that accelerations are made more often in medium-sided games.

Large positive correlations were found between sum of training load and extension peak torque in the right lower limb (r = 0.57, 90%CI[0.15;0.82]) and the ratio agonist/antagonist in the right lower limb (r = 0.51, [0.06;0.78]). It was observed that loading measures fluctuated across the period of the study and that the load was meaningfully associated with changes in the fitness status of players.

Methods: Doppler-derived recordings of instantaneous velocity and acceleration were collected (10 Hz GPS) from 27 international female football players during 52 international matches between 2012 and 2015. Data were examined with k-means, Gaussian mixture model (GMM), and Spectral Clustering methods to identify four velocity zones, in each completed half of match-play (277 observations). Spectral Clustering was also performed with 4 different smoothing parameters ( values of 0, 0.001, 0.01, and 0.1). Linear-mixed modelling was used to determine generic squad thresholds, accounting for the within-subject variation. Results: k-means and GMM generated low transition velocities, which had limited logical validity and deemed not fit for purpose. Spectral Clustering with a value of 0.1 derived thresholds that differed from the various methods adopted in existing literature and industry practice, yet providing a rigorous, acceptable, and feasible determination of velocity thresholds. Conclusion: Velocities of 3.46 (12.5 km h−1), 5.29 (19.0 km h−1), and 6.26 m s−1 (22.5 km h−1) are recommended as entry criteria into high, very-high velocity, and sprinting locomotor categories, respectively, for the purpose of external load assessments in elite women's football.

Wearable instrumented technology was used to observe and characterize the level of exposure to head impacts during game play. Purpose: To verify the impacts recorded by the x-patch™ with video analysis. Study design: Observational case series. Methods: The x-patch™ was used on eight men’s semi-professional rugby league players during the 2016 Newcastle Rugby League competition (five forwards and three backs). Game day footage was recorded by a trained videographer using a single camera located at the highest midfield location to verify the impact recorded by the x-patch™. Videographic and accelerometer data were time synchronized. Results: The x-patch™ sensors recorded a total of 779 impacts ≥ 20 g during the games, of which 732 (94.0%) were verified on video. In addition, 817 impacts were identified on video that did not record an impact on the sensors. The number of video-verified impacts ≥ 20 g, per playing hour, was 7.8 for forwards and 4.8 for backs (range = 3.9–19.0). Impacts resulting in a diagnosed concussion had much greater peak linear acceleration (M = 76.1 g, SD = 17.0) than impacts that did not result in a concussion (M = 34.2g, SD = 18.0; Cohen’s d = 2.4). Conclusions: The vast majority (94%) of impacts ≥ 20 g captured by the x-patch™ sensor were video verified in semi-professional rugby league games. The use of a secondary source of information to verify impact events recorded by wearable sensors is beneficial in clarifying game events and exposure levels.","2019","2020-05-20 00:57:29","2020-05-20 00:57:29","","","","1","5","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002877122; http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40798-019-0182-3","adult; human; male; article; rugby; acceleration; observational study; prospective study; accelerometer; videorecording; neurophysiology; head impact; biosensor; electronic sensor; health impact assessment; x-patch","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this study was to investigate vestibulo-ocular function in a cohort of adolescent rugby players with and without a history of concussion during pre-season assessment. Design: Cross-sectional cohort. Methods: 213 male adolescent (13–18 years old) rugby players were recruited from six schools in Queensland, Australia. Vestibulo-ocular assessments were conducted during the preseason and included clinical assessment of oculomotor function and the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) using the clinical and video-Head Impulse Test (HIT). Players were allocated into two groups: no history of concussion in the last 12 months (n = 165); and concussion in the last 12 months (n = 48). Results: There were no between group differences in vestibulo-ocular function for players with and without a history of concussion (p = 0.65). However, vestibulo-ocular dysfunction was reported in 69 (32.7%) of the players tested, who had either abnormal oculomotor control or VOR function. Conclusions: The high prevalence of vestibulo-ocular dysfunction in adolescent rugby players suggests that positive clinical findings post-concussion need to be interpreted carefully in the absence of baseline or pre-concussion assessments.","2019","2020-05-20 00:57:34","2020-05-20 00:57:34","","144-149","","","39","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.msksp.2018.12.007; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2001419060","adult; human; male; article; rugby; priority journal; major clinical study; adolescent; athlete; cohort analysis; concussion; young adult; cross-sectional study; Queensland; clinical assessment; school; head impulse test; eye movement control; vestibular disorder; vestibulo ocular dysfunction; vestibuloocular reflex","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Background Cognitive training programs are becoming an increasingly popular strategy for improving athletic performance. Such programs may have potential to decrease athletes' concussion risk by improving athletes' ability to avoid and appropriately react to imminent impacts in the athletic environment. Understanding what cognitive factors contribute to concussive impacts may provide insight into the most appropriate cognitive training regimens for concussion risk reduction. Design/Methods YouTube videos depicting 100 concussive impacts in athletes were identified via Google video search. Two reviewers independently classified the primary cognitive factor contributing to each impact as one of the following: useful field of view (UFOV, unanticipated/unrecognized impacts coming from outside the athlete's field of view), field dependence (FD, unanticipated/unrecognized impacts resulting from the athlete's attention being so focused on an athletic task that the pending impact was not recognized), processing speed (PS, anticipated/ recognized impacts occurring too quickly for the athlete to complete an evasive or protective maneuver), or motion perception (MP, anticipated/recognized impacts occurring with sufficient time to respond but associated with a poorly planned or implemented motor response). Descriptive statistics were calculated. Results 98 videos were reviewed to yield 100 concussive impacts. 98% of the concussed athletes were males. Concussions occurred during American football (53%), ice hockey (29%), soccer (3%), basketball (3%), as well as 9 other sports (12%). The most commonly contributing cognitive factor was MP (32%), followed by FD (30%), UFOV (23%), and PS (15%). Conclusions Multiple cognitive factors contribute to concussive impacts in athletes, with MP and FD being the most common in our sample. Cognitive training programs intending to reduce concussion risk in athletes should not focus only on one cognitive factor. Future work should also explore differences between sports and positions.","2019","2020-05-20 00:57:37","2020-05-20 00:57:37","","S12-S13","","14","93","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1212/01.wnl.0000580948.37531.56; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629665805","adult; conference abstract; human; male; football; soccer; basketball; training; concussion; attention; ice hockey; videorecording; movement perception; risk reduction; processing speed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thirty-four players (forwards: n = 19; backs: n = 15) of the Welsh rugby union male senior national team performed the WAT (10 × 50-m distance, 25-30 seconds of passive recovery) twice within 4 days. Time for each repetition was recorded, with the best (WATBest) and total time (WATTT) retained for analysis. Relative (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC]) and absolute (SEM) reliability of the WAT indices were quantified. Furthermore, association (Pearson's product-moment correlations and stepwise backward elimination procedure) with other fitness performance indices (10- and 40-m sprinting times, 30-15 intermittent fitness test [30-15IFT] and the Yo-Yo intermittent recovery test level 2 [YYIR2]) was investigated. Pooled values revealed ""moderate"" to ""high"" ICCs for WATBest (ICC = 0.89, p = 0.626) and WATTT (ICC = 0.95, p = 0.342).

The program was run in 2014 (Phase 1) and 2015 (Phase 2). In Phase 1 thematic analyses of nine parent interviews and pre-post parent proxy report of children's motor skills were conducted with 15 parents. In Phase 2 pre-post objective motor skill assessment was undertaken in a separate sample of 13 children. Three key themes were identified: benefit of doing something 'normal'; simple adaptations work; and, despite barriers, the benefits are worthwhile. Parent-proxy report indicated improvement in child object control skills. Objective assessment showed no change in children's motor skill. Parental experiences of the program indicated that simple accommodations can engage children with ASD and their families in organized sporting programs. Given potential psychosocial and health benefits of organized sports, further controlled studies of this type of program in children with ASD are warranted.

Many studies have examined successful passing via network analysis; however, no research has attempted to understand the broken passing connections as a network in football. Method: In a first of its kind study, we assessed a teams' unsuccessful or 'broken' passing links using network analysis. The analysis used the 2018 UEFA Champions League final between Real Madrid and Liverpool. The broken passing links were identified and analysed using network analysis to determine team and individual network characteristics. Results: Eventual winners Real Madrid had fewer players involved in the broken passing links network, compared to Liverpool. The analysis also highlights the individual contributions, in terms of passers and intended recipients within the broken passing links network. Discussion: This short communication study has demonstrated a novel use of network analysis to analyse the broken passing networks in football. This extension to the utility of network analysis in football could be used as a tool for coaches and match analysts to understand team and opposition performance. Further research is recommended to test the method across multiple games, levels of competition, and pitch location, of the broken passing links.

Various countermeasures are considered to prevent the decline in exercise performance in the heat, convenient, and practical cooling strategies attracts attention. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of wearing a new type of cooling vest which cooled torso and neck during half-time (HT) on intermittent exercise performance that imitated intermittent athletic games. All measurements on the experiments were carried out with the bicycle ergometer. Eight male soccer players performed a familiarization session and two experimental trials of a 2 × 30 min intermittent cycling exercise protocol, which consisted of a 5 s maximal power pedaling (body weight × 0.075 kp) every minutes separated by 25 s unloaded pedaling (80 rpm) and rest (30 s) in the heat (33.0°C; 50% relative humidity). The two trials included cooling-vest condition (VEST) and control condition (CON), and the difference is with or without wearing cooling vest imposed for 15 min at HT. Mean and peak power output, rectal (Tre) and skin temperature (neck, upper back, chest, right upper arm, and thigh), heart rate (HR), deep thigh temperature, rating of perceived exertion (RPE), and thermal comfort (TC) and thermal sensation (TS) were measured. Mean power output at 2nd half was significantly greater (p < 0.05) in VEST (3rd trial: 589 ± 58 W, 4th trial: 584 ± 58 W) than in CON (3rd trial: 561 ± 53 W, 4th trial: 561 ± 53 W). HR were significantly lower in VEST during HT and higher in VEST at the last maximal pedaling (p < 0.05).

However, responsible maladaptive CV phenotypes have not been fully characterized. Objective: To address the emergence and progression of multiple independent factors associated with CV risk across serial years of collegiate US football participation. Design, Setting, and Participants: Collegiate US football athletes from 2 National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I programs were recruited as freshmen between June 2014 and June 2017 and analyzed at multiple points throughout 3 complete years of collegiate US football participation (until January 2019). Excluded athletes were those who did not complete any season of US football training because of injury, illness, or leaving the team. Factors associated with CV risk assessed clinically, by transthoracic echocardiography, and by vascular applanation tonometry were recorded. Exposures: The exposure of interest was seasonal US football exposure, including training, competition, and the training environment. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcome measures were left ventricular mass index and geometry (cardiac structure), early diastolic myocardial relaxation velocity (E′; diastolic function), and pulse-wave velocity (arterial stiffness). Results: Of 186 individuals recruited as freshmen, 126 athletes were included in analyzed data. Collegiate US football athletes (62 white individuals [49%]; 63 black individuals [50%]; 77 nonlinemen [61%]; 49 linemen [39%]; 126 male individuals [100%]) weighed a mean (SD) of 101.1 (21.0) kg, with a mean systolic blood pressure of 129.1 (11.6) mm Hg at baseline of the freshman season. Adjusting for race, height, and player position, there were significant increases in weight (mean [SE] Δ, 4.74 [0.6] kg; P <.001), systolic blood pressure (mean [SE] Δ, 11.6 [1.6] mm Hg; P <.001), and pulse-wave velocity (mean [SE] Δ, 0.24 [0.09] m/s; P =.007), and significant declines in E′ (mean [SE] Δ, -1.7 [0.3] cm/s; P <.001) across 3 years of US football participation. Weight gain was associated with both arterial stiffening (increased pulse-wave velocity, β = 0.01 [SE, 0.004]; P =.003) and the development of concentric left ventricular hypertrophy (odds ratio, 1.09 [95% CI, 1.05-1.14]; P <.001); increased systolic blood pressure was also associated with arterial stiffening (β = 0.01 [SE, 0.003]; P =.007) and the development of concentric left ventricular hypertrophy (odds ratio, 1.04 [95% CI, 1.01-1.07]; P =.02). Conclusions and Relevance: Collegiate US football athletes who gain weight and develop increased systolic blood pressure levels are at risk for the development of a pathologic CV phenotype characterized by concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, arterial stiffening, and reduced left ventricular diastolic function. Future work aimed at optimizing CV health in this population, who are young but uniquely at risk, is warranted.","2019","2020-05-20 00:58:01","2020-05-20 00:58:01","","1221-1229","","12","4","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamacardio.2019.3909; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629670639","adult; football player; human; male; article; Caucasian; cardiovascular parameters; priority journal; controlled study; training; competition; race; risk assessment; body height; cardiovascular risk; clinical assessment; transthoracic echocardiography; United States; hypertension; African American; heart left ventricle hypertrophy; heart left ventricle mass; systolic blood pressure; disease association; high risk population; body weight gain; imaging software; diastole; echocardiograph; real time ultrasound scanner; arterial stiffness; early diastolic myocardial relaxation velocity; EchoPAC version 7; environment; pulse wave; tonometry; vascular applanation tonometry; Vivid-I","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cross-sectional analysis of professional team-sport players from Southeastern Europe during the competitive season","Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition","","15502783","","","Background: Issues related to knowledge of nutrition and dietary supplementation (DS) are understudied in professional athletes. This study aimed to examine the possible association between knowledge of nutrition and DS (KN&DS) and dietary supplement use (DSU) among professional athletes involved in team sports. Methods: The sample comprised professional team-sport athletes (N = 912, age: 22.11 ± 3.37 years, 356 females) involved in four Olympic sports: basketball (N = 228), soccer (N = 324), volleyball (N = 154), and handball (N = 206). The participants were tested by previously validated questionnaires to examine their self-perceived competence on nutrition and DS (S/KN&DS), their objectively evaluated (tested) KN&DS (O/KN&DS), sociodemographic and sport-specific variables (predictors), and DSU (criterion). Associations between the predictors and the criterion (No-DSU - Irregular-DSU - Regular-DSU) were determined by multinomial regression analysis for the total sample and separately for the studied sports. Results: DSU was found to be less prevalent in older and more successful players. The O/KN&DS and S/KN&DS were positively correlated with DSU, but S/KN&DS was a stronger predictor of DSU than O/KN&DS. Sport-specific associations between predictors and criterion were identified, with stronger correlations in sports with a higher prevalence of DSU. Conclusions: Due to the low correlations between O/KN&DS and S/KN&DS in the studied players, this study highlights the necessity for more frequent monitoring of biomarkers of nutritional status and its usage by coaches and practitioners to provide quantitative instruction.

No previous studies have investigated the domain-specific burden of HRP in football players actively engaged in competition, nor explored whether sex-based differences exist within this population. Methods: A cross-sectional study design was used to compare sub-elite football (Australian Rules and soccer) players with and without HRP. Symptomatic participants (HRP) were eligible for inclusion if they reported greater than six months of hip and/or groin pain and had a positive flexion/adduction/internal rotation (FADIR) test. Healthy control participants were included if they had no history of lumbar spine, hip or other lower limb injury or surgery, and a negative FADIR test. All participants completed the International Hip Outcome Tool-33 (IHOT-33) and Copenhagen Hip and Groin Outcome Score (HAGOS). Between-groups comparisons were made for individual PROMS subscales and each comparison of interest (symptomatic men (SM) vs symptomatic women (SW), SM vs asymptomatic men (AM), and SW versus asymptomatic women (AW)) using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and controlling for the effects of between-group differences in body mass index (BMI) and symptom duration as appropriate. All statistical analysis was completed in SPSS v25 and alpha level was set at 0.05. Results: 187 (149 M, 38W) symptomatic and 55 (41 M, 14 W) asymptomatic football players were included for analysis. Symptomatic men reported significantly longer symptom duration (MD 16 months [95 % CI 2.28 to 30.30], p = 0.023) and higher BMI (MD 3.4 kg/m2 [95 %CI 0.96 to 6.19], p = 0.003) when compared to SW. Symptomatic men and SW were significantly worse on all IHOT–33 and HAGOS subscales when compared to healthy controls of the same sex (p ≤ 0.001). Within the symptomatic football players, SW reported significantly worse symptoms (MD–5.84 [95 %CI–11.13 to–0.55], p = 0.031) and pain (MD–7.07 [95 %CI–12.02 to–2.11], p = 0.005) using the HAGOS subscales when compared to SM. Discussion: Football players with HRP who are still engaged in competition report a considerable hip-related burden. When compared to asymptomatic football players, those with HRP describe worse physical impairments, and report reduced function, participation and performance during competitive football. Reports of reduced quality of life in football players with HRP may reflect the symptomatic player's inability to meet the greater physical demands of football and perform at their desired level. There is no clinically important difference in the described burden of the condition between sexes.

A prospective clinical study","Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport","","1878-1861 1440-2440","10.1016/j.jsams.2019.08.188","","Introduction: Recent prospective studies of elite male players from the Australian Football League (AFL) have established that decreased size of the multifidus muscle at the L5 vertebral level was associated with an increased odds of lower limb injuries in the playing season. Before this information can be routinely applied in clinical settings, it is first necessary to validate the usefulness of the identified risk factor, by trialing it in samples which are independent of the populations from which the predictive models were created. This study therefore aimed to test the usefulness of a previously identified injury risk factor (small multifidus muscle) in an independent sample of elite AFL football players. Methods: A prospective study of forty-three players from a professional AFL club was conducted. Cross-sectional areas (CSAs) of the multifidus muscle were measured from ultrasound images collected during the pre-season. Injuries were monitored and recorded by club personnel over the AFL playing season. ROC curves were used to determine clinical cut points. Logistic regression, using a forward sequential method, was used to evaluate the usefulness of multifidus muscle size for predicting the lower limb injuries which occurred in the playing season. Results: Fifteen players (35 %) sustained a lower limb injury during the playing season. Results of the logistic regression analysis showed that players with a small multifidus at L5 (less than clinical cut-off of 8.8 cm2, AUC = 0.806; p = 0.001) had increased odds of sustaining a lower limb injury in the playing season (OR 35, 95 % CI 3.9 to 312.2, p = 0.001). Discussion: Results of this study confirmed previous findings that a decreased size of the multifidus muscle at the lumbo-sacral junction was associated with increased odds of sustaining a lower limb injury during the AFL playing season. While this result has been previously demonstrated in other research studies, the next step in determining the clinical utility of this measure would be to examine the efficacy, feasibility and adherence of players to a pre-season training program aimed at increasing the size of the multifidus muscles in players with muscle size below the clinical cut-off.","2019","2020-05-20 00:58:07","2020-05-20 00:58:07","","S28","","","22","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsams.2019.08.188; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002914836","conference abstract; football player; human; lower limb; injury; controlled study; prospective study; season; training; receiver operating characteristic; multifidus muscle; muscle mass; ultrasound; risk factor; feasibility study; sequential analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To date, diagnosis is based on the realization of clinical tests conducted pitch-side. Yet, the potential effect of prior physical effort on the results of these tests remains poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to determine whether preceding physical effort can influence the outcome of concussion assessments. DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING: University Medicine Center. PATIENTS: A cohort of 40 subjects (20 rugby players and 20 athletes from a range of sports). INTERVENTION: A concussion assessment was performed immediately after physical activity. After a period of 6 months and under the same experimental conditions, the same cohort performed the same tests in resting conditions. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Results of concussion tests. RESULTS: In both cohorts, the comparison for postexercise and rest assessments demonstrated a most likely moderate-to-very large increase in the number of symptoms, severity of symptoms, and balance error scoring system score. In the rugby cohort, scores for concentration, delayed memory and standardized assessment of concussion (SAC), likely-to-most likely decreased following completion of physical activity compared with baseline values. The between-cohort comparison reported a most likely greater impact after exercise in the rugby players for delayed recall (0.73 ± 0.61) and SAC score (0.75 ± 0.41). CONCLUSIONS: Physical activity altered the results of concussion diagnostic tests in athletes from a range of sports and notably in rugby players. Therefore, physical efforts before the concussion incident should be accounted for during pitch-side assessments and particularly during rugby competition and training.","2019","2020-05-20 00:58:12","2020-05-20 00:58:12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/JSM.0000000000000757; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628445771","adult; female; human; male; article; rugby; clinical article; exercise; observational study; physical activity; controlled study; prospective study; scoring system; competition; athlete; cohort analysis; concussion; memory; pitch; rest; diagnosis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Eighteen variables were analysed, divided into tactical (ball possession), physical (distance covered, sprints and intensity zones 1 [low] to 5 [high]) and technical indicators (passing, shots and corners). The losing teams had lower ball possession in the group stage when compared to the winners (p = .04). There was a tendency (p = .06) for winners to spend more time in high intensity (group stage). Winners also had a tendency towards greater passing success (p = .06), shots (p = .05) and shots on target (p < .01). In summary, the winning teams have greater ball possession and pass success during the group stage of the 2018 FIFA WC, in addition to spending more time at high intensities and achieving more shots and shots on target independent of whether the match was performed in the group or final knockout stage. Our findings do not suggest any additional physical, tactical or technical variable in the determination of success in high-level soccer competition.

Justice and desert of sport contests, in part, rely on officiating truths (performances) that arise from an appropriate admixture of epistemic (judgements) and metaphysical (actions) ingredients. This paper provides a rigorous and original philosophical analysis of the problems of obeying and applying the rules of sport. The paper focuses on a the scrum in rugby union. The scrum has become a focus of criticism and bewilderment. Elite rugby is damaged as a spectacle because too much time is wasted setting and re-setting scrums. Furthermore, trust in the fairness of games is eroded because the scrum is a 'lottery'. In this paper, we identify two fundamental structural problems which contribute to the scrum controversy. First, we argue that officials cannot make reliable judgements about scrums because they cannot see what they need to see. Secondly, we argue that players cannot follow the laws of the scrum even if they have a strong desire to do so. Consequently, the scrum is not only potentially dangerous, but also flawed in terms of its capacity to actualise an intended part of the game.

Methods: We reviewed 13 consecutive senior AFL players who underwent plate fixation by the senior author over a 10 year period.

Results: The median time to return to competition play was 3 weeks (range 2 to 16 weeks) f and all fractures eventually united. Three of the nine players (33%) that returned before 6 weeks post-operatively suffered significant impacts that caused a bend in the plates.

Occupational stress involved in sports officiating is so high that officials ranked closely behind air traffic controllers, inner city teachers, and police officers when it comes to most stressful jobs. Nevertheless, referees are only human, and mistakes will be made; however, these errors are often under intense scrutiny. Referees in Australian Football League (AFL) face a difficult task when compared to their counterparts from other sports due to the absence of a no “off-side” rule. Experiencing high levels of stress while refereeing could lead to negative psychological and somatic effects on the referees’ health ranging from decreased satisfaction to various levels of burnout. Examples of stress among referees include verbal abuse from coaches, athletes and spectators, making a controversial call, lack of recognition, poor performance, interpersonal conflict, and time pressure. Methods: Seventy-two umpires, with 1–26 years of experience umpiring AFL games completed the online survey at the start of the 2019 AFL season. Umpires completed the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ), the 21-item version of the depression, anxiety, and stress scale (DASS), and the 22-item Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI). The wording of some of the MBI items was modified to reflect the specific working circumstances of the umpiring community. Results: The three MBI scales of emotional exhaustion, personal accomplishment, and depersonalisation were used in multiple linear regression analyses to predict scores on the DASS scales, as well as the total GHQ. Depersonalisation was not a significant predictor in any of the analyses (p >.33); however, emotional exhaustion significantly predicted all outcome measures, explaining 15% of the variability in depression (p =.001), 11 % in anxiety (p =.003), 5% in stress (p = 042), and 10% in GHQ scores (p =.005). Personal accomplishment also significantly contributed to 5% and 12% of variability in depression (p =.047) and stress (p =.003), respectively. Discussion: The findings corroborate earlier work with AFL coaches in that indices of job burnout, particularly emotional exhaustion, significantly predict psychological distress. Emotional exhaustion also appears to play a crucial role in the general well-being of umpires. These results are in line with the recurrent findings that football industry employees may feel exhausted and overextended due to constant scrutiny from players, management, and the fans. It is, therefore, imperative to implement strategies to enhance work-life balance in umpires.","2019","2020-05-20 00:58:19","2020-05-20 00:58:19","","S50","","","22","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsams.2019.08.236; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002914908","conference abstract; human; football; controlled study; season; athlete; outcome assessment; anxiety; satisfaction; work-life balance; wellbeing; General Health Questionnaire; burnout; mental stress; employee; depersonalization; Depression Anxiety Stress Scale; emotional stress; conflict; verbal hostility","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The present study also sought to determine which anthropometric and physical performance variables were predictive of playing standard. Thirty professional and 30 amateur RU players performed Wattbike 6 s maximal effort (WB6S) and countermovement (CMJ) and squat jump (SJ) assessments, anthropometric measures were also taken. Dependant variables recorded and analysed including: body mass, stature, Σ8 site skinfolds, WB6S absolute and relative peak power, CMJ and SJ average concentric force, jump height, peak velocity, time to peak force, rate of force development (RFD) and absolute and relative peak force and power. Professional players were heavier, taller and leaner than their amateur counterparts (p < 0.05). Professional players performed significantly better in all physical performance measures except CMJ and SJ time to peak force, CMJ RFD and SJ relative peak force. Variables which were predictive of playing standard were: Σ8 skinfolds, CMJ peak velocity and WB6S absolute and relative peak power (p < 0.05). These findings indicate that the current body of male professional RU players is anthropometrically and physically superior to their amateur counterparts, although not all variables assessed here were predictive of playing standard. Data presented here indicate that Σ8 skinfolds, WB6S absolute and relative power and CMJ peak velocity are predictive of playing standard, whereas other anthropometric and strength and power variables are not.

Outcomes are highly variable (return to play: 0-102 days, re-injury: 4% to 16%) and little is known about factors that impact prognosis. The aim of this study was to determine whether clinical and radiological factors are predictive of (i) return to play, and (ii) re-injury. Methods: This study evaluated 149 CMSI in 123 Australian Football League players. Clinical data included intrinsic characteristics, mechanism of injury, the injury type (index, re-injury), and the number of days to return to play. All CMSI underwent standardized MRI classification by two independent, blinded radiologists: (i) strain position, (ii) anatomical location of injury, (iii) presence and extent of connective tissue disruption (CTD: 0%, < 50%, 50% to 99%, 100%), and (iv) waviness. Univariate analyses and multiple Cox regressions were used to determine whether clinical (age, history of previous CMSI, mechanism of injury) and radiological factors were associated with return to play and re-injury. Results: Soleus injuries (n = 126, 84.6%) were most commonly located at the lateral (30.2%), medial (23%), and central (16.7%) intramuscular aponeuroses. Of the 17 gastrocnemius injuries (11.4%) most involved the anterior intermuscular aponeurosis (medial: 47.1%, lateral: 41.2%). There were no significant differences in the number of days to return to play when comparing the anatomical location of injury (p >0.05 for all); but soleus injuries with CTD took 9.5 days longer to return to play than injuries with no CTD (mean 29.4 ±15.4 vs 19.9 ± 11.4 days, p = 0.03). Multiple Cox regression showed CTD to be predictive of a worse prognosis for return to play (HR = 0.48, p = 0.01), as was a running mechanism of injury (HR = 0.55, p = 0.02). Re-injuries almost exclusively involved soleus (91.4%) and the cumulative incidence was highest within 2 months of the index strain (46.9%). At baseline 65.6% had evidence of CTD but having a history of previous CMSI at the time of the index strain (HR: 5.6, p = 0.006) was the only factor predictive of re-injury from multiple Cox regression. Discussion: For return to play, clinical and radiological factors together assist with estimating prognosis: a running mechanism of injury and evidence of CTD on MRI. For re-injury, clinical factors provide the greatest prognostic value: whether the athlete has a history of previous CMSI, and soleus involvement.","2019","2020-05-20 00:58:23","2020-05-20 00:58:23","","S19","","","22","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsams.2019.08.167; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002914856","conference abstract; human; football; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; controlled study; incidence; major clinical study; athlete; running; prognosis; radiologist; soft tissue injury; gastrocnemius muscle; univariate analysis; triceps surae muscle; aponeurosis; connective tissue","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These models have focused exclusively on industrial and financial companies. However, a specific model that reflects the special characteristics of the football industry has not yet been created. Since recently the governing bodies of the football industry have increased the financial control of the clubs, as in the case of UEFA with the approval of the Financial Fair Play Regulation and demand a pronouncement on going concern in the annual financial statements of clubs as well as presenting a break-even deficit caused by losses, it seems necessary to have a model adapted to the characteristics of this industry. The present study provides a new model of prediction of financial distress for the football industry with an accuracy that exceeds 90%. It also offers a vision of the challenges facing the football industry in financial matters, helping the different interest groups to assess the financial solvency expectations of the clubs.","2019","2020-05-20 00:58:30","2020-05-20 00:58:30","","","","12","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0225989; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2004445878","human; article; football; prediction; financial management; sports organization; logistic regression analysis; financial distress; financial fair play; financial statement; law; multilayer perceptron; Union of European Football Association","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, despite record crowds and unprecedented media attention, an increase in participation by women after the event was neither significant, nor sustained in the hosting region or nationally. As identified in Parliamentary committee evidence, grass roots women's football has continued to struggle, despite strategies investing heavily development and the 'Superleague' to drive increased engagement in the game after 2005. Success in international events in 2012, 2015, and 2017 by England national teams showed spikes in media interest, audiences and progression on the field of play. However, an examination of national participation statistics demonstrates the difficulties of evidencing sport participation event legacy. The event in 2005 clearly contributed to changing public perceptions, stimulating a new strategic focus on women by the Football Association and therefore began the new era for the game, particularly in England. This research may provide some insight for planning for Euro 2021 – when football 'comes home' once again.

We tested the alternative hypothesis that exposure to concussion or repetitive subclinical head impacts throughout early life may stunt acquisition of word-reading skills.Method: Data were obtained from student-athletes within the CARE Consortium that completed the Wechsler Test of Adult Reading (WTAR). Measures of head trauma burden included self-reported concussion history and cumulative years of exposure to collision sports. We evaluated the effects of head trauma, sociodemographic (race, SES), and academic (SAT/ACT scores, learning disorder) variables on WTAR standard score using linear regression. Analyses were repeated in a football-only subsample estimating age of first exposure to football as a predictor.Results: We analyzed data from 6,598 participants (72.2% white, 39.6% female, mean ± SD age = 18.8 ± 1.2 years). Head trauma variables collectively explained 0.1% of the variance in WTAR standard scores, with years of collision sport exposure weakly predicting lower WTAR standard scores (β = .026-.035, very small effect). In contrast, sociodemographic and academic variables collectively explained 20.9-22.5% of WTAR standard score variance, with strongest effects noted for SAT/ACT scores (β = .313-.337, medium effect), LD diagnosis (β = -.115 to -.131, small effect), and SES (β = .101-.108, small effect). Age of first exposure to football did not affect WTAR scores in a football-only sample.Conclusion: Wechsler Test of Adult Reading performance appears unrelated to history of self-reported concussion(s) and/or repetitive subclinical head trauma exposure in current collegiate athletes.

The year-round program—marketed as a campaign to end childhood obesity—now holds significance influence over school curriculums and operations, public constructions of health and diet, and governmental recommendations and policies on health and exercise. This article argues that the emergence of the Play 60 campaign as a major influence in these areas reflects the increasing privatization of physical education and wellness in U.S. schools. Furthermore, the program serves the commercial and political interests of the league by instilling familiarity with the labor and verbiage of football in program participants and advocating for the role of athletes (and the leagues they are a part of) in influencing youth ideas regarding nutrition and health. Most importantly, the program situates football as a safe and healthy practice for children amid increasing societal awareness and concern over the substantial health risks associated with playing youth football.

External and internal workloads were determined for 44 training sessions and 16 competitive matches using a 10-Hz global positioning system (GPS) and a 200-Hz accelerometer/heart rate monitor. Training loads were registered from day five (D-5) to day one (D-1) prior to each competitive match. Workload efficiency was calculated for each match as the ratio between overall external and internal load. A multiple stepwise regression analysis (including z-transformed variables) was used to determine training load variables that predict workload efficiency of the following matches. Training load variables of the previous days explained 26.6% of the variance in workload efficiency during the following matches. Long sprinting distance on D-3 and D-4 and total distance on D-1 positively influenced the players' workload efficiency, whereas long training durations and high training load on D-1 showed adverse effects. The present outcomes suggest that including sprint training (high sprinting distance) four and three days prior to a match, may provide a positive stimulus for the subsequent workload efficiency in matches. The negative impact of long training duration and high training load one day before the game highlights the importance of a diligent planning of the immediate competition preparation phase. This study shows that workload efficiency is a useful metric to assess match performance and that body-worn sensor technology can be useful for tailoring training loads.","2019","2020-05-20 00:58:39","2020-05-20 00:58:39","","1-17","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17461391.2019.1697374; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629961850","human; article; football; soccer; heart rate; workload; accelerometer; competition; athlete; motion; global positioning system; sensor","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: A total of 130 elite football players, from 5 teams playing European competitions, have been followed during a season. The internal workload was calculated using the Session Rate of Perceived Exertion method and the injuries were recorded. The 4-weeks, 3-weeks, 2-weeks and 1-week monotony (mean workload divided by workload standard deviation) and strain (absolute workload multiplied by monotony) were calculated on a daily basis, using a rolling days method. Results: The 4-weeks monotony was related to injury incidence. The relative risk (RR) of injury is decreased with an increase in 4-weeks monotony (RR = 0.72, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.58–0.90; P = 0.004). The injury incidence was related to the 4-weeks strain. The RR of injury is increased with an increase 4-weeks strain (RR = 1.50, 95% CI 1.14–1.97; P = 0.004).

The participants completed Yo-Yo IE2 tests on three separate occasions with assessment of performance, heart rate, running speed, accelerations, decelerations and body load using GPS instrumentation. The intra-class correlation coefficient index, confidence intervals and coefficients of variation were calculated to assess the reliability of the test. Intra-class correlation coefficients for test-retest trials in the total sample ranged from large to nearly perfect (total distance: 0.896; mean speed: 0.535; maximum speed: 0.715; mean HR: 0.876; maximum HR: 0.866; body load: 0.865). The coefficients of variation for distance, mean speed, HR response, as well as acceleration and deceleration scores for test-retest trials ranged from 1.2 to 12.5% with no differences observed among particular sport disciplines. The CV for shuttles performed ranged from 4.4 to 5.5% in all sports. Similar results were obtained for the three different categories of players tested. These results suggest that the Yo-Yo IE2 test appears to be a reliable alternative for evaluating the ability to perform intermittent high-intensity running in different outdoor and indoor team sports. Players may need one or two familiarization tests to ensure valid assessment of intermittent endurance capacity. It appears that the Yo-Yo IE2 test incorporates accelerations and decelerations in a consistent and reproducible fashion.

These follow-ups aim to identify abnormal behavior by comparing the individual's biological samples to an established baseline. These comparisons may be done via different ways, but each of them requires an appropriate extra population to compute the significance levels, which is a non-trivial issue. Moreover, it is not necessarily relevant to compare the measures of a biomarker of a professional athlete to that of a reference population (even restricted to other athletes), and a reasonable alternative is to detect the abnormal values by considering only the other measurements of the same athlete. Here we propose a simple adaptive statistic based on maxima of Z-scores that does not rely on the use of an extra population. We show that, in the Gaussian framework, it is a practical and relevant method for detecting abnormal values in a series of observations from the same individual. The distribution of this statistic does not depend on the individual parameters under the null hypothesis, and its quantiles can be computed using Monte Carlo simulations. The proposed method is tested on the 3-year follow-up of ferritin, serum iron, erythrocytes, hemoglobin, and hematocrit markers in 2577 elite male soccer players. For instance, if we consider the abnormal values for the hematocrit at a 5% level, we found that 5.57% of the selected cohort had at least one abnormal value (which is not significantly different from the expected false-discovery rate). The approach is a starting point for more elaborate models that would produce a refined individual baseline. The method can be extended to the Gaussian linear model, in order to include additional variables such as the age or exposure to altitude. The method could also be applied to other domains, such as the clinical patient follow-up in monitoring abnormal values of biological markers.","2019","2020-05-20 00:58:50","2020-05-20 00:58:50","","48-64","","1","20","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/biostatistics/kxx044; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L625565777","adult; human; male; soccer; statistics and numerical data; athlete; iron; procedures; reference value; statistical model; blood; ferritin; physiologic monitoring; blood examination; normal distribution; biostatistics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this work was the assessment of the influence of implementing corrective strategies and functional training according to the Functional Movement System approach on the improvement of functional capacity in professional soccer players. Material and methods. Twenty players and 30 people undertaking recreational physical activity were assessed by the application of the Functional Movement Screen. Corrective strategies based on the Funclional Movement Screen score were planned for a group of soccer players for a period of one month. Results. The result of FMS conducted before the implementation of the corrective stralegies was almost 2 polnts higher for the soccer players in comparison with the conlrol group. After introducing the corrective strategies the result of the test for the soccer players was 18.2 points and it was higher than be lore the implementation of corrective exercises (17.4 polnts). The amount of polnts obtained in the test by the players undergoing corrective exercises was higher in comparison with the sporlsman to whom corrective exercises were not applied and constituted 18.2 and 17.2 polnts accordingly. Conclusions. The application of appropriate corlective tralning melhods based on the Functional Movement Syslem concept to typical soccer tralnings may substantially increase functional performance of athletes, simultaneously decreasing the risk of injury. Typical training units do not affect the improvement of abnormal global movement patterns, however, increase the risk of inl ury in soccer players.

Indeed, previous research has demonstrated reduced performance after concussion in American football and baseball, and mixed findings in ice hockey. Preliminary research in the Australian Football League (AFL) indicates no changes in player disposal rates after concussion. However, the effects of concussion on a more comprehensive array of performance metrics is unclear. This study aimed to compare AFL player performance before and after concussion using a broad array of performance metrics that have not been previously considered. Methods: Thirty-seven concussed players who played 3–4 AFL matches immediately before and after sustaining a concussion were identified using public AFL injury lists during the 2017 and 2018 competitive seasons. Official match statistics were used to determine player performance based on disposals (total and contested disposals), disposal efficiency, errors, marks (total and contested marks), tackles, and AFL fantasy points (an advanced measure used to indicate overall player performance). Comparisons were made using mixed models that included concussion (pre vs post), match (matches 1–4), and concussion*match interaction as fixed effects, player as a random effect, and percentage match time as a covariate. Mean differences (MD) and 95 % confidence intervals were used to quantify any effects of concussion. Results: There were no concussion*match interactions for any performance metrics (p ≥ 0.088). Performance was not different after concussion for total disposals (MD: 1 ± 1 disposals; p = 0.239), contested disposals (MD: 0 ± 1 disposals; p = 0.781), disposal efficiency (MD: -1 ± 1 %; p = 0.570), errors (MD: 0.2 ± 0.3 errors; p = 0.369), total marks (MD: 0.2 ± 0.6 marks; p = 0.485), contested marks (MD: 0.0 ± 0.2 marks; p = 0.735), tackles (MD: -0.1 ± 0.4 tackles; p = 0.823), and AFL fantasy points (MD: 2 ± 5 points; p = 0.390). Discussion: Concussion did not affect AFL player performance across a broad array of performance metrics. The null findings for contested disposals, contested marks and tackles suggest that players engage in a similar number of contact situations after returning from concussion. Disposal efficiency and number of errors were also unaffected by concussion. This suggests that player skill and decision making is maintained in the context of AFL tasks and scenarios that have been well rehearsed through previous training and match experience. The current concussion rehabilitation strategies used in the AFL appear to be effective for maintaining AFL player performance.

It is through the diligence, professionalism and training of umpires that allows players to complete in sports matches on a level playing field. Nevertheless, this umpiring cohort is vulnerable to stressors from outside sources and job-related pressures. A lack of respect, abuse from players, coaches and spectators, as well as criticism from the media are factors that contribute to the stress of a game-day official, which may compromise decision-making abilities. While a relationship between increased levels of stress and match officiating has been identified, an in-depth examination of AFL umpires is yet to be conducted. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore the experiences of job-related stress in elite AFL umpires, Methods: Twenty participants took part in a 45–minute focus group interview, examining sources of occupational stress, workplace challenges, and job burnout. An interpretive thematic analysis using inductive and deductive reasoning was used to analyse the data. Results: Analysis of the focus group data indicate that the physical demands and challenges of the role can impact on the health and wellbeing of an umpire. Decision making, the ability to perform consistently and the constant rule changes were key factors that contribute to challenges umpires face in their occupation. Conversely, umpires identified both positive and negative factors that influence performance, as well as successful and maladaptive strategies to cope with the demands. Discussion: Findings from the study align with previous quantitative research which highlights that some umpires can cope with the constant pressures of the job; however, for others, they may be more susceptible to psychological distress from job exhaustion. This study provides greater conceptual clarity of the pressures experienced by AFL umpires and has important implications regarding the workplace environment, job roles, and management of umpires within the industry. This study provides information that will lead to improved knowledge of umpires’ occupational pressure and shape resource development and identify support opportunities for this unique group of individuals who form an integral part of the game.","2019","2020-05-20 00:59:16","2020-05-20 00:59:16","","S105","","","22","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsams.2019.08.140; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002901964","adult; conference abstract; female; human; male; football; clinical article; controlled study; decision making; exhaustion; interview; thematic analysis; quantitative analysis; wellbeing; mental health; burnout; mental stress; job stress; occupation; workplace; deductive reasoning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: Match running movements (GPS) were recorded during 7 AFLW (n = 91 files) and 13 VFLW (n = 263 files) competition matches. Results: AFLW players covered moderately greater relative high-speed running (HSR, 14.4-18.0 km·h−1, AFLW 14.9 ± 5.7 m·min−1; VFLW 12.2 ± 3.9 m·min−1; ES = 0.61, ±0.39), very high-speed running (VHSR, 18.0-20.0 km·h−1, 4.2 ± 2.0 m·min−1; 3.2 ± 1.4 m·min−1; ES = 0.61, ±0.14), and sprint (>20 km·h−1, 3.3 ± 2.2 m·min−1; 2.1 ± 1.6 m·min−1; ES = 0.65, ±0.16) distances than VFLW players. Small to large differences were apparent within positions between competitions for HSR, VHSR, and sprint distances, most notably in small forwards (ES = 0.78-1.45). VHSR and sprint distances decreased in the fourth quarter when compared with quarters one and two (ES = 0.22-0.33) in the AFLW competition, whereas VFLW match running movements remained consistent across quarters. Conclusions: These differences may reflect the variations in match rules between competitions (fewer on-field players and shorter match time in AFLW), providing greater on-field space per player and interchange frequency. This information can assist in prescribing appropriate training for women's AF competition.

Deceleration, acceleration, and impacts are strong contributors to muscle damage in professional Australian football. J Strength Cond Res 33(12): 3374-3383, 2019-The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationships between serum creatine kinase [CK], an indirect marker of muscle damage, and specific indices of match load in elite Australian football. Twenty-six professional players were assessed during a competitive Australian Football League (AFL) season. [CK] was collected 24-36 hours before match and 34-40 hours after match during 8 in-season rounds. An athlete-tracking technology was used to quantify match load. Generalized estimating equations and random forest models were constructed to determine the extent to which match-load indices and pre-match [CK] explained post-match [CK]. There was a 129 ± 152% increase in [CK] in response to AFL competition. Generalized estimating equations found that number of impacts >3g (p = 0.004) and game time (p = 0.016) were most strongly associated with post-match [CK]. Random forest, with considerably lower errors (130 vs. 316 U·L), found deceleration, acceleration, impacts >3g, and sprint distance to be the strongest predictors. Pre-match [CK] accounted for 11% of post-match [CK], and considerable interindividual and intraindividual variability existed in the data. Creatine kinase, an indicator of muscle damage, was considerably elevated as a result of AFL competition. Parametric and machine-learning analysis techniques found several indices of physical load associated with muscle damage during competition, with impacts >3g and high-intensity running variables as the strongest predictors. [CK] may be used as a global measure of muscle damage in field team sports such as AF, yet with some caution given cost, invasiveness, and inherent variability. Quantifying physical load and the responses to that load can guide athlete management decision-making and is best undertaken within a suite of practical, sport-specific measures, where data are interpreted individually and with an understanding of the limitations.","2019","2020-05-20 00:59:23","2020-05-20 00:59:23","","3374-3383","","12","33","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Medline","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1519/JSC.0000000000003023; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629955935","adult; human; male; football; injury; acceleration; adolescent; young adult; deceleration; running; pathology; creatine kinase; biological marker; Australia; skeletal muscle; blood; adverse event; blunt trauma","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, it is unclear whether the detrimental effect is different to the increased injury risk following other injury types. Such knowledge would inform injury prevention strategies during concussion rehabilitation and subsequent return to play. This study aimed to compare subsequent injury rates, regions, and timeframes in elite Australian football players who sustained concussion and non-concussion injuries. Methods: Public Australian Football League (AFL) injury lists were monitored during the 2017 and 2018 competitive seasons to identify injured players. Injured players were split into two groups based on whether their first injury of the season was a concussion (concussion group) or a non-head knock related injury (control group). Subsequent injury rates per/1000 games and subsequent injury body regions (head, upper limb, trunk, lower limb and illness) were compared between groups using incident rate ratios (IRR) and Chi-square tests, respectively. Subgroup comparisons were performed based on concussion severity (number of weeks injured) and the timing of the subsequent injury (number of weeks after the concussion). Results: Ninety-six concussion and 663 control injured players were identified. Subsequent injury rates were not different between concussion and control groups (IRR 1.02 [95 % CI: 0.78–1.33]; p = 0.894). Players returning from a concussion were less likely to sustain subsequent lower limb injuries (52.4 % vs 69.7 %, respectively; p = 0.010) and more likely to sustain subsequent head, upper limb or trunk injuries (41.3 % vs 25.4 %, respectively; p = 0.013). Subsequent illness rates were not different between concussion and control groups (6.3 % vs 5.0 %, respectively; p = 0.871). Subsequent injury rates were similar amongst concussed players who were injured for 1, 2, and > 2 weeks (67 vs 87 vs 51 injuries/1000games, respectively; p > 0.289) and also similar in games 1–4, 5–8, 9–12, and > 12 after returning to play (45 vs 65 vs 79 vs 52 injuries/1000games, respectively; p > 0.180). Discussion: These findings suggest that subsequent injury rate is similar between concussion and other injury types, regardless of concussion severity and number of games since returning to play. Subsequent injuries following a concussion were more likely to occur in the head, upper limb and trunk compared to typical AFL injuries. The reasons for this should be further explored and considered within concussion rehabilitation and return to play programs.

However, to date there have only been a few studies examining the efficacy of training programs aimed at increasing multifidus muscle size. The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of a functional resistance program designed to induce hypertrophy of the lumbar multifidus muscles during the AFL pre-season. Method: Forty-seven players were recruited from a professional AFL club. All players underwent a validated assessment of their multifidus muscle size using ultrasound imaging at the beginning and end of the intervention period. Based on results from the previous season, a pre-determined CSA of 8.2 cm2 was used as a clinical cut-off for season soft tissue injury risk. Twenty players with a CSA of the multifidus muscle less than 8.2 cm2 at L5 (left or right side) were placed in the intervention group, while the remaining players acted as a control group. The intervention group underwent a targeted functional resistance training program consisting of 4-5 exercises (15 min) three times a week for 12 weeks. Players from both groups participated in their usual scheduled weights and team training sessions. Results: No statistical difference was noted between the groups at baseline for height, weight, age or player age. There was an increase in the average size of the multifidus muscle in the intervention group from 7.55 cm2 + /- SD 0.83 to 8.63 cm2 + /- 0.71 (Mean diff = 1.08 cm2 + /- 0.77, P = 0.001, ES = 1.4 95%CI (0.7 - 2.1)), compared with the control group 9.96 cm2 + /- 1.35 to 10.15 cm2 + /- 0.92 (Mean Diff = 0.19 + /- 1.13, P = 0.03, ES = 0.33 (-0.24 – 0.53)). This represents a 15% increase in multifidus CSA in players who underwent the intervention, compared with a 2.6% increase in players in the control group. The increase in size placed 13 of 20 players in the intervention group above the 8.2 cm2 cut-off. The greatest change occurred in the players with smaller multifidus muscles pre-intervention. Discussion: Multifidus muscle atrophy exists in high performance male athletes. This has been shown to be a risk factor for lower limb soft tissue injuries. The implementation of a functional resistance program significantly increased the CSA of the L5 multifidus muscle. The effect of this intervention on player injury risk is an area of future research.","2019","2020-05-20 00:59:27","2020-05-20 00:59:27","","S39","","","22","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsams.2019.08.212; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002914948","adult; conference abstract; human; male; lower limb; controlled study; prospective study; season; athlete; resistance training; multifidus muscle; muscle mass; ultrasound; risk factor; soft tissue injury; atrophy; intervention study; hypertrophy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Data from professional male athletes (years 24.4 ± 3.7; cm 185.9 ± 7.1; kg 85.4 ± 7.1), were collected via 10 Hz global positioning system (GPS) during a competitive AFL match. Five spatiotemporal metrics (x-axis centroid, y–axis centroid, length, width, and surface area), occupancy maps, and Shannon Entropy (ShannEn) were analysed by match phase (offensive, defensive, and contested) and field position (defensive 50, defensive midfield, forward midfield, and forward 50). A multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) revealed that field position had a greater influence on the x-axis centroid comparative to match phase. Conversely, match phase had a greater influence on length, width, and surface area comparative to field position. Occupancy maps revealed that players repositioned behind centre when the ball was in their defensive half and moved forward of centre when the ball was in their forward half. Shannon Entropy revealed that player movement was more variable during offence and defence (ShannEn = 0.82–0.93) compared to contest (ShannEn = 0.68–0.79). Spatiotemporal metrics, occupancy maps, and Shannon Entropy may assist in understanding the game style of AF teams.

Whilst deficits in trunk and hip muscle function associated with low back pain have been demonstrated in elite male Australian football and soccer players, little is known about this relationship in female Australian football players. This exploratory study aimed to examine the size and function of trunk and hip muscles in elite female AFL players with and without low back pain. Methods: Twelve female players from a professional AFL club participated in this cross-sectional study. In the preseason, presence and history of low back pain, including duration of symptoms, was assessed using questionnaires. Presence of recent low back pain was established using a rating of pain intensity for the past week on a visual analogue scale. Size and function of the trunk and hip muscles were assessed with ultrasound imaging using previously published protocols. Independent-samples t-tests were conducted to compare muscle size and function between players with and without low back pain. Significance was set at p < 0.10. Results: 58 % of players reported low back pain in the last week with an average rating of pain intensity of 4.9 (2.1) cm and an average duration of 9.6 (6.8) weeks. In players with low back pain, size of the multifidus muscle at L5 was smaller on the kicking leg (p = 0.007) and the gluteus medius muscle was smaller on the stance leg (p = 0.059). Low back pain was associated with increased contraction of the multifidus muscle at L5 (p = 0.02) and decreased contraction of the internal oblique muscle on the stance leg (p = 0.001). Discussion: Similar to results of previous research on male football players, deficits in trunk and hip muscle size and altered function were found in female football players with low back pain. These preliminary findings may be important as a previous prospective study of 259 elite male AFL players showed that players with recent low back pain and players with a smaller multifidus muscle on the kicking leg had higher odds of sustaining a lower limb injury. As the reported changes in lumbopelvic muscle function have been shown to be amenable to intervention in elite male football players, further research aimed at identification of modifiable factors in female football players with low back pain may be warranted.","2019","2020-05-20 00:59:31","2020-05-20 00:59:31","","S96","","","22","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Embase","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsams.2019.08.120; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002901976","adult; conference abstract; female; football player; human; male; injury; controlled study; prospective study; questionnaire; cross-sectional study; muscle function; leg; multifidus muscle; muscle mass; trunk; ultrasound; visual analog scale; hip muscle; standing; exploratory research; gluteus medius muscle; low back pain; oblique internal abdominal muscle; pain intensity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
