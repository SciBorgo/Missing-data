# missing data examples relevant to sports (MAR, MCAR, MNAR)

For example, if a players' player ratings\--a statistic derived from
many variables in the dataset\--are unavailable for one, or several,
Australian Football matches, despite the individual participating in the
match and the other variables being recorded.

MCAR refers to missingness that is unrelated to any observed or
unobserved data. Missing Australian Football player ratings could be
considered MCAR, if the missing ratings are not systematically related
to other variables. MAR is where missingness is related to some observed
data. Data MAR could arise if\... \^\^Rob's out on the full
example\--players who are injured are less likely to fill out wellness
surveys than those who are fully fit.\^\^. MNAR is when missingness is
related to something unobservable. For example, data MNAR could arise
when, if studying doping, a player was to remove their head and body
hair, to avoid providing a hair sample for testing
[\[4\]](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?4Ildjf). In this case, data
is missing (the hair sample), and this information is not captured by
any other variable that was collected (hair length was not recorded).
