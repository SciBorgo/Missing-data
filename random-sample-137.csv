Semistructured interviews were conducted with 10 elite coaches to determine their perceptions of the characteristics, emergence, and impact of highly influential players. The interview guide was anchored in coaching literature and leadership theory, and after the interview data in this frame were explored, these athletes were labeled cultural architects. The results of the analysis revealed 3 general dimensions of cultural architects in elite teams: (a) personal characteristics, which include elements related to their achievements on the soccer pitch, mind-set, and collective orientation; (b) relationship to the coach, which includes integrity and trust; and (c) intrateam facilitator, which includes their impact as a task-team and social-team influencer. The results represent original findings identifying the characteristics of cultural architects in soccer that are most likely transferable to many other team sports.

In a 20-month period, 111 academy football players aged 11-16 completed the Psychological Characteristics of Developing Excellence Questionnaire (PCDEQ) on 1-5 occasions. This combination of single and repeated assessments resulted in a mixed-longitudinal sample of 226 completed PCDEQs. Players were then prospectively tracked, and their scholarship status assessed at follow-up, at age U17. Multilevel modelling revealed that coping with performance and developmental pressures scores increased with age, and that Category 1-2 academy scholars (4.35 ± 0.61) scored higher than Category 3-4 academy scholars (3.99 ± 0.67) and non-scholars (4.02 ± 0.78) (p < .05). Evaluating performances and working on weaknesses scores increased with age for Category 1-2 academy scholars (U12-U14 vs. U15-U16 = 5.16 ± 0.48 vs. 5.38 ± 0.45), compared to non-scholars (U12-U14 vs. U15-U16 = 5.11 ± 0.59 vs. 5.03 ± 0.71) (p < .05). Imagery use during practice and competition scores decreased with age (U12-U14 vs. U15-U16 = 4.45 ± 0.66 vs. 4.29 ± 0.70) (p < .05). A blend of PCDEs may facilitate optimal career progression. Football academies should develop players' PCDEs, with a particular focus on developing their coping skills and their ability to realistically evaluate performances and work on weaknesses.","2019","2020-05-20 00:39:08","2020-05-20 00:39:08",NA,"1-7",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Medline",NA,NA,NA,"; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02640414.2019.1676526; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629578252","football player; human; human experiment; article; soccer; controlled study; prospective study; competition; follow up; questionnaire; juvenile; child; school child; multilevel analysis; age; career; imagery; coping behavior",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The aim of the study was to characterise the incidence and duration of upper respiratory illness in school boy (three tiers), amateur, and professional rugby players to assess the typical illness rates across different levels. Participants were asked to complete a questionnaire twice a week for the duration of the active playing season investigating level of activity, well-being, and respiratory-related symptoms. Upper respiratory illness incidence per 1000 non-sick days (± SD) for the three tiers of school boy (Under 14 s, n = 9; 2nd XV, n = 15; 1st XV, n = 24), amateur (n = 18), and professional (n = 24) teams was 11.1 ± 9.7, 11.0 ± 17.8, 22.4 ± 30.9, 12.2 ± 21.8, and 12.4 ± 16.8, respectively. In addition, the duration of illness was 62.3 ± 116.1, 59.6 ± 183.2, 552.1 ± 1138.8, 64.3 ± 173.9, and 32.6 ± 59.7 days per 1000 non-sick days, respectively. This is the first study reporting the respiratory illness rates in different levels of rugby. Overall, the highest incidence observed was in the top echelon of school boy rugby, and this study provides a platform for further robust observational and interventional investigation at this level and others.

Even worse, some coaches encourage athletes to conceal symptoms. If athletes and coaches knew that performance after a concussion drops significantly which may hurt the team, athletes may be more prone to report concussion symptoms. Methods: This is a case series of 3 NCAA Division I football players who did not report their concussions until a later time. The play in which the concussion occurred was identified via video review then the players' performance grades, as scored by their position coaches, were recorded both before and after the concussion. Grades from other games were obtained for further comparison. Results: Three injuries were identified and reviewed. The player in the first case had a pre-injury performance score of 76/100 with a post-injury score of 47/100. This was an absolute drop of 29 points for a relative decrease in his in-game performance by 38%. His grades for other games that year averaged 75/100 with a range of 63 to 82. The player in the second case had a pre-injury score of 100/100 with a post-injury score of 60/100. This was an absolute drop of 40 points or a 40% relative decrease in his in-game performance. His grades for other games rarely dropped below 90. The player in the third case had a pre-injury score of 67/100 and post-injury score of 43/100 for an absolute drop of 24 points or a 36% relative decrease in his in-game performance. In his one other game with significant playing time that year, he scored a 77/100. Conclusions: In this case series, we report 3 college football players who suffered concussions but did not immediately disclose their symptoms. As expected, each had a marked decrease in their performance grades after their concussion with a relative decrease of 36%, 38% and 40%, respectively, from their pre-injury grades. Significance: If the performance effect of a concussion can be quantified, athletes and coaches may change their mindset that a concussion can be ""played through."" This case series should serve as a first step in quantifying concussion effects on performance.","2019","2020-05-20 00:56:02","2020-05-20 00:56:02",NA,"132",NA,"2","29",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Embase",NA,NA,NA,"; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/JSM.0000000000000724; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629860430","conference abstract; football player; human; male; case report; clinical article; concussion; case study; videorecording; quantitative analysis",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The former mainly concern the applied technical aspect of the game, while the latter focus more on the conditional abilities associated with the game (strength, endurance and speed), biomechanics and energy recruitment mechanisms. As for the executive part, the qualitative aspects require a good degree of development of the technical-coordinative capacities, which are divided into literature in special coordination capacities and general coordination skills. In this study we will see how coordination is a component strongly linked to football, but above all to its qualitative aspects, through tests administered to a group of young soccer players.

Initially he suffered an anterior blow injury to his proximal tibial resulting in a hyperextension injury and was unable to finish the game. Pain was sharp and worsening, waxing and waning, 7/10 pain. No radiation or paresthesia. He denies any prior knee injury or pain. No significant alleviating factors noted. Athletic trainer recommended clinic follow up due to extension deficit and effusion at time of injury; however, patient and family did not present despite multiple attempts of contact. Patient presented 4 days later backat football practice with inability to extend knee as well as progressive effusion and soft tissue edema with an antalgic gait and was re-referred to clinic. Physical Exam: Left Knee: soft tissue swelling and effusion noted. Range of Motion: active and passive 15 degrees with extension, 100 degrees with flexion. Pain to palpation over the distal femur. Depression palpated and visualized along the distal femur. Significant guarding limiting exam. Strength is 51 with dorsiflexion and plantarflexion as well as 41 with knee extension and flexion due to pain. Sensation is intact to light touch throughout the lower extremity. 21 dorsalis pedis pulse and posterior tibial pulse. No cyanosis or mottling of the foot. No gross laxity with anterior-posterior drawer at 90 degrees seated or with varus or valgus stress at 30 degrees. Rest of knee maneuvers deferred due to pain. Differential Diagnosis: Bucket handle meniscus tear Patellar fracture Quadriceps tendon rupture Tibial plateau fracture Physis injury Test Results: X-ray of knee: left distal femoral Salter-Harris type II fracture with posterior displacement of distal femoral physis. Final Diagnosis: Posteriorly displaced Salter Harris type II fracture of the distal femoral physis. Discussion: Presentation of traumatic distal femoral pain has a varied differential. When combined with an athlete with open physis the differential also must include injury to these structures. Although rare, our case is an illustration of sequalae from a forced traumatic hyperextension injury to the knee. Evident effusion with extension deficit reinforced the importance of radiographic evaluation. Given the findings of fracture as well as displacement, reduction was required for our patient. Reduced physis injuries also carry a recommendation of fixation. Outcome: He was placed in a locked TROM at angle for comfort and made non-weight bearing. He was referred to the ER and underwent subsequent closed reduction of displaced Salter Harris II distal femur fracture. Two smooth percutaneous Steinmann pins were placed in cross fashion for fixation. He was placed in a long leg cast and made non-weightbearing for 6 weeks. Follow-up: Slow progression of weight bearing status based on post-surgical response. He will need continued monitoring with emphasis at the 6 month mark for leg length discrepancy. Return to play with non-displaced fracture can be around 12 to 14 weeks. However, with displaced fracture with interven-tional fixation return to play is indeterminant.","2019","2020-05-20 00:54:39","2020-05-20 00:54:39",NA,"e21",NA,"2","29",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Embase",NA,NA,NA,"; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/JSM.0000000000000728; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629860209","conference abstract; football player; human; male; case report; clinical article; follow up; child; school child; range of motion; knee meniscus rupture; clinical assessment; soft tissue; paresthesia; sensation; touch; stress; knee pain; foot; differential diagnosis; gait; X ray; weight bearing; athletic trainer; edema; palpation; leg length inequality; comfort; middle school; patella fracture; quadriceps tendon rupture; cyanosis; long leg cast; distal femur; closed reduction (procedure); tibial plateau fracture",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

From theoretical conception to practical design","Retos: Nuevas Perspectivas de Educación Física, Deporte y Recreación",NA,"15791726","",NA,"In recent years, we have identified a trend towards a change in the concepts and methodologies of soccer training. The traditional paradigm has given way to new proposals that understand the game from a holistic perspective. This break has led to the emergence of new ways of conceiving training. These training methods are close to each sport’s specificity. One of the methods that has raised more interest, due to its repercussions in professional soccer thanks to successful coaches, is the Tactical Periodization. This idea is based on the conception of game model as a fundamental element from which different game patterns grow, each of them needing to be reproduced later in the training. On account of a lack of practical proposals showing clear guidelines for the development of a game model, we try to present a personal design starting from i) a conceptual analysis of the game model, ii) the identification of the elements that this model needs to show, and iii) a practical development of each element, which serves as route map for those professionals who wish to delve into this training approach in soccer. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR En los últimos años hemos visto una tendencia hacia un cambio en los conceptos y metodologías de entrenamiento de fútbol. El paradigma tradicional ha dado paso a nuevas propuestas que entienden el juego desde un plano holístico. Esta ruptura ha supuesto la aparición de nuevas formas de concebir el entrenamiento, emergiendo métodos de entrenamiento que se acercan a la especificidad del deporte. A día de hoy, contamos con diversos métodos de trabajo, entre los cuales podríamos citar el microciclo estructurado y la periodización táctica como lo que mayor interés y repercusión han suscitado debido a su utilización por entrenadores de éxito. En este sentido, la periodización táctica se fundamenta en la concepción del modelo de juego como elemento fundamental de donde parten los diferentes patrones de juego que deben ser reproducidos posteriormente en el entrenamiento. Debido a la falta de propuesta prácticas que manifiesten pautas claras para el desarrollo de un modelo de juego, en este trabajo trataremos de llevar a cabo un diseño propio a partir de i) un análisis conceptual sobre el modelo de juego, ii) identificación de los elementos que este debe de contener y iii) desarrollo práctico de cada uno de los elementos que sirva como hoja de ruta para aquellos profesionales que quieran profundizar en esta forma de concebir el entrenamiento en fútbol.

P.","Association between community socioeconomic characteristics and access to youth flag football","Injury prevention : journal of the International Society for Child and Adolescent Injury Prevention",NA,"1475-5785","10.1136/injuryprev-2017-042677",NA,"BACKGROUND: The American Academy of Pediatrics has recommended that opportunities for non-tackling American football (e.g., flag football) be expanded, given concerns about the risks of brain trauma from tackle football. This study tested the hypothesis that flag football would be more accessible in communities characterised by higher socioeconomic status residents. METHODS: In July 2017, the locations of community-based organisations offering youth flag and tackle football for youth between the ages of 6 and 13 in two US states (Georgia and Washington) were aggregated (n=440). Organisations were coded in terms of the availability of tackle and/or flag football teams for youth at each year of age between 6 and 13. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to assess the odds of a community-based football organisation offering flag football, by community socioeconomic and demographic characteristics. RESULTS: In both states, communities with more educated residents were more likely to offer flag football for youth aged 6-12. For example, among 6 year-olds every 10% increase in the number of adult residents with a college education was associated with 1.51 times the odds of flag football availability (95% CI 1.22 to 1.86, P<0.001). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that youth living in communities characterised by low educational attainment are less likely than other youth to have the option of a lower contact alternative to tackle football. Relying on voluntary community-level adoption of lower contact alternatives to tackle football may result in inequitable access to such sport options. This may contribute to an inequitable burden of brain trauma from youth sport.","2019","2020-05-20 00:08:46","2020-05-20 00:08:46",NA,"278-282",NA,"4","25",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Medline",NA,NA,NA,"; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/injuryprev-2017-042677; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628818629","female; human; male; football; sport injury; injury; brain concussion; adolescent; child; classification; United States; access to information; attitude to health; health disparity; socioeconomics; traumatic brain injury; youth sport",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Chi-square and univariate general linear methods were used for the data analysis. Statistical difference is observed in the number of goals scored between the two halves (X²=8.699, p<0.005). A comparable percentage of scoring in most of the periods with the exceptions of the periods in overtime, the period from the 16th to 30th min, the additional time of the first and second half and the period from the 76th to 90th min of the game was determined (p<0.01). The teams that scored first won 71.4% matches, lost 9.5% and had a tie 19% of the matches (X²=42.000, p<0.001). Most of the goals were scored following a corner kick (24), penalty (22) and free kick scored non-directly (16), which were significantly different from free kick scored directly (6) and throw in (2) (X²=26.857, p<0.001). 19 goals were scored from cross, 19 from a long-range shot (8 of them with the ""inner foot""), 18 from a forward pass and 12 from cutback.

The aim was to determine differences in the sport psychological skill levels of African junior soccer players of different maturation levels. Male football players (N = 149) with a mean age of 16.24 ± 1.10 years participated in this study. Based on a synthesis of previous research a biological maturation questionnaire was used to classify the participants as EDs (n = 27), ADs (n = 77), and LDs (n = 45). The Athletic Coping Skills Inventory-28 was used to measure their sport psychological skills. The LDs had significantly higher coping with adversity (p = .032, d = 0.35), as well as goal setting and mental preparation (p = . 014, d = 0.76) scores than the EDs. Psychological factors could potentially have counterbalanced some of the physical disadvantages of late maturation. Coaches, selectors and talent scouts should be careful not to exclude later maturing soccer players from talent development programmes.

RSNM enables personalized targeting of focal neuromodulation techniques such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). rTMS is believed to exert antidepressant efficacy by modulating connectivity between the stimulation site, the default mode network (DMN), and the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC). Personalized rTMS may be particularly useful after repetitive traumatic brain injury (TBI), which is associated with neurodegenerative tauo-pathy in medial temporal limbic structures. These degenerative changes are believed to be related to treatment-resistant neurobehavioral disturbances observed in many retired athletes. Methods: The authors describe a case in which RSNM was successfully used to target rTMS to treat these neuropsychiatric disturbances in a retired NFL defensive lineman whose symptoms were not responsive to conventional treatments. RSNM was used to identify left-right dorsolateral prefrontal rTMS targets with maximal difference between dorsal attention network and DMN correlations. These targets were spatially distinct from those identified by prior methods. Twenty sessions of left-sided excitatory and right-sided inhibitory rTMS were administered at these targets. Results: Treatment led to improvement in Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (72%), cognitive testing, and headache scales scores. Compared with healthy individuals and subjects with TBI-associated depression, baseline rsfMRI revealed substantially elevated DMN connectivity with the medial temporal lobe (MTL). Serial rsfMRI scans revealed gradual improvement in MTL-DMN connectivity and stimulation site connectivity with sgACC. Conclusions: These results highlight the possibility of individualized neuromodulation and biomarker-based monitoring for neuropsychiatric sequelae of repetitive TBI.","2019","2020-05-20 00:26:37","2020-05-20 00:26:37",NA,"254-263",NA,"3","31",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Embase Medline",NA,NA,NA,"; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1176/appi.neuropsych.18100230; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002254954","adult; football player; human; male; article; case report; clinical article; priority journal; controlled study; cognition; traumatic brain injury; depression; headache; mental disease; functional magnetic resonance imaging; treatment outcome; anterior cingulate; brain mapping; connectome; default mode network; dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; medial temporal lobe; Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale; repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation; resting state network mapping",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

For the technical-tactical and conditional tests, WIMU devices were used. These devices include different sensors, as GPS, accelerometer and heart rate. For the sports engagement tests players completed a questionnaire. From the tactical point of view, findings show that there are higher areas of play and relationships, and interactions between players / teams with greater distances, in the 8-a-side soccer format. From the conditional point of view, 7-a-side soccer is somewhat more demanding than 8-a-side soccer, since it presents more prolonged and more intense efforts. Both formats have shown that we are facing an intermittent sports practice, where most of their efforts are made at medium or high intensity, with physical (m•min-1) and physiological (% HRmax) values that approximate the adult format of 11-a-side soccer.

Injuries to players can result in missed games1, impaired athletic performance, psychological effects2, a decline in player trade value, and lost revenue. The purpose of this study was to characterize oral and maxillofacial injuries in professional athletes of 4 major sports leagues. Materials and Methods: The Pro Sports Transaction Archive was searched for movement of players to and from injury lists between the start and end dates of the 2017–2018 season for professional basketball (NBA), football (NFL), baseball (MLB), and hockey (NHL). Injuries related to the head were included and grouped by lower face (mandible), midface (maxilla, zygoma, nose, orbits), and upper face (frontal). Predictor variables were sports league and injury location. Outcome variables were frequency and duration on injury list. Association between variables was assessed with chi-squared and analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests. Results and Outcomes Data: A total of 33 oral and maxillofacial injuries were identified (10 NBA, 2 NFL, 2 MLB, 19 NHL). The most common injury location was midface (23/33; 70%), followed by lower face (7/33; 21%) and upper face (3/33; 9%). There was no significant association between sports league and injury location (P =.663). The mean time on the injury list was 10.8 days ± 11.3 days (11.6 ± 16.3 days NBA, 16.0 ± 7.0 days NFL, 8.0 ± 0.0 days MLB, 9.8 ± 8.7 days NHL). There was no significant association between sports league and injury duration (P =.769). Although lower face injuries had longer duration (13.8 ± 14.5 days) than midface (10.6 ± 11.2 days) and upper face (5.0 ± 2.8 days) injuries, the difference was not significant (P =.659). Five injuries were season-ending (1 NBA, 1 MLB, 3 NHL). Conclusion: Oral and maxillofacial injuries were responsible for missed games in the NBA, NFL, MLB, and NHL. Despite the use of helmets, the NHL experienced the greatest number of facial injuries. Midface injuries had the highest incidence in all 4 leagues and lower face injuries had the longest recovery period. Future studies should investigate multiple seasons and longitudinal patterns to identify trends in injury frequencies. References: 1.

METHODS: Ten well-trained, male soccer athletes randomly completed 3 trials: work-to-rest ratio (SEPT) 1:5, SEPT/1:8, and a control trial. Training load during SEPT was monitored using global positioning system and heart-rate monitors. Performance (isokinetic strength of knee extensors and flexors, speed, and countermovement jump) and muscle damage (delayed-onset muscle soreness [DOMS] and creatine kinase) were evaluated at baseline and at 0, 24, 48 and 72 h posttraining. Maximal voluntary contraction (fatigue index) of knee extensors and flexors was additionally assessed at 1, 2, and 3 h posttraining. RESULTS: Fatigue increased (P < .05) in SEPT/1:5 (∼4-30%) for 3 h and in SEPT/1:8 (∼8-17%) for 2 h. Strength performance declined (P < .05) in both SEPT trials (∼5-20%) for 48 h. Speed decreased (∼4-18%; P < .05) for 72 h in SEPT/1:5 and for 48 h in SEPT/1:8. Countermovement-jump performance decreased (∼7-12%; P < .05) in both SEPT trials for 24 h. DOMS increased (P < .05) in SEPT/1:5 (∼2-fold) for 72 and in SEPT/1:8 (∼1- to 2-fold) for 48 h. Creatine kinase increased (∼1- to 2-fold, P < .05) in both SEPT trials for 72 h. CONCLUSIONS: SEPT induces short-term neuromuscular fatigue; provokes a prolonged deterioration of strength (48 h), speed (72 h), and jump performance (24 h); and is associated with a prolonged (72-h) rise of DOMS and creatine kinase. Time for recovery is reduced when longer work-to-rest ratios are applied.

Design: Descriptive, observational. Methods: Twenty-nine international women's rugby union players wore 10 Hz microelectromechanical systems during eight international matches (110 observations). Total, and per-half, distances were recorded, whilst relative total and high-speed (>4.4 m s−1) distances were averaged using FIXED and ROLL methods over 60–600-s. Linear mixed models compared distances covered between match halves, assessed FIXED versus ROLL, and examined the influence of playing position. Results: Players covered ∼5.8 km match−1, with reduced distances in the second- versus first-half (p < 0.001). For worst-case scenario total (∼8–25%) and high-speed (∼10–26%) distance, FIXED underestimated ROLL. In ROLL, worst-case scenario relative total and high-speed distances reduced from ∼144−161 m min−1 and ∼30−69 m min−1 over 60-s, to ∼80 89 m min−1 and ∼5 16 m min−1 in the 600-s epoch, respectively. Forwards performed less high-speed running over all epochs and covered less total distance during epochs of 60-s, 180-s, 420-s and 480-s, compared with backs. Front row players typically returned the lowest locomotor demands. Conclusions: This is the first study reporting the positional and worst-case scenario demands of international women's rugby union, and indicates an underestimation in FIXED versus ROLL over 60-s to 600-s epochs. Knowledge of the most demanding periods of women's rugby union match-play facilitates training specificity by enabling sessions to be tailored to such demands.","2019","2020-05-20 00:08:35","2020-05-20 00:08:35",NA,"",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Embase Medline",NA,NA,NA,"; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsams.2019.12.016; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2004369303","adult; female; human; human experiment; article; rugby; clinical article; controlled study; team sport; running; velocity; fatigue; microelectromechanical system",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

A further objective was to identify and present features distinguishing between the activities of players within the Defender, Midfielder and Forward formations. The study sample comprised 4426 individual match observations of 473 soccer players competing in the Bundesliga during the 2016/2017 domestic season. Data from the Impire AG motion analysis system, and the so-called ""heat maps"" it supplies, revealed areas in which players spent most time during a match, with 22 different playing positions on the pitch identified in consequence. Players in the formation comprising Defenders did not differ significantly in relation to the number of accelerations, the number of shots or the percentage of duels won. Furthermore, there were no significant differences among Midfielders in regard to total distance covered, mean running speed, the number of accelerations, the number of duels and the percentage of duels won. Likewise, Forwards did not differ in distances covered at ≥24 km/h, average running speed, the number of sprints, the number of shots, the proportion of on-target passes, the number of duels, or the percentage share of duels won. Irrespective of the formation or position on the pitch, today's game of soccer also pays great importance to the number of accelerations, as well as the number of duels engaged in, and their effectiveness.

A similar lack of succession benefits has been reported in studies of manager and CEO succession: it has not been established that changing a team's leader improves a declining team's performance. We study the effect of a change of coach on the performance of a professional soccer team. Based on rarely obtained access to a whole season (one year) of daily close observation of the team and coaching staff in practice and matches, this study uses quantitative and qualitative data to go beyond the “average” pattern reported in the literature. We document in detail how, in a single team case study over an entire season, the processes in leadership behavior changed with a change of coach, the effect this had on the state of mind of the team, how the match behaviors of the players changed, and how these changes translated into improved performance. The process effects of a leadership change on the performance of a sports team may hold insights for leader succession in management: in addition to the aggregate organizational and experience fit of the new team leader, the specific leadership processes introduced by the new leader are critical for performance effects.","2019","2020-05-20 00:30:43","2020-05-20 00:30:43",NA,"",NA,"3","14",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Embase Medline",NA,NA,NA,"; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0212634; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2001700748","human; article; soccer; season; leadership; staff",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Unfortunately, these methods of measurement are time-consuming, invasive, and costly. A quick noninvasive measurement tool is needed to aid studies of head injury and its biological impact. Quantitative pupillometry is a potential objective, rapid, noninvasive measurement tool that may be used to assess the neurological effects of HHIs. In this study, the authors investigated the effect of HHIs on pupillary metrics, as measured using a pupillometer, in the absence of a diagnosed concussion. METHODS: A prospective observational cohort study involving 18 high school football athletes was performed. These athletes were monitored for both the frequency and magnitude of head impacts that they sustained throughout a playing season by using the Head Impact Telemetry System. An HHI was defined as an impact exceeding 95g linear acceleration and 3760 rad/sec2 rotational acceleration. Pupillary assessments were performed at baseline, midseason, after occurrence of an HHI, and at the end of the season by using the NeurOptics NPi-200 pupillometer. The Sport Concussion Assessment Tool, 5th Edition (SCAT5), was also used at each time point. Comparisons of data obtained at the various time points were calculated using a repeated-measures analysis of variance and a t-test. RESULTS: Seven athletes sustained HHIs without a related diagnosed concussion. Following these HHIs, the athletes demonstrated decreases in pupil dilation velocity (mean difference 0.139 mm/sec; p = 0.048), percent change in pupil diameter (mean difference 3.643%; p = 0.002), and maximum constriction velocity (mean difference 0.744 mm/sec; p = 0.010), compared to measurements obtained at the athletes' own midseason evaluations. No significant changes occurred between the SCAT5 subtest scores calculated at midseason and those after a high impact, although the effect sizes (Cohen's d) on individual components ranged from 0.41 to 0.65. CONCLUSIONS: Measurable changes in pupil response were demonstrated following an HHI. These results suggest that clinically asymptomatic HHIs may affect brain reflex pathways, reflecting a biological injury previously seen when more invasive methods were applied.","2019","2020-05-20 00:39:17","2020-05-20 00:39:17",NA,"1-6",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Medline",NA,NA,NA,"; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.3171/2019.7.JNS191272; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629993646","human; article; football; acceleration; prospective study; season; accelerometry; analysis of variance; athlete; cohort analysis; concussion; high school; effect size; quantitative analysis; reflex; axonal injury; chronic traumatic encephalopathy; telemetry; pupillometer; pupillometry; signal transduction; protein kinase p60; pediatrics; mydriasis; non invasive measurement",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

A total of 8 tactical dimensions related to the start, development and the end of the team possessions were evaluted by means of multidimensional observation. Kruskal Wallis analyses revealed significant tactical differences between the 4 competitions. SLL showed a greater proportion of long and combinative attacks. EPL had a higher tendency of progressing by means of fast and directs attacks. GB had the greatest number of counter-attacks, and ISA had the shortest offensive sequences and more proportion of counter-attacks and direct attacks than combinative and fast attacks.

METHODS: High school and collegiate football players (n = 857) were prospectively enrolled. Forty-one athletes with concussion and 43 matched control athletes met inclusion criteria. Serum levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor, C-reactive protein, interferon-γ, and IL-1 receptor antagonist and Sport Concussion Assessment Tool, 3rd edition (SCAT3) symptom severity scores were collected at a preinjury baseline, 6 and 24-48 hours postinjury, and approximately 8, 15, and 45 days following concussion. The number of days that athletes were symptomatic following SRC (i.e., duration of symptoms) was the primary outcome variable. RESULTS: IL-6 and IL-1RA were significantly elevated in athletes with concussion at 6 hours relative to preinjury and other postinjury visits, as well as compared to controls (ps ≤ 0.001). IL-6 and IL-1RA significantly discriminated concussed from control athletes at 6 hours postconcussion (IL-6 area under receiver operating characteristic curve 0.79 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.65-0.92], IL-1RA AUC 0.79 [95% CI 0.67-0.90]). Further, IL-6 levels at 6 hours postconcussion were significantly associated with the duration of symptoms (hazard ratio for symptom recovery = 0.61 [95% CI 0.38-0.96], p = 0.031). CONCLUSIONS: Results support the potential utility of IL-6 and IL-1RA as serum biomarkers of SRC and demonstrate the potential of these markers in identifying athletes at risk for prolonged recovery after SRC.

Background Sports concussion has been in the public eye and has been associated with heightened fear concerning playing football and other collision based sports. Protecting from concussion and rehabilitating the brain after a concussion is a high priority for many sports medical practitioners as well as for athletes wanting to play. For these reasons researchers associated with the American Athletic Conference (AAC) have been monitoring concussion incidence in football. Design/Methods The 12 schools of the AAC were surveyed for 2014, 2015, and 2016 concerning football induced concussions. Results The average seasonal concussion rate was 10.4 ± 1.02 concussions per year and average RTP time was 13.2 ± 1.21 days. In the one team where there was an aggressive neuro visual conditioning and rehabilitation post-concussion program employed the concussion rate was 3.0 ± 1.0 concussions per year and the RTP time was 6.5 ± 0.5 days. Both numbers are significantly lower than in the other AAC teams. Conclusions The current paper reports that there may be mitigation strategies that can be employed to decrease concussion incidence as well as aid in faster RTP times.

Whole-body electrostimulation (WB-EMS) has been shown to improve maximum strength, sprinting and jumping performance, and to increase deformability in elite soccer players during the season. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether WB-EMS affects RBC turnover which might affect overall deformability of circulating RBC by rejuvenation of the RBC population and if this might be related to improved endurance capacity. Thirty male field soccer players were assigned in either a WB-EMS group (EG, n = 10), a training group (TG, n = 10), or a control group (CG, n = 10). EG performed 3 × 10 squat jumps superimposed with WB-EMS twice per week in concurrent to 2-4 soccer training sessions and one match per week. TG only performed 3 × 10 squat jumps without EMS in addition to their soccer routine and the CG only performed the usual soccer training and match per week. Subjects were tested before (Baseline) and in week 7 (wk-7), with blood sampling before (Pre), 15-30 min after (Post), and 24 h after (24 h post) the training. Endurance capacity was determined before and directly after the training period. The key findings of the investigation indicate an increase in young RBC in the EG group along with improved overall RBC deformability, represented by decreased SS1/2:EImax Ratio. Analysis of the different RBC subfractions revealed improved RBC deformability of old RBC during study period. This improvement was not only observed in the EG but also in TG and CG. Changes in RBC deformability were not associated to altered RBC-NOS/NO signaling pathway. Endurance capacity remained unchanged during study period. In summary, the effect of WB-EMS on RBC physiology seems to be rather low and results are only in part comparable to previous findings. According to the lower training volume of the present study it can be speculated that the soccer specific training load in addition to the WB-EMS was too low to induce changes in RBC physiology.","2019","2020-05-20 00:27:08","2020-05-20 00:27:08",NA,"",NA,"MAY","10",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Embase",NA,NA,NA,"; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2019.00548; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628303754","adult; human; human experiment; male; article; soccer player; controlled study; blood sampling; normal human; endurance; jumping; human cell; erythrocyte count; electrostimulation; cell density; cell separation; erythrocyte deformability; erythrocyte lifespan; nitric oxide; nitric oxide synthase; whole body electrostimulation",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In the absence of baseline assessment, only norm values of the general population are available for comparison with scores of concussed athletes. To evaluate whether (elite) sport specific norm values are needed, cognitive performance was compared between top-level football players and the general population. METHODS: Cognitive performance of 425 top-level football players was evaluated using the computerized test battery CNS Vital Signs. Players were split into two age groups (15-19 and 20-29 years) and test results were compared with a norm sample (n = 268) by means of age-standardized scores using Cohen's d effect size statistics. RESULTS: The younger age group outperformed the norm sample in all domains, with small to moderate effects on tests of processing speed (d = 0.58, 95% CI = 0.31,0.85), cognitive flexibility (d = 0.27, 95% CI = 0.01,0.53) and psychomotor speed (d = 0.97, 95% CI = 0.69,1.24). In the older age group, no differences were found on four out of six domains; a moderate positive effect was found for psychomotor speed (d = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.54,0.93), a small negative effect for reaction time (d = -0.47, 95% CI = -0.66,-0.28). Relative to the norm, older football players scored lower than younger football players on all test domains. CONCLUSION: Cognitive performance of elite football players may be different from the general population. It is recommended to use football-specific norm scores for comparison with test results of concussed players, and to choose an adequate control group when investigating effects of contact sport on cognition. Studies with older/retired football players are needed to further analyze potential sport-specific age effects.","2019","2020-05-20 00:32:49","2020-05-20 00:32:49",NA,"575-584",NA,"4","34",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Medline",NA,NA,NA,"; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/arclin/acy056; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L627765435","adult; female; human; male; football; adolescent; athlete; young adult; psychology; cognition; age; reaction time; psychomotor performance; reference value; neuropsychological test",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Recovery is required to maximize training and competition performance; fatigue should be minimized by recovering as fast as possible. This study aimed to assess effects of contrast water therapy on blood lactate concentration after high-intensity interval training (HiiT) in elite futsal players. Methods. A total of 30 male futsal athletes volunteered to be subjects in this study. The test session consisted of repeated sprints at the distance of 25 m (3 series of two 1-min repetitions at 90% of maximum heart rate). After HiiT, the participants were randomized into 2 groups; 15 received contrast water therapy (CWT), and 15 were given slow jogging recovery (SJR). The recovery for the CWT group consisted of periodic immersions in cold water (18°C) for 1 min and then in hot water (37°C) for 2 min, with accumulating 15 min in the water. The recovery for the SJR group included 8 min of slow jogging (6.8 km · h−1) around a field. Results. After 30-min recovery, lactate concentration was significantly greater (p = 0.001) in the SJR group (7.67 mmol/l) than in the CWT group (6.82 mmol/l) and remained significantly different 60 min after recovery (p = 0.0001; 6.80 mmol/l and 5.01 mmol/l, respectively).

In this study, the authors examine the market disruption of college football protests, under the belief the ability of market disruption can play a significant role for activism movements to challenge authority as well as expand opportunity for social change. Specifically considering game attendance as an important form of market demand, the authors employ regression modeling to analyze the relationship between game attendance and protests organized to struggle against racial injustices by football players at four Division I Football Bowl Subdivision programs. The results from the empirical models suggest that the voting demographics of the local market a team plays in have a significant relationship with attendance after a protest, with some schools experiencing declines in consumer interest. Results advance the current inquiry of athlete activism through an economic lens, which contributes to further discussions on the empowerment of athletes and their roles in social activism.

Occupational stress involved in sports officiating is so high that officials ranked closely behind air traffic controllers, inner city teachers, and police officers when it comes to most stressful jobs. Nevertheless, referees are only human, and mistakes will be made; however, these errors are often under intense scrutiny. Referees in Australian Football League (AFL) face a difficult task when compared to their counterparts from other sports due to the absence of a no “off-side” rule. Experiencing high levels of stress while refereeing could lead to negative psychological and somatic effects on the referees’ health ranging from decreased satisfaction to various levels of burnout. Examples of stress among referees include verbal abuse from coaches, athletes and spectators, making a controversial call, lack of recognition, poor performance, interpersonal conflict, and time pressure. Methods: Seventy-two umpires, with 1–26 years of experience umpiring AFL games completed the online survey at the start of the 2019 AFL season. Umpires completed the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ), the 21-item version of the depression, anxiety, and stress scale (DASS), and the 22-item Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI). The wording of some of the MBI items was modified to reflect the specific working circumstances of the umpiring community. Results: The three MBI scales of emotional exhaustion, personal accomplishment, and depersonalisation were used in multiple linear regression analyses to predict scores on the DASS scales, as well as the total GHQ. Depersonalisation was not a significant predictor in any of the analyses (p >.33); however, emotional exhaustion significantly predicted all outcome measures, explaining 15% of the variability in depression (p =.001), 11 % in anxiety (p =.003), 5% in stress (p = 042), and 10% in GHQ scores (p =.005). Personal accomplishment also significantly contributed to 5% and 12% of variability in depression (p =.047) and stress (p =.003), respectively. Discussion: The findings corroborate earlier work with AFL coaches in that indices of job burnout, particularly emotional exhaustion, significantly predict psychological distress. Emotional exhaustion also appears to play a crucial role in the general well-being of umpires. These results are in line with the recurrent findings that football industry employees may feel exhausted and overextended due to constant scrutiny from players, management, and the fans. It is, therefore, imperative to implement strategies to enhance work-life balance in umpires.","2019","2020-05-20 00:58:19","2020-05-20 00:58:19",NA,"S50",NA,"","22",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Embase",NA,NA,NA,"; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsams.2019.08.236; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002914908","conference abstract; human; football; controlled study; season; athlete; outcome assessment; anxiety; satisfaction; work-life balance; wellbeing; General Health Questionnaire; burnout; mental stress; employee; depersonalization; Depression Anxiety Stress Scale; emotional stress; conflict; verbal hostility",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Methods: 12 young professional players performed three types of soccer-specific exercise: one small-sided game (SSG) and two soccer-specific training (SST: repeated sprints and aerobic runs). Each type of exercise was performed twice, at low and high training volume. Acute and delayed sessions' effects were assessed by changes in exercise heart-rate (HR) and blood lactate, counter-movement jumps (CMJ), speed and distance achieved during a final game performed after the soccer-specific exercises. Results: In SSG, the volume increase enhanced the time spent in the highest HR zone (P=0.027) and blood lactate concentration (P=0.018). Speed and distance achieved in the final game were lower after SSG than after aerobic-SST exercise (P<0.05). The next morning CMJ decreased after SST exercises (P<0.001). Sessions' HR was correlated with running distance (r=0.65, P=0.006) and the next morning changes in sprint density was correlated with CMJ performance (r=0.56, P=0.01).

Whilst deficits in trunk and hip muscle function associated with low back pain have been demonstrated in elite male Australian football and soccer players, little is known about this relationship in female Australian football players. This exploratory study aimed to examine the size and function of trunk and hip muscles in elite female AFL players with and without low back pain. Methods: Twelve female players from a professional AFL club participated in this cross-sectional study. In the preseason, presence and history of low back pain, including duration of symptoms, was assessed using questionnaires. Presence of recent low back pain was established using a rating of pain intensity for the past week on a visual analogue scale. Size and function of the trunk and hip muscles were assessed with ultrasound imaging using previously published protocols. Independent-samples t-tests were conducted to compare muscle size and function between players with and without low back pain. Significance was set at p < 0.10. Results: 58 % of players reported low back pain in the last week with an average rating of pain intensity of 4.9 (2.1) cm and an average duration of 9.6 (6.8) weeks. In players with low back pain, size of the multifidus muscle at L5 was smaller on the kicking leg (p = 0.007) and the gluteus medius muscle was smaller on the stance leg (p = 0.059). Low back pain was associated with increased contraction of the multifidus muscle at L5 (p = 0.02) and decreased contraction of the internal oblique muscle on the stance leg (p = 0.001). Discussion: Similar to results of previous research on male football players, deficits in trunk and hip muscle size and altered function were found in female football players with low back pain. These preliminary findings may be important as a previous prospective study of 259 elite male AFL players showed that players with recent low back pain and players with a smaller multifidus muscle on the kicking leg had higher odds of sustaining a lower limb injury. As the reported changes in lumbopelvic muscle function have been shown to be amenable to intervention in elite male football players, further research aimed at identification of modifiable factors in female football players with low back pain may be warranted.","2019","2020-05-20 00:59:31","2020-05-20 00:59:31",NA,"S96",NA,"","22",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Embase",NA,NA,NA,"; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsams.2019.08.120; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002901976","adult; conference abstract; female; football player; human; male; injury; controlled study; prospective study; questionnaire; cross-sectional study; muscle function; leg; multifidus muscle; muscle mass; trunk; ultrasound; visual analog scale; hip muscle; standing; exploratory research; gluteus medius muscle; low back pain; oblique internal abdominal muscle; pain intensity",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

A test was run in order to show how the GoMeSy platform could be used by coaches to evaluate the penalty shot-stopping skills of goalkeepers, consequently, the performance of 22 players was measured. In the case of the cognitive skills, there is not a significant difference between novice and expert goalkeepers (p = 0.333), meanwhile, in the case of the motor skills, there is a significant difference (p = 0.006). In addition, there is a moderate, positive correlation between weight and motion time (r = 0.437). In general, this study demonstrates that the GoMeSy platform allows coaches to evaluate with accuracy the penalty shot-stopping skills of goalkeepers. The findings of the test emphasize the fact that coaches do not have to focus only on the goalkeepers' physical training (motor skills), but they should also consider developing the reaction time (cognitive skills). The results also highlight that although the body mass index depends on the height and weight of each subject, coaches should focus primarily on monitoring the weight of players to improve their performance.

At the game, he presented to the athletic trainer and physician with hemoptysis. No neck pain was reported. Plain films were negative for rib fracture or pulmonary contusion. Approximately 1 week later, he woke up with mild pain in the base of his skull that radiated to his left ear. Pain progressed over the next several days, which prevented him from returning to practice. There was pain with neck flexion and a catching sensation when extending back to neutral. Symptoms were worse in the morning and aggravatedby coughing or sneezing. He denied weakness, numbness, tingling, headache, dizziness or tinnitus. When his symptoms failed to resolve after = days-2 weeks after the initial injury - he presented to ED. Physical Exam: General: Alert and oriented with no acute distress. MSK: Decreased range of motion of cervical spine with flexion, extension, lateral rotation and side bend. Neuro: Cranial Nerves II-XII intact. Sensation to light touch intact in bilateral upper and lower extremities. 5/5 strength in bilateral deltoids, biceps, triceps. 5/5 strength with bilateral wrist flexion, wrist extension and gripping. 5/5 strength with bilateral hip flexion, knee extension, ankle dorsiflexion and plantar flexion. 21 reflexes in bilateral biceps and brachior-adialis. 11 reflexes in bilateral patellar tendons. Coordination intact with finger-to-nose testing. Differential Diagnosis: Cervical disc herniation Cervical spinal cord compression Atlantoaxial ligamentous injury Cervical vertebral body fracture Cervical facet displacement Test Results: CT C-Spine: Subluxation of C1 in relation to C2, atlantodental interval (ADI) 4.5 mm (wide), anterior positioning of posterior C1 arch narrows canal at C1. High density material in L. ventral epidural space posterior to C2 vertebral body. MRI C-Spine: Injury to the R. alar, transverse and posterior interspinous ligaments at C1-C2. Large L. paracentral disc herniation at C2-C3 with associated cord impingement and flattening. DynamicXR C-Spine: ADI 4mm in flexion, 2 mm in extension. Final Diagnosis: (1) Ligamentous injury involving right alar ligament, transverse ligament and posterior interspinous ligament at C1-C2. (2) Left disc extrusion at C2-C3. Discussion: The craniocervical junction (CCJ) is stabilized by several ligaments, the strongest ofwhich include the transverse and alar ligaments. Injury to these ligaments can result in CCJ instability. The athlete also sustained a C2-C3 disc extrusion, causing cord impingement. Herniation at this level is rare, especially in young patients. High c-spine instability and herniation can result in paralysis and cardiorespiratory compromise, so prompt diagnosis is key. CT and dynamic XR can assess for C1-C2 stability. MRI can evaluate for spinal cord pathology. Immediate c-spine immobilization is imperative. The degree of stability and cord injury determine whether management is surgical or conservative. Outcome: The patient was admitted to observation for neurosurgical evaluation after initial CT and MRI were concerning for possible atlantoaxial instability. However, flexion and extension plain films ruled out gross instability. Therefore, he was treated non-operatively and placed in a cervical collar, which was to be worn at all times. Follow-up: The patient returned for follow-up neurosurgical evaluation 2 weeks after being placed in the collar. He reported complete resolution of neck pain and continued to deny any neurologic symptoms. The follow up plain films showed loss of normal lordosis; however, no further C1-C2 subluxation was noted on neutral lateral x-ray. Conservative management with cervical collar was continued on discharge.","2019","2020-05-20 00:56:05","2020-05-20 00:56:05",NA,"e31-e32",NA,"2","29",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Embase",NA,NA,NA,"; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/JSM.0000000000000728; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629860380","adult; conference abstract; female; football player; human; male; rib fracture; case report; hip; knee; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; biceps brachii muscle; clinical article; thorax; young adult; follow up; patellar ligament; outcome assessment; ankle; range of motion; rotation; physician; physical examination; remission; dizziness; wrist; cranial nerve; hypesthesia; sensation; touch; diagnosis; differential diagnosis; X ray; headache; neck pain; weakness; conservative treatment; athletic trainer; cervical disk hernia; compression; ligament injury; lordosis; deltoid muscle; subluxation; finger; cervical collar; triceps brachii muscle; paralysis; distress syndrome; vertebra body; nose; cervical spinal cord; coughing; epidural space; hemoptysis; immobilization; lung contusion; skull; sneezing; spinal cord disease; tinnitus",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

She reported that she braced herself for a tackle during a contact drill in practice when she experienced sharp pain near the left shoulder blade. She reported pain in the medial periscapular area with shoulder movement and deep inspiration. After initial negative imaging, she did trials of NSAIDs, muscle relaxants and tramadol as well as physical therapy, myofascial manual therapy, trigger point injections and chiropractic manipulation over the course of 6 months without significant improvement. The last 3 of those months, she was home in Canada for summer break. The athlete now returns to campus with continued pain. Physical Exam: Well appearing female. No obvious abnormalities or gross asymmetry of left back or shoulder. Slightly kyphotic posture. Cervical spine range of motion is full. No midline tenderness. Painful Spurling's, without radiation. Non-tender thoracic spine. Tenderness to the lower border of the upper trapezius, left rhomboid and levator scapulae. Mild deficit with shoulder flexion and abduction secondary to pain. Strength = 5/5. Non-painful AP and lateral compression of rib cage. Differential Diagnosis: Rhomboid spasm Scapular dyskinesis Thoracoscapular bursitis or snapping scapula Posterior rib fracture Thoracic transverse process fracture Test Results: T-Spine and Left Rib XR (April 2017) normal. T-Spine MRI (August 2017) Healing left posterior third rib fracture near transverse process. Vitamin D level = 66 ng/mL. CT Chest (December 2017) Partial nonunion of above fracture. (CT performed due to continued pain despite activity limitation). Bone Scan (March 2018) Small focus of radiotracer uptake over posterior left third rib. (Obtained to assess fracture healing). Follow up CT Chest (September 2018) Interval healing of the fracture. Final Diagnosis: Isolated fracture of the left posterior third rib. Discussion: Isolated posterior rib fractures immediately adjacent to the transverse process are unusual in the absence of high velocity trauma and other injuries. It is suspected that fracture healing was impaired by the combination of manipulation and an inability to immobilize the costotrans-verse joint. Other cases of isolated posterior rib fractures were not found in the literature to guide decision-making. Despite a normal vitamin D level, the athlete continued calcium and vitamin D supplements. A bone stimulator was used to facilitate fracture healing based on the success of stimulators in other fracture non-unions. The bone stimulator was used for = months, which likely played a role in healing. Outcome: The athlete was restricted from contact and heavy upper extremity lifting activities for 18 months due to recurrent pain with attempts to progress back to contact activities. Follow-up: After the significant period of rest, the athlete was able to slowly start back with modified upper body lifting without recurrence of pain. She does not plan to return to competitive rugby at this time.","2019","2020-05-20 00:39:19","2020-05-20 00:39:19",NA,"e11-e12",NA,"2","29",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Embase",NA,NA,NA,"; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/JSM.0000000000000728; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629860524","adult; conference abstract; female; human; rib fracture; rugby; case report; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; clinical article; athlete; young adult; follow up; decision making; summer; abduction; range of motion; cervical spine; physiotherapy; physical examination; pain; calcium; vitamin D; thoracic spine; diagnosis; differential diagnosis; tracer; compression; muscle spasm; Canada; body position; scapula; relapse; bone scintiscanning; dyskinesia; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; bone growth stimulator; bursitis; chiropractic manipulation; levator scapulae muscle; pseudarthrosis; rib cage; tramadol; transverse process; trapezius muscle; trigger point",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Despite the growing support for GBAs in the academic literature, evidence is currently lacking regarding the application of GBAs across different sports and developmental levels. Accordingly, the present study aimed to investigate Gaelic football coaches' self-reported practice activities and session sequencing and assess how these aligned with benchmarks outlined in the GBA academic literature. In addition, coaches' practice activities were examined as a function of developmental level (academy/developmental/senior) and time of the season (pre/peak). Responses to an online survey, completed by 150 practicing inter-county Gaelic football coaches, were analysed. During pre-season, coaches estimated spending the majority of time in Training Form activities (e.g., isolated fitness, technical skill), whereas they predominately utilised Playing Form activities (e.g., modified games) during peak-season. Coaches reported utilising Training Form activities in the first half of their coaching session before progressing to game like activities in the second half of the session. Few differences were noted across developmental levels. Further education with Gaelic football coaches is required to ensure a more sophisticated conceptual understanding and application of GBAs in coaches' practice.

This study examines concussion effects on individual players in the Major League Soccer (MLS) and English Premier League (EPL) by assessing 1) return-to-play (RTP) time, 2) career length, and 3) performance. Methods: Contracts, transactions, injury reports, and performance statistics from 2008-17 were obtained from the official MLS and EPL online publications. Players who sustained a concussion were compared with the 2008-17 non-concussed player pool. Career length was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and athletes were stratified by player age, experience, and longevity. Player performance changes were evaluated between the years before versus after concussion. RTP and games missed were analyzed and compared. Results: Of the 1,784 eligible MLS and 2,001 eligible EPL players evaluated over the 10-year period, 102 MLS players sustained 165 concussions and 124 EPL players sustained 142 concussions resulting in injury protocol initiation. MLS players on average missed 7.5 games after a concussion, with 33.5 days missed, whereas EPL players on average missed 0.5 games after a concussion with 9.5 days missed, which was statistically different (p<0.001, p<0.0001). Performance was reduced at all non-goalie positions for goals and assists post-concussion for players in the MLS and in the EPL (p < 0.01). Concussed MLS players playing non-goalie positions scored 2.5 points/year less following a concussion and played in 20 fewer games/year on average. Concussed EPL players playing non-goalie positions scored 3.1 points/year less following a concussion and started in 5.8 fewer games/year on average. Concussed MLS and EPL goalies saw no significant change in performance, although EPL goalies played 3.2 additional games/year on average (p <0.05). The probability of playing a full season post-concussion was not significantly decreased compared with the non-concussed pool (p > 0.05) in both leagues Conclusion: This study investigating the short-term effects of concussion on professional soccer players demonstrates that performance is reduced for non-goalie players, without a significant difference in career longevity between concussed and non-concussed controls.","2019","2020-05-20 00:42:28","2020-05-20 00:42:28",NA,"",NA,"7","7",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Embase",NA,NA,NA,"; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2325967119S00340; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629239459","conference abstract; human; soccer player; controlled study; major clinical study; season; concussion; career; probability; Kaplan Meier method; longevity",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

One factor which is often overlooked is affect and exploring this could help identify the behaviour change processes, which engage individuals in a professional football club-led mental health intervention. The aim of this study was to explore the experiences of individuals attending football provided by a professional club community trust to further our understanding of the behaviour change processes involved in facilitating engagement in this provision. Method: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with twelve men who played football provided by a professional football club trust. A range of mental health problems were reported and the participants were aged between 19 and 46. Template analysis was conducted, implementing some of the concepts from the Affective – Reflective Theory (ART). Results: The results highlighted that both affective and reflective processes of ART were evident in engaging individuals in football. Pleasurable experiences were enabled through the physical and social characteristics of football. Self-control strategies emerged which help to action engagement. The professional football club trust provided coaching knowledge and skills, team organisation and resources and feelings of belonging and responsibility. Conclusion: Application of ART to the understanding of football experiences has provided a novel exploration of the processes involved in engaging individuals in football. This has important implications for intervention design; the focus should be on providing pleasurable experiences and fostering appropriate self-control strategies.","2019","2020-05-20 00:23:01","2020-05-20 00:23:01",NA,"19-30",NA,"","16",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Embase",NA,NA,NA,"; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mhpa.2019.02.002; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2001703264","adult; human; male; article; football; clinical article; physical activity; priority journal; professional knowledge; skill; depression; semi structured interview; personal experience; mental disease; mental health; social responsibility; behavior change; schizophrenia; Affective Reflective Theory; anxiety disorder; exploratory behavior; paranoia; self control; Social Cognitive Theory; social environment; social psychology",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

METHODS: A total of 19 professional soccer players from the same soccer club (age = 17.1 [0.3] y, height = 1.76 [0.69] m, and body mass = 69.7 [9.4] kg) participated in this study. Players performed 4 × 30-s (150 s recovery) all-out 1-vs-1 SSG considering 300, 200, and 100 m2 per player (48 h apart). Players' external loads were tracked with global positioning technology (20 Hz). Heart rate, blood lactate concentration (BLc), and rating of perceived exertion characterized players' internal load. Peak BLc was assessed with a 30-s all-out test on a nonmotorized treadmill (NMT). RESULTS: SSG300 produced higher BLc than SSG200 (moderate) and SSG100 (large). The SSG300, SSG200, and SSG100 BLc were 97.8% (34.8%), trivial; 74.7% (24.9%), moderate; and 43.4% (15.7%), large, of the NMT30s peak BLc, respectively. Players covered more distance at high intensity during the SSG300 than in other SSG conditions (huge to very large differences). High-intensity deceleration distance was largely lower in SSG200 than in SSG300. SSG100 elicited very large to huge and large to very large lower external load values than SSG300 and SSG200, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The main finding of this study showed an inverse association between ball-drill density and internal/external loads in long sprint ability-oriented SSG. The SSG300 provided BLc closer to individual maximal, thus satisfying the all-out construct assumed for the development of long sprint ability. Further studies using the SSG300 as a training intervention and/or investigating other different SSG formats using the same density are warranted.","2019","2020-05-20 00:17:59","2020-05-20 00:17:59",NA,"1265-1272",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Medline",NA,NA,NA,"; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1123/ijspp.2018-0645; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629461808","human; article; football; soccer player; heart rate; controlled study; deceleration; high intensity interval training; endurance; pitch; human tissue; lactate blood level; treadmill; anaerobic capacity",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Using a qualitative description methodology, semistructured interviews were conducted with 15 men who had been coached by 5 award-winning youth football coaches. The coaches were classified as pragmatic leaders. Participants' perceptions of the coaches' leadership were grouped into 3 main themes: individualized consideration, accountability/responsibility, and solving problems by valuing unique contributions. Because leadership is a process of interpersonal influence, on a practical level these themes may account for key features of the coach–athlete relationship that arise from pragmatic leadership.

The study follows the importance of the implementation of proprioceptive training as a component part of the functional rehabilitation program, thus highlighting its beneficial effects: diminishing the symptoms, increasing joint mobility and muscle strength, regaining static and dynamic stability, essential parameters of sportsmen's reintegration. The following tests were applied to the subject: joint assessment, muscle testing, Single Leg Balance Test (SLB), Single Legged Hop Test (SLH), 6 Meter Timed Hop Test, Star Excursion Balance Test (SEBT) and evaluation of symptomatology and gait using The Foot and Ankle Disability Index (FADI) Score and Sports Module questionnaire. After applying the rehabilitation program, we found that the subject developed a significant improvement of the balance on unstable surfaces (trampoline, balance board), maintaining the position in unipodal support for a duration of 4 times greater than after the initial evaluation. Also, the speed of execution for the jumps forwards over the distance of 6 meters was improved, the time difference between testing with the healthy limb (4.39 seconds) and that with the affected limb (4.67 seconds) being below 10%. Therefore, we can conclude that the recovery program led to the elimination of joint instability, the results obtained representing essential indices of functional performance.

However, little is known of the regular head loading environment associated with tackling in rugby union. In particular, the magnitude and influencing factors for head kinematics during the tackle are poorly understood. Accordingly, the goal of this study was to measure head motion of a visually unaware ball carrier during a real game tackle to the upper trunk with no direct head contact, and compare the kinematics with previously reported concussive events. Model-Based Image-Matching was utilised to measure ball carrier head linear and angular velocities. Ball carrier componential maximum change in head angular velocities of 38.1, 20.6 and 13.5 rad/s were measured for the head local X (coronal plane), Y (sagittal plane) and Z (transverse plane) axes respectively. The combination of a high legal tackle height configuration and visually unaware ball carrier can lead to kinematics similar to average values previously reported for concussive direct head impacts.

Reports initial injury 2 weeks prior when he was tackled onto turf landing on the lateral aspect of R shoulder. ATC noted AC joint pain during initial evaluation but cleared for sport. At the game on the following Friday, athlete took a hit from helmet to R scapular area and was later driven to the turf on his left. He experienced persistent pain in R posterior shoulder and bilateral AC joints. Seen at urgent care the following day and x-rays of shoulders were obtained. He now presents on Monday for evaluation. Patient is a two-sport athlete and participates in both football and wrestling with hopes to wrestle in the upcoming season. He has no significant comorbidities or past medical history. Physical Exam: General Appearance: NAD, conversant MSK: Right shoulder-No gross deformity, swelling or asymmetry. Full ROM but pain over 90 degrees mostly in the posterior shoulder. Tender over the medial scapular border and AC joint. Pain elicited with Scarf test, O'Brien's test and Speeds test. No instability. 5/5 strength but pain with all motion. Left Shoulder - No gross deformity swelling or asymmetry. Full ROM but pain over 90 degrees - mostly at the AC joint. Tender over AC joint. Pain elicited with Scarf test, O'Brien's test and Speeds test. No instability. 5/5 strength but all motion painful. Differential Diagnosis: Acromioclavicular joint separation Clavicle fracture Humerus fracture First rib fracture Rotator cuff injury Test Results: Xray L and R Shoulders: No calcifications in rotator cuffs. Glenohumeral joints and AC joints intact b/l. Oblique lucency over R first rib and R medial clavicle might represent nondisplaced fracture. No PTX. Scapula and humerus intact b/l. CT w/out contrast (3D rendering): L-sided ribs, L clavicle and humeral tuberosities intact. No HillSachs or bony Bankart. Soft tissue swelling in subq fat overlying L acromial process and AC joint. Comminuted, nondisplaced fracture through R first rib. Final Diagnosis: Nondisplaced first rib fracture. No evidence of shoulder pathology. Soft tissue swelling at L AC joint without malalignment or fracture indicating grade 1 AC dissociation. Discussion: First rib fractures are generally seen on radiographs and must not be overlooked. They can occur in isolation or in association with other rib fractures. The first rib is protected by the shoulder girdle and musculature, making fractures resulting from external trauma rare. Pain is typically under the scapula or at the clavicle and exacerbated by abduction greater than 90 degrees - this can make diagnosis difficult as it suggests shoulder pathology. Patients may also present with chest wall, neck or pleuritic pain and, rarely, weakness of the ipsilateral extremity with accompanying paresthesia. Possible complications include PTX, Horner's syndrome and thoracic outlet syndrome. Outcome: Athlete informed of first rib fracture and AC dissociation based on imaging results. For first rib fractures without any complications, treatment is mild analgesia and holding from activity until symptoms resolve. Recommended formal physical therapy regiment, as well as ibuprofen and ice for analgesia. Follow-up: Duration of rest period depends on function, not time, with return to sport when asymptomatic. Rarely, nonunion with persistent symptoms occurs, requiring surgical consult. Athlete currently in wrestling preseason and being held from both contact and conditioning. Physical therapy to improve RC strength, minimize shoulder pain and improve ROM. Follow-up with sports medicine physician in 1 month.","2019","2020-05-20 00:24:42","2020-05-20 00:24:42",NA,"e28-e29",NA,"2","29",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Embase",NA,NA,NA,"; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/JSM.0000000000000728; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629860333","sports medicine; conference abstract; human; male; football; rib fracture; controlled study; season; return to sport; adolescent; athlete; helmet; follow up; high school; motion; velocity; abduction; physiotherapy; physician; physical examination; soft tissue; complication; thorax wall; medical history; endogenous compound; wrestling; paresthesia; X ray film; differential diagnosis; weakness; comorbidity; clavicle fracture; dissociation; neck; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; shoulder pain; deformity; acromioclavicular joint; analgesia; arthralgia; calcification; first rib; Horner syndrome; humerus fracture; ibuprofen; rotator cuff injury; scapula; swelling; thorax outlet syndrome",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the role of FMS in the process of acquiring soccer-specific motor skills (measured using speed dribbling) with regard to physical fitness and biological maturation. Forty male soccer players (11.5 ± 0.3 years of age) at the highest performance level participated in the study. The test of Gross Motor Development - second edition and Unifittest 6-60 were used to assess FMS and physical fitness, respectively. The role of FMS in a complex theoretical model with the relationships between physical fitness, biological maturation and speed dribbling was analyzed by multiple regression path analyses (MRPA). Moderate to strong correlations were found between FMS, physical fitness, and speed dribbling (r = 0.56-0.66). Biological maturation did not appear to be a significant predictor of physical fitness or speed dribbling. The MRPA model using FMS as mediator variable between physical fitness and speed dribbling showed a significant indirect effect (standard estimation = −0.31, p = 0.001; R2 = 0.25). However, the direct correlation between physical fitness and speed dribbling was non-significant. Our results showed that FMS significantly strengthened the influence of physical fitness on the performance of speed dribbling, a soccer-specific motor skill, and thus play an important role in the process of acquiring sport-specific motor skills in prepubertal soccer players. When considering the long-term training process, especially during childhood and before puberty, a wide range of FMS activities should be applied for better and possibly faster acquisition of soccer-specific motor skills.","2019","2020-05-20 00:23:42","2020-05-20 00:23:42",NA,"",NA,"MAY","10",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Embase",NA,NA,NA,"; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2019.00596; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628303656","human; human experiment; male; article; soccer player; controlled study; physical performance; velocity; child; school child; motor performance; normal human; fitness; clinical assessment; correlation coefficient; age distribution; fundamental motor skill; Gross Motor Development second edition; speed dribbling; theoretical model; Unifittest 6 60",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Motor and sensory neurologic testing intact in all 4extremities. Vestibulo-Ocular: unable to visualize fundi, macula and nerve due to severe photophobia. Negative horizontal/vertical nystagmus. Unable to complete following tests due to positive symptoms and right eyelid swelling: Dolls eye, Saccades, visual motor sensitivity, convergence, Alternating cover/uncover test for phoria. Differential Diagnosis: Preseptal cellulitis Erysipelas Corneal Ulceration and Ulcerative Keratitis Contact dermatitis Atopic dermatitis Test Results: October 14, 2018 CBC significant for:Elevated neutrophils: 75% Decreased lymphocytes:15.8%. 10/17 standard concussion testing deferred. 10/23 King Devick Cards abnormal, Convergence 8 cm, Positive abnormalities on functional neuromuscular testing. Cognitive testing: normal compared to mean on following variables:Memory (verbal and visual), visual motor speed, reaction time and impulse control. Patient tolerated activity on stationary bike for 10 minutes and had recordedHR from 100to120 without dysautonomia. Final Diagnosis: Traumatic brain injury with associated morbidity of transient immunosuppression causing reactivated Herpes (VZV) Zoster Ophthalmicus. Discussion: Herpes Zoster is rare in children, having an incidence of 42:100 000 person years. Traumatic brain injury as the stressor causing activation of herpes zoster ophthalmi-cus has not been studied comprehensively. Further, existing case studies and research focuses on adult patients and research is limited on herpes zoster ophthalmicus activation in the setting of concussion in pediatric patients. Our case presents 3 profound questions. Those being does Herpes Zoster Ophthalmicus complicate concussion recovery, does traumatic brain injury cause transient immunosuppression and lastly does concurrent herpes zoster ophthalmicus and concussion have additive negative effects on ocular health. Outcome: After 2 weeks of treatment with antiviral medications, various pain medications, anti-nausea medications, anti-seizure medications, eye ointments, limited to no school and screen time and vestibular/cervical rehabilitation, the patient's symptoms related to his concussion and Herpes Zoster Ophthalmicus greatly improved. Follow-up: As of right now, the patient has been cleared to attend school with accommodations if needed and has been approved for vigorous intensity exercise. He is following up with sports medicine, ophthalmology and infectious disease specialist doctors as well as with his primary care physician as needed.","2019","2020-05-20 00:34:04","2020-05-20 00:34:04",NA,"e39-e40",NA,"2","29",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Embase",NA,NA,NA,"; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/JSM.0000000000000728; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629860519","sports medicine; adult; conference abstract; female; human; male; football; unconsciousness; exercise; major clinical study; adolescent; concussion; follow up; velocity; child; memory; reaction time; cervical spine; physical examination; remission; human cell; traumatic brain injury; dizziness; nonhuman; vision; cranial nerve; communicable disease; diagnosis; differential diagnosis; infectious disease specialist; emergency ward; headache; general practitioner; morbidity; photophobia; atopic dermatitis; Hispanic; forehead; pediatric patient; swelling; saccadic eye movement; rhythm; erythema; seizure; strabismus; antivirus agent; autonomic dysfunction; cellulitis; contact dermatitis; cornea ulcer; erysipelas; eye pain; eyelid; face pain; herpes zoster ophthalmicus; hyperacusis; immunosuppressive treatment; limb; lymphocytopenia; nausea and vomiting; neutrophil; ointment; ophthalmology; optokinetic nystagmus; positive syndrome; retina macula lutea; screen time; Varicella zoster virus",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

SETTING: Ghana National Football Association. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred fifty-nine players playing for the National male soccer teams preparing for tournaments in 2016 and 2017. INTERVENTIONS: Precompetition medical assessment using ECGs and ECHOs. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Number of athletes with abnormal ECGs and ECHO findings. RESULTS: Twenty-three percent of the players had abnormal ECGs. Nine percent of the participants had T-wave inversions in lateral leads (V5-V6). Sokolow-Lyon criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy were present in 64% of participants. Thirty-six (23%) players had left ventricular wall thickness (LVWT) ≥13 mm, with no player exceeding 16 mm. Four percent of players had left ventricular cavity dimension greater than 60 mm. Relative wall thickness >0.42 was present in 44% of the players. CONCLUSIONS: Uncommon ECG changes seem to be more common in elite Ghanaian soccer players compared with previously reported results for Caucasians and even mixed populations of black athletes. Although ST elevation, T-wave inversions, and LVWT up to 15 mm are common, ST depression, deep T-waves in lateral leads, and LVWT ≥16 mm always warrant further clinical and scientific investigations.","2019","2020-05-20 00:19:11","2020-05-20 00:19:11",NA,"",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Medline",NA,NA,NA,"; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/JSM.0000000000000801; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L630426910","adult; human; male; article; football; soccer player; Caucasian; controlled study; adolescent; cohort analysis; cross-sectional study; echocardiography; heart left ventricle hypertrophy; thickness; Ghana; medical assessment; T wave; ST segment depression; Ghanaian; heart left ventricle wall; ST segment elevation; T wave inversion",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

METHODS: Data were collected from one team (45 athletes) during the 2017 season. Self-reported wellness was collected daily (4=best score possible, 28=worst score possible). External load/session availability variables were calculated using global positioning systems/session availability data from every training session and match. Additional variables included demographic data, pre-season external loads and strength/power measures. Linear mixed models were built and compared using root mean square error (RMSE) to determine the impact of variables on wellness. RESULTS: The external load variables explained wellness to a large degree (RMSE=1.55, 95% confidence intervals=1.52 to 1.57). Modelling athlete ID as a random effect appeared to have the largest impact on wellness, improving the RMSE by 1.06 points. Aside from athlete ID, the variable that had the largest (albeit negligible) impact on wellness was sprint distance covered across pre-season. Every additional 2.1 km covered across pre-season worsened athletes' in-season wellness scores by 1.2 points (95% confidence intervals=0.0 to 2.3). CONCLUSION: The isolated impact of the individual variables on wellness was negligible. However, after accounting for the individual athlete variability, the external load variables examined collectively were were able to explain wellness to a large extent. These results validate the sensitivity of wellness to monitor individual athletes' responses to the external loads imposed on them.","2019","2020-05-20 00:22:16","2020-05-20 00:22:16",NA,"",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Medline",NA,NA,NA,"; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1249/MSS.0000000000002244; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L630493050","football player; human; article; season; global positioning system; demography",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Athletes are a group of people with special nutritional needs. High levels of physical activity affect the oxidation-reduction equilibrium. Higher oxygen uptake during exercises results in increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The main aim of the study was to evaluate the eating habits and the knowledge of antioxidants among athletes practicing selected sports disciplines. Material and methods. The study was conducted amongst 119 athletes, including football players, handball players, bodybuilders, and crossfit players, using a self-constructed questionnaire. The data was developed using Microsoft Excel 2010 and StatSoft's STATISTICA v.10. Eating habits were determined by assessing the frequency of consumption of selected products. The state of knowledge of the athletes was assessed using the original hedonic scale. The respondents could get a maximum of 9-10 points, which corresponded to a very good level of nutritional knowledge. Results. The average number of points earned by the athletes was 4.86. None of the athletes was found to have a very good nutritional knowledge. 17% of the respondents were found to have a good level of knowledge, 39% of the respondents - sufficient knowledge and in 44% of the respondents the level of knowledge was insufficient. The most commonly consumed products amongst the athletes were raw fruit and vegetables, herbs and spices, and tea. Conclusions. Based on the obtained results, it was established that the respondents' level of the knowledge of antioxidants sufficient. The age of the respondents and their experience in practiced sports were found to be correlated to a higher level of nutritional knowledge. Education did not have a significant impact on the level of knowledge.

AIM: To investigate hip and groin injury rates, especially time-trends, in men's professional football over 15 consecutive seasons. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Men's professional football. METHODS: 47 European teams were followed prospectively for a varying number of seasons between 2001/2002 and 2015/2016, totalling 268 team seasons. Time-loss injuries and individual player exposure during training and matches were recorded. Injury rate was defined as the number of injuries/1000 hours and injury burden as the number of lay-off days/1000 hours. Time-trends for total hip and groin injuries and adductor-related injury rates were analysed using Poisson regression, and injury burden was analysed using a negative binomial regression model. RESULTS: Hip and groin injuries contributed 1812 out of 12 736 injuries (14%), with adductor-related injury as the most common of hip and groin injuries (n=1139, 63%). The rates of hip and groin injury and adductor-related injury were 1.0/1000 hours and 0.6/1000 hours, and these rates decreased significantly with on average 2% (Exp(b)=0.98, 95% CI 0.97 to 0.99, P=0.003) and 3% (Exp(b)=0.97, 95% CI 0.95 to 0.99, P<0.001) per season (year on year), respectively. The seasonal trend of hip and groin injury burden did not improve (Exp(b)=0.99, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.01, P=0.40). CONCLUSIONS: Hip and groin injuries constitute a considerable part of all time-loss injuries in men's professional football. Although there was a promising slight decreasing trend in the rates of hip and groin injury (as a category) and adductor-related injury (as a specific diagnosis), the injury burden remained at a consistent level over the study period.","2019","2020-05-20 00:24:48","2020-05-20 00:24:48",NA,"539-546",NA,"9","53",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Medline",NA,NA,NA,"; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bjsports-2017-097796; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L627364931","human; male; soccer; sport injury; prospective study; injuries; inguinal region; leg injury; abdominal injury; occupational accident",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The relationship has been identified in both epidemiology and laboratory research. It has been shown that a warm up program including neck strengthening can reduce concussion incidence, however no strength measures were reported. This study looks to identify if a isometric, field based warm up can improve neck strength in an Australian football cohort. Methods: Two adolescent, semi-elite Australian football teams, each consisting of 26 players were cluster randomised to an intervention and control arm. Participants performed isometric neck strength and anthropometry measures before and after an 11-week neck strengthening program performed during the competition season. Neck strength was assessed using hand-held dynamometry (Lafayette, Model 01163, USA) in flexion, extension and left and right lateral flexion as well as left and right axial rotation. The program consisted of progressive, self-resisted isometric neck exercises conducted as part of the teams standard training warm-ups. Changes in neck strength and girth were assessed using a linear mixed model with session and intervention as the fixed effects and club and subject as the random effects Results: There was a significant interaction effect for time and group. Post hoc analysis found the intervention group showed a significant increase in mean peak force in flexion (Δx̅ = 4.56kg, p < 0.001), extension (Δx̅ = 3.88kg, p < 0.001, right lateral flexion (Δx̅ = 4.69kg, p < 0.001), left lateral flexion (Δx̅ = 3.26kg, p < 0.001), right axial rotation (Δx̅=4.66kg, p < 0.001) and left axial rotation (Δx̅ ̅=3.64kg, p < 0.001) following the intervention. There was no morphological differences observed in neck girth in both groups. Discussion: The ecologically valid, isometric neck strengthening intervention produced significantly increased isomeric neck strength in all directions in an adolescent Australian football population. However it is not know if this increase in strength was associated with reduction in concussion risk in the population. Previous work has suggested this link but further research is needed to investigate if an intervention targeting neck strength can both increase strength and reduce concussion risk.","2019","2020-05-20 00:19:00","2020-05-20 00:19:00",NA,"S47",NA,"","22",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Embase",NA,NA,NA,"; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsams.2019.08.229; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002914910","conference abstract; female; human; male; football; case report; clinical article; incidence; season; competition; adolescent; concussion; randomized controlled trial; warm up; rotation; anthropometry; dynamometry; post hoc analysis; neck; isomerization",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Participated in the study 108 athletes that represents the city of Londrina at the Youth Games of Paraná in 2008 and 2011 in the modalities of futsal, handball, basketball and volleyball. Body composition, height, body mass, vertical jumps, agility, speed tests, abdominal flexions and the Leger running test were conducted. PCA was used to summarize the variables investigated. Four principal components were identified for futsal and volleyball, representing 79,7% and 77% of the total variance and 3 principal components for basketball and handball, accounting for 77% and 81,6% of the total variance. The PCA was able to identify and discriminate the variables that most respond by the total variance in collective modalities. The variables that contributed the most to the formation of the components are in agreement with the main specific attributes of the modalities studied, thus identifying the main variables that in theory contribute to the sporting success in the modalities in question.

The present study used a controlled repeated-measures research design to investigate the changes in FFM and FM using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Whole body %FM increased (effect size (ES) = 0.87 ± 0.46) and FFM reduced after DTP (ES = -0.30 ± 0.19), returning to values comparable to the end of the previous season after RTP. At regional levels, arms, legs, and trunk %FM increased (ES = from 0.42 to 1.29) while trunk-FFM was reduced (ES=-0.40±0.26) after DTP, returning to the values observed at the end of the previous season after RTP. Legs-FFM did not change after DTP, with a substantial increase after RTP in comparison with pre-season values (ES = 0.34 ± 0.29 and 0.53 ± 0.36 for the right and left leg, respectively). Despite the small sample size of the present study, the findings indicate that elite soccer players can be allowed 2 weeks of rest during a five-week DTP, since the changes in %FM and FFM were relatively small, and FM and FFM returned to the optimal initial values for competition after the proposed RTP during the pre-season.","2019","2020-05-20 00:17:51","2020-05-20 00:17:51",NA,"",NA,"8","2019",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Embase",NA,NA,NA,"; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.7466; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629669372","adult; human; male; article; football; soccer player; controlled study; season; competition; resistance training; leg; effect size; trunk; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; fat free mass; sample size",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Methods: Ten semi-professional footballers underwent a control session (0-m) to quantify RS in a non-fatigued state; and three hypoxia sessions (0-m;1500-m;3000-m) examining RS and perceptual-cognitive skills for a given physical workload. The mean number of correct responses (%) for anticipation and decision-making accuracy were obtained at the 30-min mark of each half. HR, TC, RPE and %O2sat were measured during warm-up, football-induced fatigue and RS test. Results: HR, RPE and %O2sat were different between conditions (ES=0.44-6.13). RS were affected by football-induced fatigue for DC (4.8%;ES=0.68) and AV (5.5%;ES=0.79). In hypoxia, a 6.5% was found for DC, 6.3% for AV and 3.1% for PV at 1500-m compared to 0-m (P<0.05). Further significant changes of 12.8% DC, 12.8% AV and 6.2% PV (P<0.0005) were found at 3000-m compared to 0-m. More pronounced declines in perceptual-cognitive skills were found as altitude increased (5.0-12.5%;ES=1.17-2.41) and between halves (5.3-6.7%). Conclusion: The data demonstrates the RS test was sensitive to fatigue/hypoxia for a given physical load. Simulated matches in hypoxia revealed larger decreases, in RS and perceptual-cognitive skills, highlighting the need for optimal acclimatisation strategies, including physical and technical preparation, prior to playing at altitude.

In the Australian Football League, both subjective and objective evaluations of player match performance are commonplace. This study aimed to identify the extent to which performance indicators can explain subjective ratings of player performance. A secondary aim was to compare subjective and objective ratings of player performance. Inside Football Player Ratings (IFPR) and Australian Football League Player Ratings were collected as subjective and objective evaluations of player performance, respectively, for each player during all 1026 matches throughout the 2013-2017 Australian Football League seasons. Nine common player performance indicators, player role classification, player age and match outcomes were also collected. Standardised linear mixed model and recursive partitioning and regression tree models were undertaken across the whole dataset, as well as separately for each of the seven player roles. The mixed model analysis produced a model associating the performance indicators with IFPR at a root mean square error of 0.98. Random effects accounting for differences between seasons and players ranged by 0.09 and 1.73 IFPR each across the five seasons and 1052 players, respectively. The recursive partitioning and regression tree model explained IFPR exactly in 35.8% of instances, and to within 1.0 IFPR point in 81.0% of instances. When analysed separately by player role, exact explanation varied from 25.2% to 41.7%, and within 1.0 IFPR point from 70.3% to 88.6%. Overall, kicks and handballs were most associated with the IFPR. This study highlights that a select few features account for a majority of the variance when explaining subjective ratings of player performance, and that these vary by player role. Australian Football League organisations should utilise both subjective and objective assessments of performance to gain a better understanding of the differences associated with subjective performance assessment.","2019","2020-05-20 00:11:36","2020-05-20 00:11:36",NA,"",NA,"8","14",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Embase Medline",NA,NA,NA,"; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0220901; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002596375","football player; human; article; season; organization",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The study included 20 players in the U14 (n = 10; age: 13.6 ± 0.5 years old; height: 163.7 ± 5.9 cm; weight: 51.5 ± 6.0 kg) and U16 (n=10; age: 15.8 ± 0.4 years old; height: 171.8 ± 7.6 cm; weight: 61.2 ± 9.5 kg) categories competing in a regional division. The physical demands and technical-tactical behaviour of the players were recorded when they played against opponents with a higher (HIG) and lower (LOW) level of opposition. In the U14 category, total distance (TD), relative distance (RD) and high-intensity distance (HID) were greater (p < .05) against LOW opponents. In addition, the distance travelled in low-speed ranges (%DV1 and %DV2) increased when the U14 played against HIG. The technical-tactical analysis indicated that the teams performed more (p < .05) shots (TS), goals (GS), pressure after loss (PAL) and counterattacks (CON) when they played against LOW. The physical demands (TD, RD and HID) in U14 football players and the technical-tactical behaviour of the players (TS, GS, PAL and CON) increased when playing against opponents considered at a lower level.

Data were obtained for the 2012/13-2015/16 school years from the National High School Sports-Related Injury Surveillance System, High School RIO™. This Internet-based sports injury surveillance system captures data reported by athletic trainers from an annual average of 162 U.S. high schools. Data were analyzed to describe circumstances of soccer concussion (e.g., symptomology, symptom resolution, and return-to-play time) by impact location (i.e., front- [face included], back-, side-, and top-of-the-head) and sex. Most concussions were from front-of-the-head impacts (boys, 30.5%; girls, 34.0%). Overall, 4.1 ± 2.2 and 4.6 ± 2.3 symptoms were reported in boys and girls, respectively. In boys, symptom frequency was not associated with head impact location (p = 0.66); an association was found in girls (p = 0.02), with the highest symptom frequency reported in top-of-the-head impacts (5.4 ± 2.2). Head impact location was not associated with symptom resolution time (boys, p = 0.21; girls, p = 0.19) or return-to-play time (boys, p = 0.18; girls, p = 0.07). Heading was associated with 28.0% and 26.5% of concussions in boys and girls, respectively. Most player-player contact concussions during heading occurred from side-of-the-head impacts (boys, 49.4%; girls, 43.2%); most heading-related ball contact concussions occurred from front-of-the-head (boys, 41.4%; girls, 42.6%) and top-of-the-head (boys, 34.5%; girls, 36.9%) impacts. Head impact location was generally independent of symptom resolution time, return-to-play time, and recurrence among high school soccer concussions.

METHODS: Data from 15 consecutive seasons of European professional football between 2001 and 2016 contributed to the dataset of this study. Match play and training data from a total of 3677 players from 61 teams across 17 countries have been included. Team medical staff recorded player exposure and time loss injuries. Injury incidence was defined as the number of injuries per 1000 player-hours. Injury burden was defined as number of days absence per 1000 player-hours. Seasonal trends for isolated syndesmotic injury incidence, isolated syndesmotic injury proportion of ankle ligament injuries and isolated syndesmotic injury burden were analysed via linear regression. RESULTS: The isolated syndesmotic injury incidence was 0.05 injuries per 1000 hours of exposure (95% CI 0.04 to 0.06) or one injury per team every three seasons. The injury incidence during match play was 13 times higher compared with during training, 0.21 (95% CI 0.16 to 0.26) and 0.02 (95% CI 0.01 to 0.02), respectively. Out of the 1320 ankle ligament injuries registered during the 15 seasons, 94 (7%) were diagnosed as isolated syndesmotic injuries. An annual increase in injury incidence was observed (R2=0.495, b=0.003, 95% CI 0.001 to 0.004, P=0.003). However, no significant annual change of injury burden was observed (R2=0.033, b=0.032, 95% CI -0.073 to 0.138, P=0.520). Seventy-four per cent of the injuries were contact related, and the mean (±SD) absence following an isolated syndesmotic injury was 39 (±28) days.

Thus, it is necessary to know the indexes that characterize official matches of F7 for the prescription of the exercise and monitoring of the training load. Therefore, the objective of the study was to analyze the physical demand of game in official matches of F7. Sixty-five male players of six federated teams of Santa Catarina agreed to participate in the study. Eight matches were analyzed in an official championship using a global positioning system (GPS) and heart rate (HR) monitor, in order to record the total distance traveled, speed and HR. The results showed a greater total distance traveled (TDTRELATIVE, 101.4 ± 11.8 vs. 96.6 ± 14.5 m.min-1), as well as lower mean HR (171 ± 10 vs. 175 ± 9 bpm) in the first half compared to the second half. From the total playing time, the athletes remained on average 48 ± 7.2% jogging, 16.5 ± 4.4% in high intensity running and 3.8 ± 1.8% in sprint. In relation to the physiological demand of the matches, it was verified that the players maintained on average 90.2 ± 2.0% HRMAX and supported 71.0 ± 23.0% of the total game time in intensity above 85% of HRMAX. We conclude that F7 players are submitted to high physical demands in official matches. Based on these findings, coaches and physical trainers can improve the prescription and monitoring of training loads, aiming at greater sports performance.

Findings of the template analysis indicate that organizational stressors and environmental issues were dominant but differed in nature between the training camp and competition settings. Players experienced more uncontrollable situations than controllable ones in both settings and thus made greater use of emotion-focused coping strategies as a means to reduce stress. Disengagement and 'working off the energy' were the most frequently cited coping strategies. 'Silently the Fijian way' was identified by the players as a culturally specific form of coping.

The athletes (weight 62-73 kg - mean 67.79 ± 4.79; height 173 - 187 - mean 179.78 ± 5.23) divided into group A and B, took part in training (weekly- monthly) with the technical staff. Only 10 athletes of group B, partecipated 20 additional training sessions to improve their technical and physical learning. Results and conclusion - The final result for both groups showed significant improvements in young athletes performances with particular reference to the percentage of accuracy of passages and shots on goal, valued around 5-7% (average percentage 6%). Group B said to have received benefits after participating extra training sessions, showing an increase in muscle tone, a better breathing control and greater accuracy in passages and shots on goal, proving validity of choices in training method.

Final functional outcomes are generally excellent, though recurrent symptoms may delay the return to play. There is a lack of published evidence on conservative management and rehabilitation for this injury. The aim of this case study is to describe a comprehensive and successful rehabilitation plan of a youth elite soccer player. Case Presentation: A 16-year-old male centre-back soccer player sustained a left iliac crest avulsion fracture. The injury occurred while executing a right-footed long cross of the ball, right to left. Intervention: After a short period of rest (including a lumbosacral orthosis), rehabilitation progressed from non-weight-bearing through to an array of sports-specific full weight-bearing exercises. The field sessions were individualised, based on the player's physiological profile and match characteristics in non-linear dynamics. Outcomes: The player recovered fully and returned pain-free at the same international football level after 14 weeks. There has been no recurrence since. Conclusion: An iliac crest avulsion fracture in youth soccer can be fully recovered by conservative management. Early diagnosis, close monitoring, progressive (individualised) sports-specific rehabilitation and good compliance were key factors in the successful return to play.

Changes in SSG characteristics (e.g., pitch size, rules, number of players per team) allow coaches to emphasize specific behaviors, according to the goal of the training session. Additionally, changes in teams' composition criteria might influence the interactions between players during teams' offensive process. Teams ' composition criteria are the rules used to divide players into teams. This study analyzed the influence of teams' composition criteria in the network properties during soccer small-sided games. Twelve male U-15 soccer athletes from a high-level team from the city of Curitiba participated in the study. Athletes performed four small-sided games bouts in the 3vs.3 + goalkeepers format with two team composition criteria: a) three athletes from the same playing position (e.g., three forwards) on each team; and b) three athletes from different playing positions (e.g., a defender, a midfielder and a forward) in each team. Network properties (related to the team -- macro analysis) and levels of prominence (related to the athletes -- micro analysis) were analyzed through the Social Network Analysis. An one-way ANOVA (or Kruskal-Wallis test for non-parametric variables) was used to compare the mean values between playing positions. For the macro analysis, an independent t-test (or Mann-Whitney test for non-parametric variables) was used. In all cases, the level of significance was set at p <0.05. Results showed lower prominence of goalkeepers compared to the other positions using both teams' composition criteria. Midfielders also presented lower prominence compared to defenders when team were formed by athletes of the same position. In summary, changes in teams' composition criteria modify athletes' levels of prominence during 3vs.3 small-sided games.

Wearable instrumented technology was used to observe and characterize the level of exposure to head impacts during game play. Purpose: To verify the impacts recorded by the x-patch™ with video analysis. Study design: Observational case series. Methods: The x-patch™ was used on eight men’s semi-professional rugby league players during the 2016 Newcastle Rugby League competition (five forwards and three backs). Game day footage was recorded by a trained videographer using a single camera located at the highest midfield location to verify the impact recorded by the x-patch™. Videographic and accelerometer data were time synchronized. Results: The x-patch™ sensors recorded a total of 779 impacts ≥ 20 g during the games, of which 732 (94.0%) were verified on video. In addition, 817 impacts were identified on video that did not record an impact on the sensors. The number of video-verified impacts ≥ 20 g, per playing hour, was 7.8 for forwards and 4.8 for backs (range = 3.9–19.0). Impacts resulting in a diagnosed concussion had much greater peak linear acceleration (M = 76.1 g, SD = 17.0) than impacts that did not result in a concussion (M = 34.2g, SD = 18.0; Cohen’s d = 2.4). Conclusions: The vast majority (94%) of impacts ≥ 20 g captured by the x-patch™ sensor were video verified in semi-professional rugby league games. The use of a secondary source of information to verify impact events recorded by wearable sensors is beneficial in clarifying game events and exposure levels.","2019","2020-05-20 00:57:29","2020-05-20 00:57:29",NA,"",NA,"1","5",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Embase",NA,NA,NA,"; ","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002877122; http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40798-019-0182-3","adult; human; male; article; rugby; acceleration; observational study; prospective study; accelerometer; videorecording; neurophysiology; head impact; biosensor; electronic sensor; health impact assessment; x-patch",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Many studies have examined successful passing via network analysis; however, no research has attempted to understand the broken passing connections as a network in football. Method: In a first of its kind study, we assessed a teams' unsuccessful or 'broken' passing links using network analysis. The analysis used the 2018 UEFA Champions League final between Real Madrid and Liverpool. The broken passing links were identified and analysed using network analysis to determine team and individual network characteristics. Results: Eventual winners Real Madrid had fewer players involved in the broken passing links network, compared to Liverpool. The analysis also highlights the individual contributions, in terms of passers and intended recipients within the broken passing links network. Discussion: This short communication study has demonstrated a novel use of network analysis to analyse the broken passing networks in football. This extension to the utility of network analysis in football could be used as a tool for coaches and match analysts to understand team and opposition performance. Further research is recommended to test the method across multiple games, levels of competition, and pitch location, of the broken passing links.

The purpose of this article is to describe physical activities of quality football referees during matchplay from mechanical and physiological aspect. Research findings have shown that during a competitive match referee may cover 9-13 km, of which 4-18% is covered at high intensity. High- to low-intensity activity ratio may be defined as 1:4.3. Regarding match physiological responses, it has been reported that mean match heart rate is between 162 and 165 beats per minute, which totals up to approximately 85% of maximal heart rate. Mean match oxygen uptake (VO2) is about 80% of VO2max. Blood lactate concentration has been reported to be approximately 5 mmol/L; however, concentrations as high as 14 mmol/L have been observed at the end of the second half. Concerning exercise planning we would like to stress the importance of speed endurance training and speed training with a prior development of aerobic fitness, as optimal physical fitness is required for quality football refereeing.

Recently, a new mechanism, autophagy, was introduced to the adaptations induced by acute and chronic exercise as responsible of positive metabolic modification and health-longevity promotion. However, the molecular mechanisms regulating autophagy in response to physical activity and exercise are sparsely described. We investigated the long-term adaptations resulting from lifelong recreational football training on the expression of skeletal muscle markers involved in autophagy signaling. We demonstrated that lifelong football training increased the expression of messengers: RAD23A, HSPB6, RAB1B, TRAP1, SIRT2, and HSBPB1, involved in the auto-lysosomal and proteasome-mediated protein degradation machinery; of RPL1, RPL4, RPL36, MRLP37, involved in cellular growth and differentiation processes; of the Bcl-2, HSP70, HSP90, PSMD13, and of the ATG5-ATG12 protein complex, involved in proteasome promotion and autophagy processes in muscle samples from lifelong trained subjects compared to age-matched untrained controls.

We examined the birthdate distributions of 334 elite football players from Real Club Deportivo de la Coruña: 195 young soccer players (DTG) divided into 11 age groups (U-9 to U-23), 110 professional players (FTG), and 29 players who debuted in competitive matches with the club's first team from the youth development programme (EG). Playing time was calculated by adding up all the minutes played by a player in official competition during a season. The Chi-square test results show that the RAE exists in the 3 groups and in all the 11 age groups of the DTG players. The RAE was significantly lower in the FTG compared to the DTG and EG groups (Mann-Whitney U test, p < .05). There were no differences in playing minutes between players born in the first half of the year or in the second half of the year. These findings suggest that the RAE in elite clubs originates fundamentally in the talent selection process in all categories, but mainly in the youngest ones, and is maintained in all the lower categories, influencing the chances of making a first-team debut. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR El objetivo de estudio fue analizar el efecto de la edad relativa (RAE) en todas las categorías formativas de un club de fútbol profesional, e identificar si este afecta al tiempo de participación de los jugadores en competición y a sus posibilidades de debutar en el fútbol profesional. Se analizó la distribución de las fechas de nacimiento de 334 futbolistas de élite del Real Club Deportivo de la Coruña: 195 jugadores en edades de formación (GCI) divididos en 11 subgrupos correspondientes a sus categorías de edad (U9-U23), 110 jugadores profesionales (GPE) y 29 jugadores que debutaron en partido oficial con el primer equipo del club desde de las categorías inferiores (GE). Se calculó la suma de todos los minutos disputados por un futbolista en competición oficial durante una temporada. Los resultados del test ji cuadrado demostraron la existencia de RAE en los 3 grupos de jugadores analizados y en todos los subgrupos de edad de los jugadores del GCI. El RAE fue significativamente menor en el GPE en comparación con los grupos GCI y GE (Mann--Whitney U-test, p < .05). No se encontraron diferencias en el número de minutos disputados en función del semestre de nacimiento.

OBJECTIVES: To present and compare a wide range of functional movement patterns and body composition (BC) parameters of high-level male athletes playing different sports and to determine if there was a relationship between the parameters examined. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Team facilities. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 30 volleyball, 25 soccer, and 30 rugby players (age = 25.9 [5.0] y and body mass index = 25.6 [4.1] kg/m2). INTERVENTIONS: Functional movement patterns and anthropometric measurements were collected by a physician specifically trained. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Body mass index, fat mass, fat-free mass, upper-arm muscle and fat area, calf muscle and fat area, thigh muscle and fat area, and functional movement screen (FMS) scores. In addition to considering the FMS total score, the authors separated the screen into 3 parts: FMSmove, FMSflex, and FMSstab. RESULTS: The rugby players showed a higher number of asymmetrical and dysfunctional movements than the other athletes (P < .01), while the highest scores in FMSflex were obtained by the volleyball players (P < .01). In addition, most of the asymmetrical and painful movements in the athletes were measured on the shoulder mobility test. Muscle and fat areas differed significantly among the athletes (P < .05). Significant associations were found between movement patterns and several BC variables. In particular, large negative correlations were measured between percentage of fat mass (r = -.616; P < .01), upper-arm fat area (r = -.519; P < .01), and FMS total score. CONCLUSIONS: Functional movement patterns and BC differ in athletes according to the sport practiced.

Professional football players (n = 28) from a first division Brazilian club had RPE collected after training sessions during 10 weeks of the regular season. Athletes were divided in groups according to their playing positions (GK, n = 3; CB, n = 4; FB, n = 5; CMF n = 5; AMF, n = 4; WMF n = 4; and FWD; n = 4).Descriptive analysis of the sample was followed by the application of the Welch's F-Test with Games-Howell post-hoc for RPE analysis of variance across positions. All playing positions reported ""moderate"" as mean- and mode-RPE (GK=3,19±0,64; CB=3,85±1,29; FB=3,87±1,39; CMF=3,99±1,28; AMF=3,78±1,25; WMF=3,59±1,18; FWD = 3,70±1,08), open field positions perceived effort in all intensity zones, while GK perceived sessions within a narrower range of intensities. GK reported significant lower RPE than any other playing position (FGOL, FWD = 18,61; p<0,0001), and CMF reported higher RPE than all others open-field positions, although the difference is only significant with respect to WMF (p<0,05). In conclusion, RPE is influenced by playing position and the physical activity profile performed. GK' lower RPE may be caused by the participation in open-field activities with the group of players as these activities are known to be less demanding than the position-specific training. Therefore, collecting GK' RPE also after the position specific training block can contribute with goalkeepers' coaches in their training planning and load monitoring. Additionally, differences in RPE of CMF and WMF shed a light on the influence of running activity on perceived exertion and its relationship with tactical roles.

The purpose of this study was to quantify the effect of concussions on professional football player performance. Methods: Concussion data from the National Football League was collected for a period of four seasons (2012- 2015) for running backs and wide receivers. Demographic variables (age, experience, position, time to return, yearly total yards and touchdowns) were recorded. Power ratings (total yards divided by 10 plus touchdowns multiplied by 6) were calculated for the injury season as well as for the 3 seasons before and after the injury. A control group consisted of running backs and wide receivers without an identified concussion injury who competed in the 2014 season. Results: One hundred and eighteen running backs and wide receivers sustained a concussion over a 4-season period, 25 players (21%) never returned to a National Football League game. Players were able to return in an average of 18.5 ± 8.2 days, missing 1.6 ± 1.0 games. For 18 players with a minimum total power rating of (sum of 4 seasons) of 200 points, power rating per game decreased 43.4 ± 0.4 points from three seasons prior to the concussion to three years postinjury. This change in performance was not statistically significant (P=0.422) when compared with the change for the 343 control players. Conclusion: Over one fifth of National Football League running backs and wide receivers who sustain a concussion never return to play in a game. On return to competition, player performance of injured players reduced from before injury, however there was no difference compared to controls.","2019","2020-05-20 00:34:23","2020-05-20 00:34:23",NA,"",NA,"7","7",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Embase",NA,NA,NA,"; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2325967119S00412; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629238949","conference abstract; football player; human; controlled study; season; competition; concussion; running; quantitative analysis",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Abstract One question facing professional football (soccer) players in today's highly mobile football labor market is how to move between teams and develop boundaryless careers that positively signal their qualities, skills, and value to the market. The author departs from previous researchers, who have conceptualized market values as a function of performance and human capital factors at one point in time. Instead, the author argues that market observers face imperfect information when estimating the value of players, which they overcome by using job mobility as a signal for the qualities, skills, and playing potential of footballers. Analyzing a unique longitudinal dataset of 1670 professional player careers with fixed effects panel regressions, results indicate that upward mobility is a positive signal shifting observers' estimations of player market values up and downward mobility is a negative signal pushing market values down. Each extra move up leads to an additional increase in market values and the negative impact of downward mobility decreases when players take up more important roles in their new team. The impact of mobility on player market values is thus contingent on broader career patterns and the context in which job mobility takes place.

We assumed that the aim at the content in small-sided games would significantly affect the HR values of participating soccer players. The research group was comprised of players (n = 6) of the soccer club FK DAC 1904 Dunajská Streda (U15) at the age of 14 ± 0.7 years. The HR values were evaluated on the basis of collected data, which we obtained using sport testers and special software POLAR TEAM2. In order to find out the statistical significance of the difference in HR was used the One-Way ANOVA and the Bonferroni post hoc test. The level of statistical significance was set at 5 %. We found out that by the change of the small-sided game's content focus, the internal reaction of players' organism to training load was at different level. In the SSG3, with the emphasis on the improvement of individual's final offensive game activity – shooting, was recorded the highest achieved HRavg value of the monitored players (181.83 ±7.11 beats.min−1). This form of the SSG was the most intense. However, there were no significant differences in HR values among the individual forms of the SSG. Our recommendation is to employ in the systematic training process small forms of small-sided games with various content focus, because by the means of it we can adequately prepare the players for the match load itself.

Introduction Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture is one of the most threatening injuries which occurs during sport activities, especially at high levels of performance. Screening methods to assess and understand neuromuscular behaviour after ACL injury and then the appropriate recovery, need to be developed to safeguard athletes’ when return to the on-field sport practice. Nowadays scientific literature identify the biomechanical analysis of the Single-Leg Drop Landing (SLDL) task as predictive of ACL injury [1,2], however very few studies investigated the role of muscle forces [3,4]. 2. Research Question The aim of this study is to verify the role plaid by lower limb (LL) and trunk muscle forces in the neuromuscular control of a group of elite athletes before and after ACL reconstruction. 3. Methods Thirteen male elite players (25.0 ± 7.5 yr, 23.55 ± 2.1 BMI) with no previous injuries and four male elite rugby players (24.5 ± 6.6 yr, 29.1 ± 4.0 BMI) with ACL injury were recruited and analysed before (BAR) and two six months after the ACL reconstruction (AAR). All participants signed an informed consent, then executed a static trial and 3 SLDL tasks from a box of 32-cm height onto a 3D force platform (Bertec FP2060, 960 Hz). A 3D motion capture systems (BTS, 6 cameras, 60-120 Hz) synchronized with two force plates and an 8-channel surface electromyography (sEMG) system (Free 1000 BTS, 1000 Hz) were adopted. Thirty reflective markers were applied according to [6], and the activity of Rectus Femoris, Biceps Femoris Caput Longus, Tibialis Anterior, Gastrocnemius Lateralis was recorded bilaterally. Muscle forces were determined through musculoskeletal modelling (MSM) in OpenSim, (model Gait 2392) [5–7]. The 2 seconds after the foot contact on the platform were considered [1–4] for the analysis. For validation purposes the peak of the envelope occurrence in OpenSim was compared with the experimentally measured sEMG [8]; the Wilcoxon test (p < 0.05) was used. Joint kinematics, kinetics, muscle forces of both the BAR and AAR groups were compared with those of the control group; the U-Mann-Whitney test (p < 0.05) was used. 4. Results Significant differences were observed (p < 0.05) between the muscle forces of the BAR or the AAR athletes and the control group (Fig.1). 5. Discussion Results of the current study support the hypothesis that muscle forces play an important role in highlighting impairments at the level of neuromuscular control in ACL injury athletes and can be used as guiding parameter for determining the optimal return on field time. Important limits should be outline: the small sample, the 1 DoF knee model available in Gait 2392 that was not subject specific in term of geometry derived from MRI, and EMG-driven muscle forces computation. Future analysis should be performed to overcome these limitations.

The authors examined active professional American football players over a 6-year time period to study potential TAI after concussion and assess optimal methods to analyze DTI at the individual level. METHODS: Active American professional football players recruited prospectively were assessed with DTI, conventional MRI, and standard clinical workup. Subjects underwent an optional preseason baseline scan and were asked to undergo a scan within 5 days of concussion during gameplay. DTI from 25 age- and sex-matched controls were obtained. Both semiautomated region-of-interest analysis and fully automated tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) were used to examine DTI at individual and group levels. Statistical differences were assessed comparing individual DTI data to baseline imaging versus a normative database. Group-level comparisons were also performed to determine if longer exposure to professional-level play or prior concussion cause white matter microstructural integrity changes. RESULTS: Forty-nine active professional football players were recruited into the study. Of the 49 players, 7 were assessed at baseline during the preseason and after acute concussion. An additional 18 players were assessed after acute concussion only. An additional 24 players had only preseason baseline assessments. The results suggest DTI is more sensitive to suspected TAI than conventional MRI, given that 4 players demonstrated decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) in multiple tracts despite normal conventional MRI. Furthermore, the data suggest individual assessment of DTI data using baseline premorbid imaging is more sensitive than typical methods of comparing data to a normative control group. Among all subjects with baseline data, 1 reduced FA tract (± 2.5 standard deviations) was found using the typical normative database reference versus 10 statistically significant (p < 0.05) reduced FA tracts when referencing internal control baseline data. All group-level comparisons were statistically insignificant (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Baseline premorbid DTI data for individual DTI analysis provides increased statistical sensitivity. Specificity using baseline imaging also increases because numerous potential etiologies for reduced FA may exist prior to a concussion. These data suggest that there is a high potential for false-positive and false-negative assessment of DTI data using typical methods of comparing an individual to normative groups given the variability of FA values in the normal population.","2019","2020-05-20 00:26:33","2020-05-20 00:26:33",NA,"1-9",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Medline",NA,NA,NA,"; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.3171/2019.3.JNS181864; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629244814","adult; female; football player; human; male; article; controlled study; prospective study; concussion; diffusion tensor imaging; traumatic brain injury; axonal injury; fractional anisotropy; corona radiata (brain); neurology; protein kinase p60; uncinate fasciculus",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Due to missing immediate visible symptoms the currently used techniques have limited abilities to identify mTBI. Therefore, there is a need for a simple and reliable biofluid-based diagnostic test for TBI patients. In our study we used digital-ELISA to perform analysis of protein biomarkers (neurofilament light chain and tau protein) in blood serum of the athletes. The results indicated altered dynamics of protein markers following high intensity exercise, heading and concussion. Based on these results, expression analyses for microRNAs (miRNAs) were performed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Specific miRNAs have been previously reported as dysregulated after TBI conditions and therefore miRNAs could possibly represent a potential peripheral biomarker.

Results: At the LFP level, 831 injuries were recorded for 262,052 hours of activities. There were 11.2 times more risk of injury in competition than training (17.2/1000 h vs. 1.53/1000 h). The main location was at the thigh level (n = 308) with an injury on 2 of muscular origin mainly to the hamstrings and stage 3 to the classification of Durey and Rodineau. A player was risking an average of 0.9 muscle injury > 3 days of sporting downtime over a season. Severe injuries (28 days off) were for one injury in 3 (n = 255). Discussion: This is the second study in France, with the aim of determining the incidence and characteristics of the injuries of the adult football players. We couldn't perform analyses of variances due to the lack of data from club trauma by club. It was only an average. Furthermore, our results only considered injuries > 3 days. However, we could observe similarities with data from other European and international championships. Conclusion: The competition leads to more trauma and injuries with risk of severity more increased compared to the training. The main nature of the injury remains muscular with a preferred location at thigh level and especially at the hamstrings. The use of a common medical software for all clubs is an important step forward for the monitoring of the professional football in France. The rigorous use of this software, with technical adaptations to be made, will eventually get a real medical identity of the French professional football player. The traumatic risk in professional football is high. The objective was to determine the risk and the nature of the occurrence of trauma injuries as well as the incidence of trauma in competition and training.","2019","2020-05-20 00:54:42","2020-05-20 00:54:42",NA,"75-85",NA,"2","36",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English French",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Embase",NA,NA,NA,"; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jts.2019.03.002; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2001827128","football player; human; article; soccer player; sport injury; hamstring muscle; risk assessment; retrospective study; medical staff; Internet; muscle injury; injury severity; France",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

DESIGN: Reliability study. PATIENTS: Thirty noninjured high-level (Tegner Activity Score ≥9) rugby players, free from hamstring injury in the previous 2 months. ASSESSMENT: Isometric knee flexor strength (in N) in prone 0/15 degrees (hip/knee flexion) and supine 90/90 degrees position. Tests were performed by 1 female and 2 male testers whose upper-body strength was measured with a 6-repetition maximum bench press test. The prone 0/15 degrees measurement was performed with manual and external belt fixation of the dynamometer. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Absolute and relative intertester reliability were calculated using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and minimal detectable change. Paired t-tests were used to identify systematic measurement error between testers and to test for a difference in recorded knee flexor strength between methods of dynamometer fixation. METHODS: Isometric knee flexor strength was measured in prone 0/15 degrees (hip/knee flexion) and supine 90/90 degrees position. RESULTS: Good intertester reliability was found for all pairwise comparisons (ICC 0.80-0.87). MDCs (as percentage of mean strength) ranged from 15.2% to 25.4%. For tester couples where systematic error was identified, Bland-Altman plots and Pearson correlation coefficients demonstrated no statistically significant correlation between mean knee flexor strength and between-tester difference. There was no significant difference in isometric knee flexor strength between manual and belt fixation of the dynamometer. CONCLUSIONS: In strong high-level rugby players, hand-held dynamometry for isometric knee flexor strength assessment in prone 0/15 degrees and supine 90/90 degrees position is intertester reliable.","2019","2020-05-20 00:08:38","2020-05-20 00:08:38",NA,"",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Medline",NA,NA,NA,"; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/JSM.0000000000000793; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L630274100","adult; female; human; male; article; rugby; hip; injury; controlled study; knee function; reliability; correlation coefficient; dynamometer; dynamometry; intermethod comparison; measurement error; minimum detectable change; systematic error",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Methods: After a 24-h CHO-loading protocol of 8 and 2 g/kg in the prematch meal, 2 elite male forward players had biopsies sampled from m. vastus lateralis before and after participation in a South Australian Football League game. Player A (87.2 kg) consumed water only during match play, whereas player B (87.6 kg) consumed 88 g CHO via CHO gels. External load was quantified using global positioning system technology. Results: Player A completed more minutes on the ground (115 vs 98 min) and covered greater total distance (12.2 vs 11.2 km) than player B, although with similar high-speed running (837 vs 1070 m) and sprinting (135 vs 138 m). Muscle glycogen decreased by 66% in player A (pre: 656 mmol/kg dry weight [dw], post: 223 mmol/kg dw) and 24% in player B (pre: 544 mmol/kg dw, post: 416 mmol/kg dw). Conclusion: Prematch CHO loading elevated muscle glycogen concentrations (ie, >500 mmol/kg dw), the magnitude of which appears sufficient to meet the metabolic demands of elite AF match play. The glycogen cost of AF match play may be greater than in soccer and rugby, and CHO feeding may also spare muscle glycogen use. Further studies using larger sample sizes are now required to quantify the interindividual variability of glycogen cost of match play (including muscle and fiber-type-specific responses), as well examining potential metabolic and ergogenic effects of CHO feeding.

Twenty male professional futsal players (age: 27.8 ± 5.7 years old; height: 173.8 ± 5.6 cm; weight: 71.5 ± 7.9 kg) that participated in the first futsal league of Portugal were monitored in all training sessions and matches during a full season. Session ratings of perceived exertion and a Hooper questionnaire (to measure muscle soreness, stress, fatigue, and sleep) were used to monitor the IL and well-being, respectively. Almost certain large decreases in IL during congested weeks in training session MD-3 were observed (−27.7%, [−35.8;−18.6]).

This goal was achieved using the following methods: video recording, chronometry and by measuring the length of the step. The required data were acquired from the playback of the game videos of professional teams that participated in the study. In addition, we accounted for the pedometer information, performance of each player from these teams, and the data on the length of the step in all components of locomotor activities that were studied. Quantitative values of the main components of locomotor activities (walking, jogging, running, and sprinting) of the studied players from professional teams were established during the competitive period of 16 games. During the futsal game, the longest distance is covered by pivots, and a much shorter distance is covered by defenders. However, this distance is longer than that of goalkeepers. In the structure of pivots' locomotor activity, jogging is the dominant movement; for defenders -- running is dominant; for goalkeepers -- walking is dominant. During the game, pivots use jogging and sprinting more often than defenders, and defenders use walking and running more often than forwards. According to the study results, the shortcomings in locomotor activities of each player from the professional teams that participated in the study were determined in addition to possible areas of improvement. Coaches can benefit from these results to understand how players with different roles organize themselves during official matches. This will help develop training programs that will increase the effectiveness of technical and tactical training by taking into account the peculiarities of locomotor activities of futsal players.

Studies have documented emergency preparedness and medical coverage standards in the high school athletic setting. However, similar examinations do not exist for youth club sport teams. PURPOSE: To determine if differences in emergency preparedness and medical coverage exist between high school team coaches and high school-aged club team coaches. A secondary purpose was to compare emergency training characteristics between high school and club coaches. METHODS: A total of 769 coaches (female N=266, 34.6%, age: 41.0±11.5 years) completed an anonymous online questionnaire regarding their emergency preparedness and training. Coaches from 3 sports were surveyed (basketball N=290, volleyball N=256, soccer N=223). The questionnaire consisted of 1) demographics and information regarding the teams that the respondent coaches, 2) emergency preparedness factors such as automated external defibrillator (AED) availability, emergency action plan (EAP) awareness, and medical coverage, and 3) emergency care training requirements (CPR, AED, first aid). Chi-square tests were used to compare response frequencies to various emergency preparedness questions between high school and club coaches. RESULTS: Overall, 64.6% (N=497) respondents were coaches of a high school team, and 35.4% (N=272) were coaches of a club team with high school-aged athletes. High school coaches were more likely than club coaches to be aware of the EAP for their practice venue (83.9% vs. 54.4%, p<.001), but most coaches in both categories had not practiced their EAP in the past 12 months (70.0% vs. 68.9%, p=.54). During competitions, high school coaches were more likely than club coaches to be aware of the EAP (47.5% vs. 37.1%, p=.02). However, the majority of coaches in each category reported that they were never aware of EAPs during competition. High school coaches were more likely than club coaches to 1) have an AED available at practice (87.9% vs. 58.8%, p<.001), 2), to report that athletic trainers were responsible for medical care at practices (31.2% vs. 8.8%, p<.001) and competitions (57.9% vs. 31.2%, p<.001), and 3) to be required to have CPR, AED, or first aid training (p<.001). Nearly all (98.8%) high school coaches were required to have CPR training, and overall, 58.6% of high school coaches were required to have training in all 3 categories (CPR, AED, first aid) compared to 23.9% of club coaches (p<.001). CONCLUSIONS: High school sport coaches displayed greater levels of emergency preparedness and training compared to coaches of high school-aged club teams. Significant attention and effort is needed to improve emergency preparedness and medical coverage at the club sports level among basketball, soccer, and volleyball coaches.","2019","2020-05-20 00:11:48","2020-05-20 00:11:48",NA,"N.PAG-N.PAG",NA,"","7",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"c8h",NA,NA,NA,"","https://gateway.library.qut.edu.au/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=c8h&AN=136537098&site=ehost-live&scope=site","Congresses and Conferences -- Georgia; Georgia; Coaches, Athletic -- Psychosocial Factors; Emergency Care; Professional Knowledge; Schools, Secondary",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Understanding their relationship may further determine their suitability for use. Design: Clinical case series Method: Eighteen professional footballers completed two adductor squeeze tests (short and long lever), the HAGOS (sport) and Bent Knee Fall Out (BKFO); 2 days post-match, during a period of 4 months. Results: Adductor strength reduced beyond the minimal detectable change (MDC) on 16 occasions for the long-lever squeeze (MDC = 7%) and 7 occasions for short-lever squeeze (MDC = 15%). On 17 occasions, participant BKFO scores reduced beyond the MDC (21%). A relationship between both squeeze tests and HAGOS (sport) was observed explaining 12% variance for short-lever (R2 = 0.121, p = 0.006) and 7% for long-lever (R2 = 0.065, p = 0.046) tests. The BKFO showed no statistically significant (P = > 0.05) correlation to either squeeze test (rp = 0.153/0.193) or HAGOS (sport) (rp = 0.182). Conclusion: This study adds to literature surrounding monitoring of hip/groin measures in footballers. The long-lever adductor squeeze detected meaningful changes more frequently than the short-lever. Both tests shared weak, albeit statistically significant relationships with HAGOS (sport), whilst the BKFO did not. A larger prospective study is warranted to increase confidence in selecting these measures in this setting.

Ten team sport players (age 22 ± 1 years) were enrolled in this crossover study and performed 1271 trials (436 Apex vs. Apex, 464 Viper vs. Viper, 371 Apex vs. Viper) consisting of 5-10 m, 10-15 m, 15-20 m, and 20-30 m sprints. Inter-unit reliability was calculated using the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) with 95% confidence interval (CI) and coefficient of variation (CV), while between-unit and model analysis were subsequently performed to evaluate differences in Vpeak. Apex (10 Hz) units had excellent inter-unit reliability for all distances, whereas Viper (10 Hz) units had good to excellent reliability. The CV was good (< 5%) for both GNSS models. Significant differences were found in Vpeak in Sprint 5-10 = 0.13 CI (0.08, 0.182) m. s-1, Sprint 10-15 = 0.06 CI (0.01, 0.1) m. s-1, and in Sprint overall = 0.06 CI (0.03, 0.09) m. s-1. Both Viper and Apex units can consistently report Vpeak measurements since good to excellent ICC and good CV were found. However, Vpeak measurements are significantly different between models for distances less than 15 m. In conclusion, this study shows that differences exist among manufacturers' models and that the two GNSS models should not be used interchangeably to quantify Vpeak.

Cross-sectional analysis of incidence, age, and sex and specific injury diagnoses, mechanisms, and facial locations were performed. We focused on craniofacial and soft tissue injuries and excluded patients with concussion or other neurological injuries. Results: A total of 24,905 cases were identified in the NEISS database, corresponding to an estimated, 764,293 emergency department visits. The most hazardous sports were basketball, accounting for 356,188 visits (46.6%), football with 249,633 visits (32.6%), and soccer with 128,113 (14.7%) visits. Lacrosse and ice hockey accounted for 16,869 (1.9%) and 13,490 (1.5%) visits, respectively. There has been a decrease in injuries over the past 10 years, particularly for football (53%), ice hockey (46%), and lacrosse (41%). Soccer (13%) and basketball (9%) noticed the smallest decreases. Conclusion: Children who play basketball, football and soccer are especially prone to emergency department visits related to the head and neck. Overall, there has been an improvement in number of injuries across the five sports investigated. Sports amenable to head and neck protective equipment saw the largest improvement (football, ice hockey, lacrosse), whereas only small decreases were noted in basketball and soccer. Changes in regulations for sports not amenable to more protective equipment may help decrease adverse events.","2019","2020-05-20 00:12:46","2020-05-20 00:12:46",NA,"6-9",NA,"","121",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Embase Medline",NA,NA,NA,"; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijporl.2019.02.036; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2001662825","female; human; male; article; football; soccer; sport injury; basketball; priority journal; controlled study; incidence; major clinical study; adolescent; athlete; retrospective study; cross-sectional study; child; school child; ice hockey; face injury; soft tissue injury; emergency ward; contact sport; age distribution; head and neck injury; population research; protective equipment; sex ratio",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

There is a lack of research on vestibulo-ocular function in sporting adolescents, and the influence of previous concussions on the vestibular system in this population. The aim of this study was to investigate vestibulo-ocular function in a cohort of adolescent rugby players with and without a history of concussion during pre-season assessment. Design: Cross-sectional cohort. Methods: 213 male adolescent (13–18 years old) rugby players were recruited from six schools in Queensland, Australia. Vestibulo-ocular assessments were conducted during the preseason and included clinical assessment of oculomotor function and the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) using the clinical and video-Head Impulse Test (HIT). Players were allocated into two groups: no history of concussion in the last 12 months (n = 165); and concussion in the last 12 months (n = 48). Results: There were no between group differences in vestibulo-ocular function for players with and without a history of concussion (p = 0.65). However, vestibulo-ocular dysfunction was reported in 69 (32.7%) of the players tested, who had either abnormal oculomotor control or VOR function. Conclusions: The high prevalence of vestibulo-ocular dysfunction in adolescent rugby players suggests that positive clinical findings post-concussion need to be interpreted carefully in the absence of baseline or pre-concussion assessments.","2019","2020-05-20 00:57:34","2020-05-20 00:57:34",NA,"144-149",NA,"","39",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Embase Medline",NA,NA,NA,"; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.msksp.2018.12.007; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2001419060","adult; human; male; article; rugby; priority journal; major clinical study; adolescent; athlete; cohort analysis; concussion; young adult; cross-sectional study; Queensland; clinical assessment; school; head impulse test; eye movement control; vestibular disorder; vestibulo ocular dysfunction; vestibuloocular reflex",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Despite the numerous available data on adult elite athletes' cardiac parameters, there is considerably less information on youth athletes. Our goal was to determine physiological cardiac adaptation in young competitive athletes and to determine the relationship between cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) parameters and clinical and spiroergometry data. Methods: Analysing the morphological and functional parameters by CMR and spiroergometry, we comprehensively studied the degree and quality of cardiac adaptation in asymptomatic young athletes (n = 84; 68 male; 16.6 ± 2.3 ys; 13.1 ± 6.5 training hours/week) performing sports with high dynamic component (football n = 48, water polo n = 22, swimming n = 14) and healthy non-athletes (n = 30; 17 male; 18,4 ys, <5 training hours/week). Using CMR we evaluated left (LV) and right ventricular (RV) ejection fraction (EF), body surface area related enddiastolic (EDVi), end-systolic (ESVi), stroke volume (SVi) and mass (Mi). Maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) as a generally accepted indicator of endurance capacity was assessed using spiroergometry. Results: Compared to the non-athlete group, young athletes showed significantly higher LVEDVi (109.6 ± 13.4 vs 92.3 ± 9.4 ml/m2), RVEDVi (110.1 ± 15.3 vs 94.1 ± 10.9 ml/m2), LVSVi (65.2 ± 8.9 vs 54.4 ± 7.3 ml/m2), RVSVi (63.6 ± 9.1 vs 53.4 ml/m2), LVMi (70.0 ± 11.0 vs 48.9 ± 9.4 g/m2) and VO2max (3.7 ± 0.8 vs 3.1 ± 0.8 l/min). VO2max showed a positive correlation with LVEDVi (p < 0.0001; r = 0.41), RVEDVi (p < 0.0001; r = 0.41) and LVMi (p < 0.0001; r = 0.56), RVMi (p < 0.01; r = 0.34). Analyzing age, gender, training hours/week and sports type gender and training hours/week seemed to be an independent predictor of elevated LVEDVi (p < 0.05 beta=-0,31; p < 0.01 beta = 0.65), elevated RVEDVi (p < 0.01 beta=-0.35; p < 0.05 beta = 0.50) and elevated LVMi (p < 0.0001 beta=-0.677, p < 0.0001 beta = 0.67). Conclusion: In young athletes gender and training hours seem to be an independent predictor of morphological changes called athlete's heart. In youth competitive athletes an apparent correlation was found between spiroergometry and CMR data. Imbalance between morphological and functional adaptation may raise the suspicion of an underlying pathology.","2019","2020-05-20 00:12:58","2020-05-20 00:12:58",NA,"i778",NA,"","20",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Embase",NA,NA,NA,"; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ehjci/jey250; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L630838004","adult; conference abstract; female; human; male; football; aerobic capacity; controlled study; major clinical study; athlete; gender; juvenile; endurance; swimming; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; body surface; water polo; heart right ventricle ejection fraction; heart stroke volume",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Objective: The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of SAFT90 on lactate production, heart rate (HR) and rate of subjective perceived exertion (RPE) expressed by Borg scale (6-20). Methods: Fourteen male elite junior soccer players (age 15.9 ± 0.2 years, stature 180.8 ± 5.5 cm, body mass 69.8 ± 5.8 kg, body fat 8.1 ± 3.2%, VO2max 57.6 ± 4.7 ml⋅kg-1⋅min-1, maximum heart rate 192.8 ± 4.6 beats⋅min-1) participated in this study. Lactate concentration, HR and RPE were monitored during specific fatigue exercise protocol SAFT90. Results: Results of HR showed mean values of153 ± 15 beats⋅min-1, mean blood lactate concentration was 1.9 ± 0.5 mmol⋅L-1. A mean value of RPE was 11.0 ± 1.4 that corresponds to ""fairly light"" exercise. No significant change was found between consecutive SAFT90 stages for HR and lactate concentration. For Borg scale, there were significant increases between stages 20 min and 45 min and between stages 70 min and 90 min. Change between stages 45 and 70 min was not significant. Conclusions: In respect to study results, we suggest that specific fatigue protocol SAFT90 applied in U16 soccer players appears to be insufficient in terms of exercise intensity to achieve comparable lactate concentration, HR and RPE values with a soccer match.

Methods: Twenty-one female players from the Brazilian National Soccer Team were monitored in twenty-two on-field training sessions during the 30-day preparatory training camp prior to the 2016 Olympic Games. Activities were categorized into warmup (WU), small sided games (SSG), technical and tactical training (TTT) and friendly matches (FM). The activity profile in each type of drill was then compared to the ones of the 6 matches performed during the Rio 2016 Olympic Games. Results: It was found that distance traveled at different speeds were higher during matches compared to WU, SSG, and TTT, but not compared to FM. Frequency of accelerations was similar between matches and TTT, SSG and FM. Repeated acceleration and sprints were higher during Matches compared to WU, TTT, SSG but FM presented similar results. Conclusion: It was concluded that although there were different acceleration and deceleration demands amongst WU, SSG and TTT compared to match-play, FM was the only training activity which consistently replicated or exceeded Olympic matches' physical demands.

Another method to estimate training load in contact sports is the rating of perceived exertion of a player, which is based on a questionnaire. It however takes a long time to obtain answers to questionnaires in team sports. As a solution to this problem, we developed a wearable heart rate monitor for rugby players. The garment-type monitor with flank electrodes can measure the heart rate even in rugby training situations. We also propose a method to estimate the training load from the measured heart rate. The method can be used instead of a questionnaire administered to the players and can reduce the labor in the estimation of the training load.","2019","2020-05-20 00:33:09","2020-05-20 00:33:09",NA,"4121-4124",NA,"","2019",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Medline",NA,NA,NA,"; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2019.8857595; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L630651552","human; human experiment; article; rugby; exercise; heart rate; controlled study; team sport; questionnaire; face injury; contact sport; electrode",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, limited knowledge exists about the impact of anxiety on the use of such contextual priors when forming our decisions. We provide a novel insight into the combined impact of contextual priors and anxiety on anticipation in soccer. Altogether, 12 expert soccer players were required to predict the actions of an oncoming opponent while viewing life-sized video simulations of 2-versus-2 defensive scenarios. Performance effectiveness and processing efficiency were measured under four conditions: no contextual priors (CP) about the action tendencies of the opponent and low anxiety (LA); no CP and high anxiety (HA); CP and LA; CP and HA. The provision of contextual priors did not affect processing efficiency, but it improved performance effectiveness on congruent trials. Anxiety negatively affected processing efficiency, but this did not affect the use of contextual priors or influence performance effectiveness. It appears that anxiety and prior contextual information impact attentional resources independent of each other.

Methods: 1,314 athletes from 2012-15 underwent ECG screening prior to participation in the National Football League combine. Formal interpretation standards were evolving over this period & criteria used were at the discretion of the physician. ECGs were retrospectively reviewed by 2 cardiologists with expertise in sports cardiology using the IC. “Common themes” of ECG patterns were identified upon application of IC that resulted in a change from initial read. Results: Applying the IC reduced the number of participants with abnormal ECG findings from 198 (15.1%) to 69 (5.3%). 16 “common themes” (Table) were identified that contributed to reclassification of the initial interpretation. Some form of T-wave abnormality accounted for 35% of those “common themes”. Conclusion: Modern athlete ECG interpretation criteria have evolved rapidly & physician education is important. Compared to using the IC, this real-world analysis revealed a high initial abnormal rate & identified “common themes” leading to Not Normal ECGs.

Various studies have investigated injury mechanisms, prevention programmes and immediate medical management of these injuries. However, relatively scant attention has been placed on the player's experience of such an injury and the importance of context. AIM: The aim of this study was to explore the injury experience and its related context, as perceived by the catastrophically injured player. METHODS: A qualitative approach was followed to explore the immediate, postevent injury experience. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 48 (n=48) players who had sustained a rugby-related ASCI. RESULTS: Four themes were derived from the data. Participants described the context around the injury incident, which may be valuable to help understand the mechanism of injury and potentially minimise risk. Participants also described certain contributing factors to their injury, which included descriptions of foul play and aggression, unaccustomed playing positions, pressure to perform and unpreparedness. The physical experience included signs and symptoms of ASCI that is important to recognise by first aiders, fellow teammates, coaches and referees. Lastly, participants described the emotional experience which has implications for all ASCI first responders. SIGNIFICANCE: All rugby stakeholders, including players, first responders, coaches and referees, may gain valuable information from the experiences of players who have sustained these injuries. This information is also relevant for rugby safety initiatives in shaping education and awareness interventions.","2019","2020-05-20 00:26:06","2020-05-20 00:26:06",NA,"313-320",NA,"4","25",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Medline",NA,NA,NA,"; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/injuryprev-2018-042871; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628819799","adult; human; male; football; sport injury; injury; pathophysiology; spinal cord injury; adolescent; young adult; risk factor; middle aged; aged; qualitative research; aggression; disabled person; life event",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

METHODS: Test-retest reliability (noise) and weekly variation (signal) data were collected from 42 professional Australian footballers from 1 club during a competition season. Perceptual wellness was measured via questionnaires completed before main training sessions (48, 72, and 96 h postmatch), with players providing a rating (1-5 Likert scale) regarding their muscle soreness, sleep quality, fatigue level, stress, and motivation. Eccentric hamstring force and countermovement jumps were assessed via proprietary systems once per week. Heart rate recovery was assessed via a standard submaximal run test on a grass-covered field with players wearing a heart rate monitor. The heart rate recovery was calculated by subtracting average heart rate during final 10 seconds of rest from average heart rate during final 30 seconds of exercise. Typical test error was reported as coefficient of variation percentage (CV%) and intraclass coefficients. Sensitivity was calculated by dividing weekly CV% by test CV% to produce a signal to noise ratio. RESULTS: All measures displayed acceptable sensitivity. Signal to noise ratio ranged from 1.3 to 11.1. Intraclass coefficients ranged from .30 to .97 for all measures. CONCLUSIONS: The heart rate recovery test, countermovement jump test, eccentric hamstring force test, and perceptual wellness all possess acceptable measurement sensitivity. Signal to noise ratio analysis is a novel method of assessing measurement characteristics of monitoring tools. These data can be used by coaches and scientists to identify meaningful changes in common measures of fitness and fatigue in professional Australian football.","2019","2020-05-20 00:31:09","2020-05-20 00:31:09",NA,"1-7",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Medline",NA,NA,NA,"; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1123/ijspp.2019-0060; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629600033","football player; human; article; hamstring muscle; exercise; heart rate; controlled study; season; competition; questionnaire; fatigue; motivation; nonhuman; stress; Likert scale; test retest reliability; sleep quality; grass; signal noise ratio",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

To understand how helmets provide head protection, quantification of the relative motion between the head and the helmet is necessary. The purpose of this study was to compare helmet and head kinematics and quantify the relative motion of helmet with respect to head during experimental representations of on-field American football impact scenarios. Seven helmet-To-helmet impact configurations were simulated by propelling helmeted crash test dummies into each other. Head and helmet kinematics were measured with instrumentation and an optical motion capture system. The analysis of results, from 10 ms prior to the helmet contact to 20 ms after the loss of helmet contact, showed that the helmets translated 12-41 mm and rotated up to 37 deg with respect to the head. The peak resultant linear acceleration of the helmet was about 2-5 times higher than the head. The peak resultant angular velocity of the helmet ranged from 37% less to 71% more than the head, depending on the impact conditions. The results of this study demonstrate that the kinematics of the head and the helmet are noticeably different and that the helmet rotates significantly with respect to the head during impacts. Therefore, capturing the helmet kinematics using a video motion tracking methodology is not sufficient to study the biomechanics of the head. Head motion must be measured independently of the helmet.","2019","2020-05-20 00:41:02","2020-05-20 00:41:02",NA,"",NA,"8","141",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Embase",NA,NA,NA,"; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1115/1.4043038; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L627560627","article; football; acceleration; helmet; velocity; simulation; kinematics; quantitative analysis; motion analysis system; head movement; crash test dummy",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

METHODS: 23 professional and semi-professional ARF players, performed six CMJs and three, eight-second 50-meter runs every 30 s (SRT), seven days apart. Absolute and trial-to-trial reliability was represented as a coefficient of variation (CV) ± 90% confidence intervals (CI). Test-retest reliability was examined using the magnitude of the difference (effect size (ES) ± 90% CI) from week 1 to week 2. The smallest worthwhile change (SWC) was calculated as 0.25 x SD. RESULTS: Good reliability (CVs = 6.6 - 9.3%) was determined for all variables except eccentric displacement (CV = 12.8%), with no clear changes observed in any variables between week 1 and week 2. All variables from the SRT possessed a CV < SWC, indicating an ability to detect practically important changes in performance. Only peak velocity from the CMJ test possessed a CV < SWC, exhibiting a limitation of this test in detecting practically meaningful changes within this environment. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that while all variables possess acceptable reliability, a SRT might offer to be a more sensitive monitoring tool than a CMJ test within high-performance ARF, due to its greater ability for detecting practically important changes in performance.","2019","2020-05-20 00:11:42","2020-05-20 00:11:42",NA,"1-17",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Medline",NA,NA,NA,"; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1123/ijspp.2019-0150; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L627621175","football player; human; article; monitoring; effect size; quantitative analysis; test retest reliability",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Injury surveillance was prospectively employed to capture all the HSI occurring in the 2013/2014 season. There were 18 HSIs. Injury distribution was 55.6% dominant leg and 44.4% non-dominant leg. The model generated by the SmooteBoostM1 technique with a cost-sensitive ADTree as the base classifier reported the best evaluation criteria (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve score=0.837, true positive rate=77.8%, true negative rate=83.8%) and hence was considered the best for predicting HSI. The prediction model showed moderate to high accuracy for identifying professional soccer players at risk of HSI during pre-season screenings.

However, it is unclear whether the detrimental effect is different to the increased injury risk following other injury types. Such knowledge would inform injury prevention strategies during concussion rehabilitation and subsequent return to play. This study aimed to compare subsequent injury rates, regions, and timeframes in elite Australian football players who sustained concussion and non-concussion injuries. Methods: Public Australian Football League (AFL) injury lists were monitored during the 2017 and 2018 competitive seasons to identify injured players. Injured players were split into two groups based on whether their first injury of the season was a concussion (concussion group) or a non-head knock related injury (control group). Subsequent injury rates per/1000 games and subsequent injury body regions (head, upper limb, trunk, lower limb and illness) were compared between groups using incident rate ratios (IRR) and Chi-square tests, respectively. Subgroup comparisons were performed based on concussion severity (number of weeks injured) and the timing of the subsequent injury (number of weeks after the concussion). Results: Ninety-six concussion and 663 control injured players were identified. Subsequent injury rates were not different between concussion and control groups (IRR 1.02 [95 % CI: 0.78–1.33]; p = 0.894). Players returning from a concussion were less likely to sustain subsequent lower limb injuries (52.4 % vs 69.7 %, respectively; p = 0.010) and more likely to sustain subsequent head, upper limb or trunk injuries (41.3 % vs 25.4 %, respectively; p = 0.013). Subsequent illness rates were not different between concussion and control groups (6.3 % vs 5.0 %, respectively; p = 0.871). Subsequent injury rates were similar amongst concussed players who were injured for 1, 2, and > 2 weeks (67 vs 87 vs 51 injuries/1000games, respectively; p > 0.289) and also similar in games 1–4, 5–8, 9–12, and > 12 after returning to play (45 vs 65 vs 79 vs 52 injuries/1000games, respectively; p > 0.180). Discussion: These findings suggest that subsequent injury rate is similar between concussion and other injury types, regardless of concussion severity and number of games since returning to play. Subsequent injuries following a concussion were more likely to occur in the head, upper limb and trunk compared to typical AFL injuries. The reasons for this should be further explored and considered within concussion rehabilitation and return to play programs.

The GPET instrument was used to analyse the decision-making and execution of 3442 actions measured during competitive matches (pass, dribbling and shooting). Both variables were analysed with regard to the three tactical principles of attack: keep the ball possession, progression towards the goal and shooting at goal with the lowest level of opposition. With respect to the pass, results showed significantly higher values in decision-making and execution in the first and second principles, but not in the third one. In the dribbling action, results showed significantly higher values in decision-making in the second and third principle, but not in the first one.

Individual exposure to match play and training, injury incidence and characteristics (player position, injury mechanism, type of injuries, severity of injuries, recurrent vs. new injuries, season variation of injury pattern) in a female futsal team were prospectively recorded for three consecutive seasons (2015-2018). Incidences were calculated per 1,000 h of exposure. A total of 30 injuries were reported during the three seasons within a total exposure of 4,446.1 h. The overall, match and training incidence of injuries were 6.7, 6.4 and 6.8 injuries/1,000 h of exposure, respectively. Most injuries had a non-contact mechanism (93%), with the lower extremity being the most frequently injured anatomical region (5.62 injuries/1,000 h of exposure). The most common type of injury was muscle/tendon (4.9 injuries/1,000 h of exposure) followed by joint (nonbone) and ligament (1.3 injuries/1,000 h of exposure). The injuries with the highest injury burden were those that occurred at the knee (31.9 days loss/1,000 h exposure), followed by quadriceps (15.3 day loss/1,000 h) and hamstring (14.4 day loss/1,000 h) strains. The first few weeks of competition after pre-season and soon after the Christmas break were the time points when most injuries occurred. These data indicate that sub-elite female futsal players are exposed to a substantial risk of sustaining an injury. To reduce overall injury burden, efforts should be directed toward the design, implementation and assessment of preventative measures that target the most common diagnoses, namely, muscle/tendon and ligament injuries.","2019","2020-05-20 00:27:28","2020-05-20 00:27:28",NA,"",NA,"11","2019",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Embase",NA,NA,NA,"; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.7989; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L629925909","adult; female; human; article; hamstring muscle; injury; incidence; major clinical study; prospective study; young adult; follow up; fracture; muscle injury; leg injury; quadriceps femoris muscle; contusion; anterior cruciate ligament; injury severity; ankle sprain; ankle injury; ligament injury; seasonal variation; bone stress; tendon injury; achilles tendon; lower leg",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

A comparison of training modality and total genotype scores to enhance sport-specific biomotor abilities in under 19 male soccer players. J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2019-Soccer-specific training (SST) and small-sided games (SSGs) have been shown to develop physical proficiency in soccer. Research on genetics and epigenetics in the prescription of training is limited. The aims of this study were to compare the impact of 3 different SST/SSG methods and investigate if a total genotype score (TGS) influences training response. Subjects (n = 30 male soccer players, mean ± SD; age 17.2 ± 0.9 years, stature = 172.6 ± 6.2 cm; body mass = 71.7 ± 10.1 kg) were stratified into a ""power"" (PG) or ""endurance"" (EG) gene profile group, where a 15 single nucleotide polymorphism panel was used to produce an algorithmically weighted TGS. Training 1 (T1-SSGs only), training 2 (T2-SSGs/SST), and training 3 (T3-SST only) were completed (in that respective order), lasting 8 weeks each, interspersed by 4-week washouts. Acceleration (10-m sprint) was improved by T2 only (1.84 ± 0.09 seconds vs. 1.73 ± 0.05 seconds; Effect Size [ES] = 1.59, p < 0.001). Speed (30-m sprint) was improved by T2 (4.46 ± 0.22 seconds vs. 4.30 ± 0.19 seconds; ES = 0.81, p < 0.001) and T3 (4.48 ± 0.22 seconds vs. 4.35 ± 0.21 seconds; ES = 0.58, p < 0.001). Agility (T-test) was improved by T1 (10.14 ± 0.40 seconds vs. 9.84 ± 0.42 seconds; ES = 0.73, p < 0.05) and T3 (9.93 ± 0.38 seconds vs. 9.66 ± 0.45 seconds; ES = 0.66, p < 0.001). Endurance (Yo-Yo level 1) was improved by T1 (1,682.22 ± 497.23 m vs. 2,028.89 ± 604.74 m; ES = 0.63, p < 0.05), T2 (1,904.35 ± 526.77 m vs. 2,299.13 ± 606.97 m; ES = 0.69, p < 0.001), and T3 (1,851.76 ± 490.46 m vs. 2,024.35 ± 588.13 m; ES = 0.35, p < 0.05). Power (countermovement jump) was improved by T3 only (36.01 ± 5.73 cm vs. 37.14 ± 5.62 cm; ES = 0.20, p < 0.05). There were no differences in T1, T2, and T3 combined when comparing PG and EG. The PG reported significantly (χ(20) = 4.42, p = 0.035, ES = 0.48) better training responses to T3 for power than the EG. These results demonstrate the efficacy of SSGs and SSTs in developing biomotor abilities. Although these results refute talent identification through the use of a TGS, there may be use in aligning the training method to TGS to develop power-based qualities in soccer.","2019","2020-05-20 00:12:12","2020-05-20 00:12:12",NA,"",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Medline",NA,NA,NA,"; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1519/JSC.0000000000003299; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L630061125","human; human experiment; male; article; soccer player; acceleration; clinical article; controlled study; adolescent; agility; endurance; body height; effect size; prescription; genetic association; gene frequency; drug efficacy; epigenetics; genetic profile; single nucleotide polymorphism",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

It was hypothesized in the present study that periodic inhalation of carbon monoxide (CO) might elicit similar physiological adaptations compared to altitude training. Methods: Twelve male college student athletes, who were well-trained soccer players, participated. They performed a 4-week treadmill-training program, five times a week. Participants were randomly assigned into an experimental group with inhaling CO (INCO) (1 mL/kg body weight for 2 min) in O2 (4 L) before all training sessions and a control group without inhaling CO (NOCO). CO and EPO concentrations in venous blood were first measured acutely at the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 6th, and 8th hour after INCO, and total hemoglobin mass (tHb), running economy and VO2max were measured before and after the 4 weeks training intervention. Results: HbCO% increased from 0.7 to 4.4% (P < 0.05) after 1 h of CO inhalation and EPO increased from 1.9 to 2.7 mIU/mL after 4 h post CO inhalation (P < 0.05) acutely before the intervention. After the training, the tHb and VO2max in the INCO group increased significantly by 3.7 and 2.7%, respectively, while no significant differences were observed in the NOCO condition. O2 uptake at given submaximal speeds declined by approximately 4% in the INCO group. Conclusion: Acutely, EPO increased sharply post CO inhalation, peaking at 4 h post inhalation. 4-weeks of training with CO inhalation before exercise sessions improved tHb and VO2max as well as running economy, suggesting that moderate CO inhalation could be a new method to improve the endurance performance in athletes.","2019","2020-05-20 00:33:02","2020-05-20 00:33:02",NA,"",NA,"JUN","10",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Embase",NA,NA,NA,"; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2019.00701; http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L628533060","adult; human; human experiment; male; article; soccer player; aerobic capacity; oxygen consumption; controlled study; young adult; running; erythrocyte; hematocrit; hemoglobin; mean corpuscular volume; normal human; venous blood; treadmill exercise; altitude; college student; endurance training; adaptation; carbon monoxide; carbon monoxide inhalation; erythropoietin; inhalation",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Participants were 110 outfield players from academies of 2 professional soccer clubs in Japan. Forty-eight 11-a-side official league matches (13, 6, 9, 7, 6, and 7 matches for U13, U14, U15, U16, U17, and U18 age-groups, respectively) were analyzed (152 complete match files). Global positioning system (15 Hz) and video analysis were used to analyze running and technical performance during matches, respectively. Total distance covered in absolute terms (U13 < [U14 and U15] < [U16-U18]; p < 0.05 for all), high-intensity running distance ([U13-U15] < [U16-U18]; p < 0.05 for all), and distance covered during the metabolic power zone of ≥35 W·kg relative to match playing time ([U13 < U16], [U13-U15] < [U17 and U18]; p < 0.05 for all) increased with age. The speed zone based approach (high-intensity running distance, ≥4.0 m·s) underestimated high-intensity demands compared with the metabolic power zone based approach (≥20 W·kg) by ∼33 to ∼57% (p < 0.01 for all), with the underestimation declining with age (p < 0.001). Pass accuracy improved with age from 73% at U13 to 85% at U18 (p < 0.001). Therefore, distance covered at high speeds and at high metabolic powers, and pass accuracy increase with age. Moreover, the speed zone based approach underestimates the demands of match play in Japanese elite youth soccer players.

The occurrence of injuries has a negative impact not only on individual athletes but also on the whole team and is a burden to society. The level of prevention is directly proportional to the education of coaches, who are the key persons in delivering preventive programmes to players. Objective: The aim of the paper was to identify the effect of a one-day workshop on the attitudes of amateur-level youth football coaches to the injury prevention programme, its implementation in the training process, and its sustainability over time. Methods: A ""RE-AIM"" questionnaire was developed to assess the views of coaches 6 months after attending an injury prevention workshop. A total of 112 coaches were addressed, 22 of whom completed the questionnaire. Results: A positive effect of a one-day workshop on coaches' attitudes on injury prevention was observed. All coaches have incorporated prevention programs into the training process. More than half of the coaches use prevention programs at least once a week. The use of injury prevention features was maintained even six months after the seminar. Conclusions: A workshop consisting of a theoretical and practical part can be considered an effective tool in coach education in the context of injury prevention.
